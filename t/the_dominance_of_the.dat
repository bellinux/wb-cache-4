5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Navy and the impossibility, {{as he saw}} it, of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented {{by a number of}} cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E
5|$|Kress von Kressenstein's {{force had}} {{been active in}} the area since the First Suez Offensive of early 1915, when three columns {{attacked}} the Canal along the northern, central, and southern routes across the Sinai Peninsula. The growing Imperial strength made attacks on the Suez Canal difficult, and ended <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman force in the area. The Ottoman Empire's attacks on 23 April demonstrated their intention to continue opposing the British Empire in the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of the Big Four is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America. It has also been argued that <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E
5|$|Hampden is an all-seated bowl stadium, {{although}} {{the ground is}} split into four geographic sections, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Due to <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Firm within Scottish football and their regular qualification for cup matches played at Hampden, the East and West stands {{are commonly known as}} the Celtic and Rangers ends. The East Stand has 12,800 seats on a single tier of 53 rows. The two end stands are up to 140metres away from the pitch, due to Hampden retaining its bowl shape after it was redeveloped. This distance is almost as great as if Hampden included an athletics track, {{although the}} distance between the pitch and the two side stands is more comparable to a normal football stadium.|$|E

5|$|Harvey then {{returned}} to productivity with 145 against Warwickshire and added a further half-century in the remaining matches. He also took 5/57 in an innings to help set up a seven-wicket win over the Minor Counties, although the match was not first-class. Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19.70 in five Tests with two half centuries. It was by far his most unproductive summer in England, with 976 runs at 31.48. Such was <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laker-Lock-led attack that Harvey was Australia's fifth-highest runscorer in the Tests and fourth in the first-class matches.|$|E
5|$|Prior to <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was {{dominant}} and {{this resulted in}} their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was compounded by the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was built like a fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E
5|$|Small first played cricket in Trinidad for a club of low social status. After {{establishing}} {{himself in}} the Trinidad team, he soon {{made a name for}} himself as a batsman and was one of the few black batsmen in the West Indies team at the time. For Trinidad, he was one of the cricketers instrumental in breaking <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barbados cricket team in the Inter-Colonial Tournament. He first played for West Indies in 1912–13 and, after the First World War, was chosen to tour England twice. He was moderately successful on the 1923 tour, but was less effective in 1928. Small played in the middle of the batting order; he bowled either medium-fast or off breaks. He died in 1958.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor {{was based}} on the {{consolidation}} of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Troude's {{squadron}} {{to escape the}} British pursuit highlights <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies. Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had {{no alternative but to}} wait for the inevitable British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Viewing elves {{as being}} more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, {{that may or may}} not be Christian. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church.|$|E

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal party in such matters.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South. By 1865, Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E

5|$|From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved {{unable to}} break <b>the</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon {{antagonism}} rendered {{the defense of}} the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. While George William had claimed neutrality before, the presence of Wallenstein's army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg, George William again claimed neutrality, yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses and subsidies. Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 Kriegsmarine surface vessels {{had carried}} out {{commerce}} raiding sorties {{in support of}} the German U-Boats in the Battle of the Atlantic. In January 1941 Operation Berlin was launched followed by Operation Rheinübung in May 1941. <b>The</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy's surface fleet prevented the German units returning to ports in the Baltic sea or Germany. The surviving ships, the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the cruiser Prinz Eugen, docked in the port of Brest, France. Throughout 1941 RAF Bomber Command attacked the ships in dock. The proximity of the ports to Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields allowed a large number of sorties to be flown against the targets in quick succession. The Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command), and Adolf Hitler desired to move the ships out of range from potential air raids.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent President Rutherford B. Hayes did {{not seek}} re-election, keeping a promise made during the 1876 campaign. After the longest {{convention}} in the party's history, the divided Republicans chose another Ohioan, Representative James A. Garfield, as their standard-bearer. The Democratic Party chose General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania as their nominee. <b>The</b> <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two major parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the Greenback Party, nominated another Civil War general for president, Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver. In a campaign fought mainly over issues of Civil War loyalties, tariffs, and Chinese immigration, Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Weaver and two other minor candidates, Neal Dow and John W. Phelps, together made up the remaining percentage. The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won by the Republicans, the second longest winning streak in American history after the Democratic-Republican Party during the period 1800–1824.|$|E
