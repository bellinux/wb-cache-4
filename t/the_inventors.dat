5000|$|In {{contrast}} with U.S. patent law, the applicant for a European patent needs not be <b>the</b> <b>inventor.</b> <b>The</b> {{right to the}} European patent may validly be transferred before the filing of the application, e.g. by contract, by inheritance, or {{as a consequence of}} the [...] "employee's rights" [...] as determined by the applicable national law. However, <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> has <b>the</b> right to be mentioned as such before the EPO [...] The EPO does not verify the accuracy of the designation of <b>the</b> <b>inventor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>inventor</b> may waive its right to be mentioned as such in the European patent application and European patent specification.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be very}} {{difficult}} to demonstrate diligence. <b>The</b> <b>inventor,</b> for example, must work continuously on the invention. If <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> works on another invention before the first one is reduced to practice, that destroys the continuity and <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> is deemed to not have been sufficiently diligent to be entitled to a patent. Many other restrictions apply as well.|$|R

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes {{to know of}} the treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of <b>the</b> <b>inventors</b> killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): <b>The</b> <b>inventors</b> of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

5000|$|Filing {{by other}} than inventor: An entity can file an {{application}} on behalf of an inventor who assigned or is under an obligation to assign the invention rights to the entity (or if the entity otherwise has financial interest in the invention), without seeking <b>the</b> <b>inventor's</b> execution of <b>the</b> application. However, any patent that issues belongs to <b>the</b> <b>inventor,</b> absent a written assignment from <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> or <b>inventor's</b> estate to <b>the</b> entity.|$|R
5|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{was invented by}} physicists Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. The pair worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories specializing {{in the development of}} cathode ray tubes that used electronic signal outputs to project a signal onto television screens. Goldsmith, who had received a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1936 with a focus on oscilloscope design, was {{at the time of the}} device's invention the director of research for DuMont Laboratories in New Jersey. The two inventors were inspired by the radar displays used in World War II, which Goldsmith had worked on during the war. The patent for the device was filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948. The patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used by either <b>the</b> <b>inventors</b> or DuMont Laboratories, and the device was never manufactured beyond original handmade prototype. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers historian Alex Magoun has speculated that Goldsmith did not make the prototype with the intent for it to be the basis of any future production, but only designed the device as a demonstration of the kind of commercial opportunities DuMont could pursue. Goldsmith did not work on games after the invention of the device; he was promoted to vice president in 1953 and left DuMont—by then split up and sold to other firms—to become a professor of physics at Furman University in 1966. Goldsmith kept the device and brought it with him to Furman; in a 2016 interview fellow physics professor Bill Brantley recalled Goldsmith demonstrating the game to him.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of an {{inventor}} who brings to the market an innovation that can be legally copied. Imitators may `enter' the market by copying the innovation at a cost or by buying from <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>the</b> knowledge necessary to reproduce and use the invention. The possibility of contracting dramatically affects the need for patent protection. Indeed, our results reveal that: (i) Imitators wait to enter the market and <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> becomes a temporary monopolist; (ii) <b>The</b> <b>inventor</b> offers contracts which allow resale of the knowledge by the imitators; (iii) The proffits of <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> typically increase {{with the number of}} potential imitators...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{a patent}} family {{from a country}} {{is defined as a}} family {{containing}} at least one patent of which at least one applicant is from that country. The applicant’s country is used instead of <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> country because <b>the</b> applicants designate the owners or party in control of the invention, mostly firms (OECD 2009). Therefore it reflects the innovative performance of the given country’s firms, while <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> country is usually <b>the</b> <b>inventor’s</b> professional address.|$|R

40|$|A {{principal}} {{must decide}} whether or not to implement a project which originated with one of her employees. The employees have private information about the quality of the project. A successfully implemented project raises <b>the</b> <b>inventor's</b> chance of promotion, at his peer's expense, but a failed project may ruin <b>the</b> <b>inventor's</b> career. If <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> is already ahead in his career, then he may be tempted to suppress his own ideas in order not to risk a big failure. If he is not ahead, then he is instead tempted to exaggerate the quality of his ideas in order to get ahead. The peer may either try to promote <b>the</b> <b>inventor's</b> bad ideas to see him fail, or to denigrate promising ideas to stop <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> from getting ahead. Within the class of incentive compatible and renegotiation-proof mechanisms, self-assessment (without any peer reports) is optimal. Truthtelling can be guaranteed in different ways. For example, to avoid the exaggeration effect, <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> can be promised some chance of promotion even if his project is cancelled, or he can be paid a relatively high wage when he is not promoted. We show how the optimal method depends on the parameters. ...|$|R
50|$|Invention in the U.S. is {{generally}} defined to comprise two steps: (1) {{conception of the}} invention and (2) reduction to practice of the invention. When an inventor conceives of an invention and diligently reduces the invention to practice (by filing a patent application, by practicing the invention, etc.), <b>the</b> <b>inventor's</b> date of invention will be the date of conception. Thus, provided an inventor is diligent in actually reducing an application to practice, {{he or she will}} be <b>the</b> first <b>inventor</b> and <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> entitled to a patent, even if another files a patent application, constructively reducing the invention to practice, before <b>the</b> <b>inventor.</b>|$|R
40|$|We analyze a model where a financially {{constrained}} inventor has {{to decide}} whether to work as an employee in a firm’s lab or establish a start-up company. Only <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> knows whether he is a high or low type. If he chooses to set up a start-up, it reduces his productivity, as he has to deal with the bureaucracy himself. We show that in high payo projects and <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> employed in <b>the</b> lab, the compensation of <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> will be a proportion of the prevailing (non-invention) market wage. Furthermore, we characterize the case, when, despite the productivity reduction, a start-up increases his expected compensa-tion. The preference of <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> for a start-up works opposite for the financing firm. This may be a possible explanation for the tension that may arise between <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> and <b>the</b> financing firm, because the latter may try to convince the former to leave the bureaucracy to a professional manager and concentrate on inventions in the firm’s lab...|$|R

5000|$|Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), {{identifying}} <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> {{of a given}} invention is theoretically {{very important}} since [...] "the right to a European patent (...) belongs to <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> or his successor in title", according to the first-to-file principle.
