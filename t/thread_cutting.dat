25|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> as {{compared}} to thread forming and rolling, is used when full thread depth is required, when the quantity is small, when the blank is not very accurate, when threading up to a shoulder is required, when threading a tapered thread, or when the material is brittle.|$|E

25|$|Threading is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a screw thread. More screw threads are produced each year than any other machine element. There are many methods of generating threads, including subtractive methods (many kinds of <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> and grinding, as detailed below); deformative or transformative methods (rolling and forming; molding and casting); additive methods (such as 3D printing); or combinations thereof.|$|E

Of course, this fact highlights the importance of the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).|$|E

30|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether there was a difference in the torque applied for securing half pins to Rancho cubes when employing these two methods; the mounting conditions were similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Five participants were asked to secure half pins on Rancho cubes using 5 grub (set) screws and 5 standard 10 -mm bolts (Fig.  1 b) in an alternating fashion to account for fatigue. They were instructed to apply as much torque as they would in clinical practice to the point they were satisfied that the half pin has been secured adequately in the Rancho cube. New Rancho cubes and screws were used on each occasion to avoid <b>threads</b> <b>cutting</b> out and altering the results. Wrenches were used to tighten the standard 10 -mm bolts and straight hex drivers for the grub screws as would be the case when done intra-operatively (Fig.  1 c).|$|R
2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> {{when the}} context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece is held in a chuck.

2500|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. [...] A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. [...] Therefore, in manual <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. [...] It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a <b>thread.</b> The single-point <b>cutting</b> tools or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult.

This alternative seems to be the use of forming taps. The experiment took place under constant cutting conditions and consisted of two parts, one of them was the production of threads into the pre-drilled through holes and the second one was the production of threads into the pre-drilled impassable holes. The result of the experiment was finding the course of the cutting moment depending on the time and the amount of wear of the examined kinds of taps when all the measured values had to be statistically processed and conclusions were then evaluated...|$|R

30|$|For many {{researchers}} in wood and forest sciences, increment borer is a preferred way of sampling {{because it can}} take wood core samples without killing the living tree.

Owing to high contact surface area and large friction forces with the wood, the increment borer needs a high torque to penetrate the wood, especially when sampling 12  mm cores.|$|R
50|$|A {{pipefitter}} is a tradesperson who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains {{and repairs}} mechanical piping systems. Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices. Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems. Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure, which requires metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and many different alloy metals fused together through precise <b>cutting,</b> <b>threading,</b> grooving (Victaulic), bending and welding. A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable water (tap water), in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere. Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded. Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.|$|R
