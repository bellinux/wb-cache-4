40|$|This study details mercury {{pollution}} {{within the}} food chain of the Mediterranean by analysing the most comprehensive mercury dataset available for biota and water measurements. In this study we computed a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for datasets in the existing mercury-related scientific literature, in on-going programs, and in past measurement campaigns. Preliminary results indicate a major lack of information, making the outcome of any assessment very uncertain. Importantly, not all marine eco-regions are (or have ever been) covered by measurement campaigns. Most lacking is information associated with the South-Eastern part of the Mediterranean, and in several eco-regions it is still impossible to reconstruct a <b>trophic</b> <b>net,</b> as the required species were not accounted for when mercury measurements were taken. The datasets also have additional temporal sampling problems, as species were often not sampled systematically (but only sporadically during any given sampling period). Moreover, datasets composed of mercury concentrations in water also suffer from similar geographic limitations, as they are concentrated in the North-Western Mediterranean. Despite these concerns, we found a very clear bioaccumulation trend in 1999, the only year where comprehensive information on both methylmercury concentrations in water and biota was available...|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, 123 species {{had been}} {{declared}} extinct in North America. In reality many species of fish, mollusks, crustaceans and amphibians are considered threatened at some level, and it is calculated that half of freshwater mussels, a third of prawns, a fourth of amphibians and a fifth of fish will have disappeared by the year 2100.Today approximately 39% of freshwater fish in the American continent are threatened to some degree, including 230 vulnerable species, 190 threatened, 280 in danger, and 61 extinct or removed from their natural habitat.¨Biological invasions are so extensive in the marine environment that only 16% of the marine eco-regions of the world have no report of invasive species¨ (Molnar et al., 2008). The ecological impacts depend on the type of species, the magnitude of the invasion, and the vulnerability of the invaded ecosystem (Ciruna et al., 2004). Loss and degradation of biodiversity can occur from a genetic level to a systemic one, causing alterations to habitats, fundamental ecological properties of the ecosystem, chemical characteristics of the water, biogeochemical processes, and <b>trophic</b> <b>nets.</b> These impacts vary in the time lapse between the initial introduction and the subsequent dispersion of the invasive species, the severity of the impact, feasibility of synergistic interactions with other threatening processes and the potential for starting a cascade of ramifications in the whole ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effect of aquaculture activity on the marine environment in a semi - enclosed bay at NE Aegean Sea, {{for the first time}} in scientific literature. The study was divided in three major thematic parts concerning structure and dynamics of macrobenthic communities, structure and dynamics of species <b>trophic</b> <b>net</b> and species geographic range size affinity as well as species biodiversity (a-,b-,γ- diversity, functional diversity) correspondingly. In this concept, the first thematic part included the investigation of benthic macrofauna response to the established environmental gradient, induced by the presence of an aquaculture unit, in a spatio-temporal scale. Spatial extent of aquaculture impacts on the marine environment was also detected whereas factors governing the magnitude of the impacts were also examined. The <b>trophic</b> <b>net</b> which is formed by benthic organisms was considered at the second thematic part as well as predators’ response to the environmental gradient. Concerning species zoogeography, variation of species geographical range size towards the environmental gradient was examined. A new methodology was also proposed concerning the assessment of environmental impacts in cases of disturbance which is based on species feeding and zoogeographical attributes. The third thematic part of this study targets to the investigation of macrobenthic biodiversity patterns (a-,b-,γ- diversity, Functional diversity) across the established environmental gradient by means of various diversity indices and theoretical approaches. The main results which occurred from this study revealed a severe modification of benthic communities’ structure and dynamics towards the most disturbed areas of the environmental gradient. Negative impacts of aquaculture activity were found to be restricted in a distance of fifty meters from the fish cages especially during summer and autumn. However, the environmental disturbance which was detected in the study area should not be attributed exclusively to the aquaculture activity. It was evident that the study area consist a deposit basin for the polluted sediments which are located in the central part of Gera’s Bay and which are arriving in the study area through the sediment transport paths of the Bay. Furthermore, endemic (local) species populations seemed to be gradually replaced by the more resilient populations of Boreal and Atlanto-Mediterranean species with increasing disturbance levels. The use of species feeding habits and species dispersal ability as indicators of disturbance effects proved to be a robust impact assessment technique since it was able to distinguish areas subjected to different levels of environmental stress in the study area. Investigation of diversity patterns in the study area revealed that the commonly used diversity indices weren’t sufficient for the comparison of the biocommunities. Macrobenthic functional diversity seemed to decline linearly with disturbance levels due to the loss of certain functionally important species across the environmental gradient. Rare species, which their vast majority was species with low dispersal ability and resistance, were found to vanish faster than other species and consequently to modify functional diversity levels in the study area. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the population histories of three insular realms (Gargano palaeo-archipelago, Sardinia–Maritime Tuscany palaeobioprovince and the Sicilian insular complex) during the Late Miocene and Quaternary are here presented. The complexity of biodiversity changes in the islands is analysed to propose an interpretation of origination and extinction patterns. The study highlighted several important aspects of insular faunas. Evolutionary radiations were found to contribute significantly only to the Gargano faunal diversity, likely because the area was an archipelago at the time. Another interesting result is that large and small mammals do not disperse and become extinct {{all at the same}} time on each island. In fact, because of their distinct body sizes, large and small mammals have different dispersal ability and therefore different chances to cross-filtering barriers. But distinct body sizes means also different influence on diversity, resistance to environmental changes and likelihood of extinction. Another important point is that large mammalian carnivores at the top of the <b>trophic</b> <b>net</b> are quite more fragile and susceptible to become extinct than other predators. The study finally shows the clear influence that the intense Middle and Late Pleistocene climate-driven environmental changes had on island communities. The reconstruction of the faunal histories of Sardinia and Sicily shows that without exchanges with the mainland the island system represents a rather stable refuge area not too affected by the changes in the ‘‘physical’’ parameters of the environment. In contrast, if the island is frequently connected with the continent, insular faunal assemblages tend to behave as their mainland counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{molluscs}} {{serve as}} test {{objects in the}} ecological monitoring of the environment, because {{they are able to}} extract in indicator quantity from the environment and accumulate in their bodies radionuclides, various macro- and micronutrients, toxic substances of inorganic and organic origin, and so on. The gastropods are a taxonomically diverse, ecologically plastic and rather widespread group of aquatic organisms, whose role in the life of freshwater ecosystems is very important. Molluscs often have various interactions in biogeocenoses that determines their <b>trophic</b> <b>net.</b> As a rule, these interactions occur in the form of ectocommensalism, endocommensalism, supercrescence, predation or parasitism. The latter type of interaction is the subject of many studies, but the epibionts of gastropods and bivalves have practically not been studied and this research is an effort towards filling this gap. Species composition of algal epibionts identifies specific sensitivity to the effects of certain environmental factors and reflects the processes occurring in their ecosystem water bodies. This determines their efficient use for analyzing changes of water bodies as aquatic habitat, particularly in terms of complex anthropogenic pressure on aquatic ecosystems. The aim of the research was to determine the ecological characteristics of algal communities on gastropod shells: Lymnaea stagnalis, L. auricularia and Viviparus viviparus (the Uzh river, Korosten district, Zhytomyr region). Identified microalgae communities were grouped and studied according to such indices as: confinedness to the habitat (substrate), temperature, fluidity and water oxygenating, saprobiological characteristics according to the Pantle-Buck system in the modification of Sladecek and Watanabe, salinity according to Kolbe’s system, pH at Hustedt scale in the interpretation of M. M. Davydova and geographical limitations of the objects of study. Algal fouling on the shells L. stagnalis, L. auricularia and V. viviparous is formed by benthic and benthic-planktonic species. Algal epibionts of the studied communities are mainly confined to slow-flowing waters. The basis of a floristic list according to the temperature in all studied groups of gastropods is formed by indifferent species. According to geographical distribution of fouling algae, cosmopolitan species dominated. In relation to salinity according to Kolbe’s system, most species discovered were indifferent oligo-galob. Algal communities are reliable indicators of one of the important indices of watercourse hydrochemical conditions – pH of water. Analysis of algal epibionts on gastropod shells of the river Uzh, showed the dominance of alkaliphiles and indifferent species (from the number of identified microalgae). According to saprobiological characteristic of water quality of the river Uzh there was a predominance of o-saprobes. Analysis of indicator groups showed that the most numerous algal epibionts on shells were euresaprobe species. A detailed ecological and geographical characteristic of algae fouling on shells of the studied groups of molluscs allows one to predict the state of hydrocenoses, which is an important aspect of monitoring. Further research is required to model the influence of anthropogenic factors on the state of water bodies...|$|E

In order to describe the relationship between environmental parameters and ichthyofauna, this study evaluated fish assemblages composition, distribution, abundance, density, biomass, richness species, diversity and equitability in the wetlands. Sampling considered three different sites and climatic seasons (dry, rainy and cold fronts). The physical and chemical parameters considered were dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, water transparency and the depth. Fishes were caught with a shrimp net, after six minutes towings and were identified afterwards. A total of 1 049 organisms of 25 fish species were caught, two of which were exotic species: Oreochromis niloticus and Parachromis managuense. A total of 23 species were found at site I (with the highest density 0. 23 ind. /m 2), 17 at site II (0. 23 ind. /m 2) and 14 at site III (0. 12 ind. /m 2). The dry season had the highest species number with 21 species, followed by the rainy season with 17 species, and the cold season with five species. Similarly, the highest biomass (8. 30 g/m 2) was found in dry season, followed by the rainy (2. 16 g/m 2) and the cold seasons (0. 03 g/m 2). Considering seasons, highest density was found during the dry (0. 436 ind. /m 2), followed by the rainy (0. 213 ind. /m 2) and the cold (0. 023 ind. /m 2) seasons. The dominant density species during the study period, according to the quadrants graphic of Olmstead-Tukey were: Petenia splendida, Vieja heterospila, Vieja synspila, Dorosoma petenense and Astyanax aeneus. There were {{significant differences in the}} species richness among sites. Temperature, depth and transparency showed differences among the seasons. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated that fish distribution was governed by environmental parameters during all seasons. In terms of fish abundance and composition, environmental parameters play an important role showing spatial and temporal differences in the ecosystem, this could be explained with {{the fact that most of}} young fishes have a movement behavior to the wetlands, searching refuge and feed during the dry season. Considering the diversity indexes variation, it may be concluded that San Pedro River?s wetlands correspond to a system where the ichthyofauna composition fluctuates spatial and seasonally...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study on}} the presence of nine organotin compounds (OT) in a freshwater foodweb was made, using newly developed analytical procedures in order to obtain insight in accumulation and degradation processes. Tributyltin (TBT), Triphenyltin (TPT) and their degradation products were detected. Zebra mussels, eel, roach, bream, pike, perch, and pike perch and cormorant showed high OT body concentrations. At the lower trophic levels, phenyltin concentrations were higher in benthic species while butyltin concentrations were higher in pelagic species. This indicates that TBT is passed on primarily via the water, while TPT is passed on to a larger extent via the sediment. At the higher <b>trophic</b> levels, <b>net</b> bioaccumulation of TPT was greater than that of TBT, resulting in relatively higher TPT concentrations. High concentrations of biodegradation products of TBT, but not of TPT, were found in the livers of fish and birds, which indicates that TBT is more easily metabolized than TPT. A comparison with literature data of fish lethal body concentrations revealed that fish in the field may be endangered. With birds, the highest concentrations of OT were present in liver and kidney and not in subcutaneous fat, which confirms that OTs accumulate via different mechanisms than traditional lipophilic compounds. As a whole the OT concentrations found in the foodweb may be considered to be quite alarming...|$|R

Using this device, the fine-scale distribution of the key herbivorous copepods Calanus glacialis and C. hyperboreus {{as well as that}} of the omnivore Metridia longa was analyzed. It was investigated how the fine-scale vertical distribution of copepods was coupled to fluorescence of microalgae during the phytoplankton bloom and how that pattern differed between eastern and western North Water Polynya. Eastern and western NOW showed substantial differences in the fluorescence of microalgae which seemed to influence the fine-scale copepod distribution. Whereas copepod abundance and fluorescence seemed almost vertically separated on the Canadian side of the polynya, the abundance of the same taxa showed a strong vertical coupling with fluorescence on the Greenland side. The results suggest a strong influence of physical parameters in the NOW (e. g. temperature and upwelling), likely governed by the West Greenland Current and Baffin Island Current, on microalgae and hence fine-scale zooplankton distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Free-living {{nematodes}} inhabiting the sediments of the Breitenbach stream {{were investigated}} from 1992 until 1995. The Breitenbach is a submontaneous 1 st-order stream in Eastern Hesse, Germany. The study aimed to generate {{an inventory of}} free-living nematode species, determining their abundance, {{the composition of the}} communities and their fluctuation in space and time in relation to selected biotic and abiotic environmental variables. Furthermore data on the number of generations per year, biomass and production were required to allow a comparison with the respective data of other organism groups in the Breitenbach {{as well as with the}} corresponding literature data from different aquatic communities. The investigated sediment generally ranged between sand and fine gravel, the organic matter content ranged between 0. 27 and 6. 7 % of fresh sediment weight, and the discharge ranged between 2 and 386 L/sec in the period of the study. With all tested extraction methods the presence of fine detritus in the extracts proved to impede recovery of the nematodes. For the Breitenbach sediment, the most suitable method was a flotation technique using diluted Ludox® as the extraction medium. When an aqueous magnesium sulphate solution was used as the medium, only one third to half of the nematode abundance was recovered compared to Ludox®. Furthermore some samples were processed repeatedly, again using Ludox® as the extraction agent. The first run recovered only between 48 % and 82 % of those numbers obtained from four runs, indicating that the extraction method is not rigorously quantitative even when the most efficient extraction agent is used. Using the available identification keys, the majority of adult Monhysterida proved to be indeterminable. The dominant species was new to science, Eumonhystera breitenbachi n. sp. Even with specimens that apparently belonged to known species, the identification process was cumbersome and prone to errors, particularly since there are both inconsistencies within the keys and disagreements between different keys. In order to obtain more reliable and reproducible identification results, a computerized polytomous identification system was developed as an Excel macro that was linked to the digitising tablet and the microscope. This allowed instant comparison of all measured morphometric parameters with literature data. This system was extended by an Index-System, assuming unimodal distribution of morphometric characters, which enables the user to examine complete data bases automatically. The Breitenbach sediments were inhabited by an abundant and diverse nematode community. 241 taxa were recorded; of these 53 were generally aquatic species, another 98 species are considered to be amphibious and the rest of 90 species are classified as terrestrial. However, the steady and dominant species generally were the aquatic ones. The average abundance was determined to be 51 Individuals per millilitre sediment (3 – 787 ind. /mL), corresponding to a density of ca 2. 55 * 10 6 /m 2. Abundances could vary between replicates by an order of magnitude. No clear seasonality could be detected, but there were consistent differences between sampling areas along the stream. Summarizing abundance data are displayed in tables and for the important species also in charts. Abundances were affected by a winter flood event in the lower reach, less distinctly in the central and upper reach. However, composition of the nematode community changed in all three sampling areas, particularly the abundance and contribution of monhysterids decreased after the flood, whereas the populations of large Triplonchida and Enoplida remained more stable and hence their relative contribution increased. These changes partly coincided with distinct changes in the abiotic sediment parameters. Ordination analysis revealed patterns in the community and allowed both the effects to be visualized and the influence of measured environmental variables to be quantified. 34 to 60 % of the total variance could be captured in the first four axes (indirect methods). When latent variables were constrained to linear combinations of measured environmental variables (direct, constrained method) 17 to 30 % of the total variance was captured as species-environment interaction (and used in the model) whereas 29 to 41 % of the variance was allotted to the covariable sampling date. These results that were in part highly significant show that there are links between abiotic parameters and the composition of the community, but also that there must be further environmental variables that have an effect on the nematode community but that were not measured. From the environmental variables that were measured the sediment grain size (median) showed the strongest link with the latent variables, followed by water content and content of organic matter. Also the amount of very fine mineral particles (less than 5 μm) and the microbial activity in the sediment had effects on the composition of the nematode community, however these links were less pronounced than expected. R-strategic bacterial feeders dominated in the Breitenbach in terms of abundance, whereas in terms of biomass larger and K-strategic species were dominant. Generation times ranged between 23 and 365 days, some longer ones were directly observed but the majority was allometrically estimated. This corresponds to 1 – 17 generations per year, although the upper margin of this range contains considerable uncertainty. Nematode biomass (standing stock) was approximately 0. 45 g fresh weight per square meter and the production was estimated to be 0. 6 g carbon per square-meter and year. Nematodes convert microscopic bacterial biomass into macroscopic animal tissue. It was therefore assumed that they might act as an important link between bacterial production and the production of higher trophic levels, as has been demonstrated for marine meiobenthic communities. However, the Breitenbach data on biomass and production indicate that this pathway in the <b>trophic</b> <b>net</b> of the sediment is quantitatively only of minor importance: The nematode biomass- and production values were by far too low compared to the values determined for bacterial and macrozoobenthic biomass and production; these were more than an order of magnitude higher compared to those of the nematodes. Further functions the nematodes might have in the benthic community such as generating hot spots of increased bacterial production or producing rare exoenzymes are discussed, although it was not the aim of this study to test these hypotheses. However, observations from this study indicate that links between nematodes and other biota tend to be bidirectional, i. e. nematodes can predate on ciliates, but at the same time become prey of ciliates. This type of bidirectional interaction appears not to be an exception, but the rule, and the same could apply to the majority of interactions between nematodes and other organisms. Zusammenfassung Die Nematodenfauna des Breitenbaches, eines osthessischen Mittelgebirgsbaches 1. Ordnung, wurde in den Jahren 1992 - 1995 untersucht. Ziel der Arbeit war, das Artinventar zu ermitteln, die Nematodenabundanzen quantitativ zu erfassen und die Zusammensetzung der Lebensgemeinschaft und ihre Fluktuation in Zeit und Raum in Abhängigkeit von ausgewählten abiotischen Parametern zu untersuchen. Weiterhin sollte die Biomasse bestimmt, die Generationszeiten verschiedener Taxa ermittelt und darauf basierend die Produktion abgeschätzt werden, um diese abschließend mit den Biomasse- und Produktionsdaten anderer Organismengruppen im Breitenbach sowie anderer Untersuchungen limnischer Nematoden in Beziehung setzen zu können. Das untersuchte Sediment war generell sandig bis kiesig, der Anteil organischer Substanz variierte zwischen 0, 27 und 6, 7 % des Frischgewichtes und die Wasserschüttung des Breitenbaches schwankte im Untersuchungszeitraum zwischen 2 und 386 L/Sekunde. Bei allen geprüften Extraktionsverfahren war die Menge feinpartikulärer organischer Substanz (Detritus) problematisch, welche mitextrahiert wurde. Das für die Breitenbachsedimente geeignetste Verfahren war ein Flotations-Zentrifugationsverfahren mit Ludox als Extraktionsmedium. Wurde Magnesiumsulfatlösung als Extraktionsmedium verwendet, wurde nur ein Drittel bis die Hälfte der mit Ludox® ermittelten Anzahlen erfasst. Mit Ludox® als Extraktionsmedium wurden einige Proben auch wiederholt extrahiert. Bei einem Durchgang wurden nur zwischen 48 % und 82 % der mit vier Durchgängen zu gewinnenden Individuenzahlen erfasst, d. h. auch das verwendete Verfahren mit Ludox® als Extraktionsmittel ist nicht als quantitativ im strengen Sinne zu bezeichnen. Die Mehrheit der adulten Monhysteriden war mit den publizierten Bestimmungsschlüsseln nicht bestimmbar. Die dominante Art war eine bislang unbeschriebene Art, Eumonhystera breitenbachi n. sp. Auch bei Individuen, die offensichtlich beschriebenen Arten angehören, war die Bestimmung mühsam, unter anderem weil die verwendeten Bestimmungsschlüssel nicht immer in sich nicht schlüssig sind und weil die verschiedenen Schlüssel sich teilweise widersprechen. Um die Bestimmung effektiver und nachvollziehbarer zu gestalten, wurde ein elektronischer polytomer Bestimmungsschlüssel in Form eines Excel-Makros programmiert, der mit dem Digitalisierbrett und Mikroskop verbunden einen sofortigen Vergleich gemessener morphometrischer Parameter mit Literaturdaten übernahm. In einem zweiten Schritt wurde er um ein Index-System erweitert, in dem unimodale Verteilung der bestimmungsrelevanten Merkmale angenommen wurde, und mit dessen Funktionalität auch eine automatisierte Nachbestimmung ganzer Datensätze möglich war. Der Breitenbach weist eine artenreiche Nematodengemeinschaft auf. Von insgesamt 241 nachgewiesenen Arten waren jedoch nur 53 ganz oder überwiegend limnisch, weitere 98 Arten gelten als amphibisch, die restlichen 90 Arten werden als terrestrisch eingestuft. Die bestandsbildenden und stetigen waren jedoch generell aquatische Arten. Im Mittel wurden 51 Individuen pro Milliliter Sediment erfasst (3 – 787 Ind. /ml), was einer mittleren Besiedlungsdichte von etwa 2, 55 * 10 6 /m 2 entspricht. Die Abundanzen variierten von Probe zu Probe teilweise um mehr als eine Größenordnung. Deutliche jahreszeitliche Besiedlungsmaxima konnten nicht beobachtet werden, dagegen konsistente Unterschiede zwischen den drei Probenstellen längs des Baches. Abundanzdaten in Raum und Zeit werden zusammenfassend tabellarisch und für die wichtigeren Taxa auch graphisch dargestellt. Ein winterliches Hochwasserereignis hatte nur im Unterlauf einen deutlichen Effekt auf die Gesamtabundanz. Auf die Zusammensetzung der Lebensgemeinschaft hatte das Hochwasser dagegen an allen Probenstellen Auswirkungen, insbesondere in Form von deutlichen Rückgängen der Anteile der Monhysteriden und erhöhten relativen Anteilen großer Triplonchida und Enoplida. Diese Änderungen koinzidierten teilweise mit Änderungen der abiotischen Sedimentparameter. Mit Hilfe von Ordinationsanalysen konnten Muster in der Nematodenbesiedlung zusammenfassend dargestellt und quantifiziert werden. Bei indirekten Analysen wurden zwischen 34 und 60 % der Varianz in den ersten vier Achsen erfasst. Bei Beschränkung auf die gemessenen Sedimentparameter als erklärende Umweltvariablen (direkte, eingeschränkte Analysen) wurden noch zwischen 17 und 30 % der Gesamtvarianz als Art-Umwelt-Interaktion erfasst und in das jeweilige Modell integriert, während zwischen 29 und 41 % der Varianz auf die Kovariable Probenahmetermin entfiel. Die teilweise hochsignifikanten Ergebnisse zeigten, dass es weitere unbekannte Umweltvariablen geben muss, die die Zusammensetzung der Nematodenfauna deutlich beeinflusst haben, jedoch nicht gemessen wurden. Von den gemessenen Umweltvariablen war die Korngröße am stärksten mit latenten Variablen korreliert, gefolgt von Wassergehalt und organischem Gehalt der Sedimente. Auch die Menge sehr feiner mineralischer Partikel (unter 5 μm) oder die mikrobiologische Aktivität der Sedimente hatte einen Einfluss auf die Nematodenbesiedlung, jedoch weniger eng als erwartet. Bakterienfressende Arten mit einem mehr r-strategischen Lebenstyp dominierten im Breitenbach zahlenmäßig, hinsichtlich der Biomasse hatten dagegen größere und eher K-strategische Arten eine größere Bedeutung. Die Generationszeiten – teilweise direkt beobachtet, meist jedoch allometrisch berechnet – schwankten zwischen 23 und 365 Tagen, was 1 – 17 Generationen pro Jahr entspricht. Der obere Wert dieser Spanne ist jedoch mit erheblichen Unsicherheiten behaftet und nicht gut begründet. Die mittlere Biomasse betrug etwa 0, 45 g Frischgewicht pro Quadratmeter, die Produktion etwa 0, 6 g Kohlenstoff pro Quadratmeter und Jahr. Nematoden legen bakterielle Biomasse in ihren Körpern fest, und es war daher angenommen worden, dass sie ebenso wie in marinen meiobenthischen Lebensgemeinschaften ein wichtiges Bindeglied zwischen der bakteriellen Produktion und höheren trophischen Ebenen darstellen könnten. Die Biomasse- und Produktionsdaten der Nematoden belegten jedoch, dass dieser Weg im Sediment des Breitenbachs quantitativ keine bedeutende Rolle gespielt haben konnte. Dazu waren die ermittelten Biomasse- und Produktionswerte der Nematoden zu niedrig, insbesondere im Vergleich mit der bakteriellen Produktion oder der Produktion des Makrozoobenthos des Breitenbaches, welche beide um Größenordnungen höher waren als die der Nematoden. Andere mögliche Rollen der Nematoden als Erzeuger kleinräumiger "hot-spots" mit erhöhter bakterieller Produktion sowie als Produzenten seltener Exoenzyme werden diskutiert, es war jedoch nicht Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit, diese Hypothesen zu prüfen. Die Arbeit gab jedoch Hinweise darauf, dass die Verbindungen des trophischen Netzes von und zu den Nematoden in der Regel nicht unidirektional zu sein scheinen. Als ein Beispiel: Nematoden können Ciliaten erbeuten, aber auch Beute von Ciliaten werden. Diese Bidirektionalität scheint nicht die Ausnahme, sondern die Regel zu sein und für die Mehrheit der Interaktionen zwischen Nematoden und anderen Organismentypen zu gelten...|$|E

A total of 23 species were found at site I (with the highest density 0. 23 ind. /m²), 17 at site II (0. 23 ind. /m²) and 14 at site III (0. 12 ind. /m²). The dry season had the highest species number with 21 species, followed by the rainy season with 17 species, and the cold season with five species. Similarly, the highest biomass (8. 30 g/m²) was found in dry season, followed by the rainy (2. 16 g/m²) and the cold seasons (0. 03 g/m²). Considering seasons, highest density was found during the dry (0. 436 ind. /m²), followed by the rainy (0. 213 ind. /m²) and the cold (0. 023 ind. /m²) seasons. The dominant density species during the study period, according to the quadrants graphic of Olmstead-Tukey were: Petenia splendida, Vieja heterospila, Vieja synspila, Dorosoma petenense and Astyanax aeneus. There were {{significant differences in the}} species richness among sites. Temperature, depth and transparency showed differences among the seasons. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated that fish distribution was governed by environmental parameters during all seasons. In terms of fish abundance and composition, environmental parameters play an important role showing spatial and temporal differences in the ecosystem, this could be explained with {{the fact that most of}} young fishes have a movement behavior to the wetlands, searching refuge and feed during the dry season. Considering the diversity indexes variation, it may be concluded that San Pedro River&# 8217;s wetlands correspond to a system where the ichthyofauna composition fluctuates spatial and seasonally.

40|$|Dissertação mest., Aquacultura e Pescas, Universidade do Algarve, 2007 A {{number of}} {{ecological}} indicators {{were used to}} study the impact of fishing gear on the Algarve marine ecosystem. Catch composition, species richness, diversity, mean length, trophic level, percentage of mature and optimum sized fish and percentage of megaspawners were determined for the fish catches of each gear type. Four types of static gears (gill nets, trammel nets, bottom longline and semi-pelagic longline) with different mesh sizes or hook sizes represented the small-scale fisheries and were studied using data from experimental fishing trials, while commercial catches of two trawling types, crustacean trawling and fish trawling exemplified the industrial fisheries. Different species dominated the catches of the different main gears. Gill nets were clearly differentiated by the low trophic levels. Semi-pelagic longline caught larger fish with high <b>trophic</b> levels. Trammel <b>nets</b> also had high percentage of mature individuals in the catches, but also more non-target species. The trawlers affected juveniles of many species. Larger mesh sizes caught larger individuals, though not necessarily mature. The ordination procedure revealed how gear catches are best characterized by the different indicators and catch composition. Technical interactions were apparent when some gears affected juveniles of target species of other gears. Management recommendations such as minimum legal size, closed areas, gear restrictions and modifications are provided. Fishers participation in management can be enhanced by explanations of these simple indicators. Public participation can be extremely important for supporting unpopular management measures...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a rare example of “the {{ecosystem}} approach to management” that {{has been carried out}} for the purpose of providing practical support to decision-makers in managing a Site of National Interest (SIN) where activities such as fishing, aquaculture and swimming are restricted. Benthic ecosystem functioning was assessed to verify whether {{it would be possible to}} exclude the less contaminated part from the SIN and its legislative constraints. At five macrosites subjected to diversified industrialization and anthropization, we evaluated the structural characteristics of the sediments, both heterotrophic and phototrophic communities, and the main processes of production, transformation and consumption of organic matter at seven stations, plus a reference site. Along the north-eastern boundary of the bay, the port, shipbuilding and iron foundry areas, characterized by high levels of contaminants, low macrozoobenthic diversity, major organic contents (up to 51. 1 mgC g− 1) and higher numbers of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (up to 5, 464 MPN gdry− 1), differed significantly (RANOSIM = 0. 463, p = 2. 9 %) from the other areas (stations). Oxygen consumption (− 15. 22 ± 1. 59 mgC m− 2) prevailed over primary production and the <b>trophic</b> state was <b>net</b> heterotrophic. In contrast, on the other side of the harbor (residential area/center bay), contamination levels were below the legal limits and both the microalgal and macrobenthic communities displayed higher biodiversity. Higher macrofaunal abundances (up to 753 ± 174. 7 ind. m− 2), primary production rates (up to 58. 60 ± 8. 41 mgC m− 2) and exoenzymatic activities were estimated. nMDS and SIMPROF analyses performed on benthic communities significantly separated the most contaminated stations from the other ones. Overall, by applying this holistic approach, a better environmental situation was highlighted along the southern boundary of the bay and according to these results this part of the bay could be excluded from the SIN. However, further sampling is required along a finer sampling grid in the less contaminated side of the port in order to confirm these first results. Our work is one of the first case studies where such an ecosystem approach has been applied to a port area, in order to provide practical support to decision-makers involved in the spatial planning of harbor zones...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} seasonal {{patterns of}} net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, {{as part of}} the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3. 9) to rich fen (pH 7. 2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest rates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5. 4 to − 3. 9 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < poor fen (6. 3 to − 6. 5 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < intermediate fen (10. 5 to − 7. 8 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < rich fen (14. 9 to − 8. 7 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e. g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) bogs and sedge (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO 2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1 / 3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO 2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO 2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although <b>trophic</b> status, aboveground <b>net</b> primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r 2 = 0. 63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients. Q 10 values ranged from 3. 0 to 4. 1 from bog to rich fen, but when normalized by above ground vascular plant biomass, the Q 10 for all sites was 3. 3...|$|R
