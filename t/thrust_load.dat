50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E

The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during intake strokes as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an oil scraper ring whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|E

40|$|An altitude-wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to determine the performance of Hamilton Standard 6507 A- 2 four-blade and three-blade propellers on a YP- 47 M airplane at high blade loadings and high engine powers. Characteristics of the four-blase propeller were obtained for a range of power coefficients from 0. 10 to 1. 00 at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 20, 0. 30, 0. 40. Characteristics of the three-blade propeller were obtained for a range of power coefficients from 0. 30 to 1. 00 at a free-stream Mach number of 0. 40. Results of the force measurements indicate primarily the trend of propeller efficiency for changes in power coefficient or advance-diameter ratio because no corrections for the effects of tunnel-wall constriction on the installation were applied. Slipstream surveys are presented to illustrate blade <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> distribution for certain operating conditions. Within the range of advance-diameter ratios investigated at each free-stream Mach number, the efficiency of the four-blade propeller decreased as the power coefficient was increased from 0. 10 to 1. 00. For the three-blade propeller, nearly constant maximum efficiencies were obtained for power coefficients from 0. 32 to 0. 63 at advance-diameter ratios between 1. 90 and 3. 00. In general, for conditions below the stall and critical tip Mach number, the maximum <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> shifted from the inboard sections toward the tip sections as the power coefficient was increased or as the advance-diameter ratio was decreased.

40|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are simple}} machine elements of great utility used both in simple commercial devices as in complex engineering mechanisms. Because {{of being a}} very popular machine element, {{there is a lot}} of literature on the subject. With regard to the behavior of internal loading distribution, elastic deformations at point or line contacts, and geometric parameters under loading, although there are many works describing the parameters variation models, few works show such variations in practice, even under simple static loadings. In an attempt to cover this gap some studies are being developed in parallel. Particularly in this work, a new, iterative computational procedure is introduced which calculates internal normal ball loads in statically loaded single-row, angular-contact ball bearings, subjected to a known <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> which is applied to a variable distance (lever arm or eccentricity) from the geometric bearing center line.

40|$|The {{submarine}} experiences {{longitudinal vibration}} in the propulsion shafting system {{throughout most of}} run. A transfer matrix model of the propulsion shafting system, in which the dynamic characteristics of oil film within thrust bearing are considered, is established to describe the dynamic behavior. Using hydrodynamic lubrication theory and small perturbation method, the axial stiffness and damping of oil film are deduced in great detail, followed by numerical estimation of the foundation stiffness with finite element method. Based upon these values of dynamic parameters, the Campbell diagram describing natural frequencies in terms of shafting rotating speeds is available, and {{the effect on the}} 1 st natural frequency of considerable variations in thrust bearing stiffness is next investigated. The results indicate that the amplitude of variation of the 1 st natural frequency in range of low rotating speeds is great. To reduce off-resonance response without drastic changes in propulsion shafting system architecture, the measure of moving thrust bearing backward is examined. The longitudinal vibration transmission through propulsion shafting system results in subsequent axial excitation of hull; the <b>thrust</b> <b>load</b> acting on hull is particularly concerned.
