50|$|A later {{study in}} 2011 by Scurr et al. looked at {{supported}} and unsupported breast displacement {{with the aim}} to quantify multi-directional breast displacement across varying activity levels and in varying breast support conditions. The study used 21 D cup participants and activity levels varied from treadmill walking to maximal treadmill running. Maximum displacement {{was found in the}} right breast during the unsupported condition at 15 km/h, this showed an overall displacement of 15.8 cm. Results also showed that breast displacement was reduced as breast support increased by up to 59% in an encapsulation bra versus no bra. Results also showed that there was a significant increase in breast displacement as treadmill speed increased up to 10 km/h. The results of this study concluded that at higher speeds of activity, vertical breast displacement was highest, however side-to-side and forwards-backwards movement still accounted for half of the total breast displacement. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that sports bra design should primarily concentrate on vertical displacement factors but not totally ignore other planes of motion. The study also suggested that as no evidence was found that breast support requirements change as running speed increased. Designs should look into sports-specific sports bras that will account for the individual variances of breast displacement in different sports.|$|E
30|$|The {{transport}} {{phenomena in}} semiconductors {{in the direction}} perpendicular to the layers, also known as vertical transport, have been investigated in recent years from both experimental and theoretical points of view because of their increased application {{in the development of}} electro-optical devices, lasers, and photodetectors [1 – 3]. The theoretical decsription of the electron transport phenomena in several quantized systems, such as quantum wells, quantum wires, and superlattices (SLs), has been given in earlier studies, and it is mainly based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation [4 – 6]. The use of SLs is important since increasing the dispersion relation of the minibands for carriers is possible [7]. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that different origins of the periodic electron/hole potential, which take place in the compositional SLs and in the SLs formed by selective doping, can cause different consequences, influencing the formation of the miniband structures, altering the electrical conductivity, and affecting the electron scattering [6]. However, most of those studies treat only n-type systems, and very little has been reported in the literature regarding p-type materials, including experimental results [8 – 10].|$|E

Electrolyzed Reduced Water (ERW) produced near the cathode during water electrolysis exhibits high pH, high concentration of dissolved hydrogen and an extremely negative redox potential. Several findings indicate that ERW had {{the ability of a}} scavenger free radical, which results from hydrogen molecules with a high reducing ability and may participate in the redox regulation of cellular function. We investigated the effect of ERW on H 2 O 2 -induced U 937 damage by evaluating the modulation of redox cellular state. Western blotting and spectrophotometrical analysis showed that ERW inhibited oxidative stress by restoring the antioxidant capacity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Consequently, ERW restores the ability of the glutathione reductase to supply the cell of an important endogenous antioxidant, such as GSH, reversing the inhibitory effect of H 2 O 2 on redox balance of U 937 cells. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> a reduction of cytotoxicity induced by peroxynitrite via a downregulation of the NF-κB/iNOS pathway and could be used as an antioxidant for preventive and therapeutic application. In conclusion, ERW can protect the cellular redox balance, reducing the risk of several diseases with altered cellular homeostasis such as inflammation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Balinese {{traditional}} home is one {{of traditional}} architectures in Indonesia in which it still survives up to now. The home {{as a part of}} Balinese Traditional Architecture derives from Balinese Hindu belief and their custom which have a lot of Hindu philosophy. Base on this philosophy, the house which is created as a model of human being and a model divine of macro cosmos. The aim of this is to create harmony between micro cosmos (human being) and macro cosmos (nature). Physically, the usage of body measurements in the whole building dimensions has approved of how the implementation of a model of human being is created. Another thing is of how to abstractly create the building to have a soul through using basic dimension, mantra, and ritual for permission to the holy and devil spirit. Because of this, the building becomes a really unique thing. However, an interesting question reveals in relation to green building i. e. how does a Balinese traditional home create a comfortable internal environment without resorting energy usage? The presented paper has addressed it which is approached from the building layout to the building components. From those, the home appears that it has fully accounted to respond a warm-humid zone of the tropical climate. And a comfortable internal environment can be reached maximally through the use of open air concept or courtyard pattern in the building composition, most open and small buildings, the use of non bearing wall and also the critical point is the use of natural materials with low heat storage and large air cavity. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that the Balinese home has performed itself as a green building...|$|E
40|$|Gottfried Benn {{published}} {{more than}} 400 poems during his lifetime. According to my analysis, Benn tries to reveal a mystery in his poetry - {{the mystery of the}} soul and the mystery of humanity. In his book Die literarische Moderne Silvio Vietta assigns Gottfried Benn 's poetry to the era of modern literature only by referring to the aesthetics of ugliness. This suggests that the poetry of Benn is not fully understood. Vietta himself points out, that the beginnings of nihilism already exist as early as the Age of Enlightenment. In the era of modern literature topics such as "deprivation" and "the death of God" are persistent and since then, modern man feels desolate in an empty space. This solitude in emptiness of man is indeed an important topic in the poetry of Benn, however, there can also be found a very different aspect in his poems: the union with the absolute gives rise to deep insights into the ego's self. In the ecstatic state of art-making even the ego experiences the union with the absolute. Therefore art becomes the link between the absolute and man. The artist, especially the poet, becomes the mediator of truth. It is not Benn who first introduces poems as coping with this task. According to Ludwig von Wittgenstein, philosophy can only be poetic fiction, hence thoughts can only be given a voice in a written piece of art, especially one written in verses. Julian Jaynes says, written verses are divine. In his book The Origin of Consciousness he hypothesizes that gods were the first poets. The efforts of the poets to imitate the divine poems prove their longing for the absolute. This kind of yearning becomes evident in Benn's poems and this can only originate in the soul. In my view, death, God, soul and art are highly interconnected in Benn's poetry. Yet, the soul still remains an unsolved mystery and science fails to give us an answer to this very question. This is perhaps because something so abstract to the highest degree, something, we cannot see and thus cannot understand, only receives a name: SOUL. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means,</b> the soul can only become comprehensible through metaphor. In this respect, the conceptual metaphor, according to the cognitive metaphor theory of Lakoff and Johnson, which was founded in the 80 's of the last century, is an important key to Benn's poetry - a key that opens a hidden deeply mysterious world...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs {{are among}} the most {{beautiful}} and complex of all ecosystems on Earth. Although they cover less than 1 % of the world’s oceans area, this marine ecosystem harbors a huge biodiversity and is vital to human society and industries. The foundation of coral reefs relies on the fragile mutualistic relationship between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. However, this symbiosis is highly sensitive to environmental or anthropogenic disturbances and may be disrupted, thus leading to the coral bleaching phenomenon. It has been reported that the initial steps of this process are linked to photosynthesis and the antioxidant network in Symbiodinium. However the nature of the cellular mechanisms leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species and to the disruption of the symbiosis is not completely unraveled. Therefore, this study aimed to highlight the existence of photosynthetic alternative electron flows reducing molecular oxygen and the way by which they can induces an oxidative stress, in four Symbiodinium strains belonging to three different clades. Joint measurements of oxygen evolution, PSI and PSII activities by chlorophyll a fluorescence and spectrophotometric measurements allowed us to demonstrate that photoreduction of oxygen by the so-called Mehler reaction is the main electron sink at the onset of photosynthesis and during steady state photosynthesis. When Symbiodinium cells were exposed to high light conditions, the Mehler reaction and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (water-water cycle) acted as a safety valve and drained up to 50 % of the electrons from PSII, protecting it from photoinhibition and dissipating rapidly the excess photon energy by downregulation of PSII. As long as the WWC efficiency was maintained in the chloroplasts of Symbiodinium, ROS generated as a by-product of the Mehler reaction did not significantly damage target molecules and induced an acclimatory response through up-regulation of enzymes involved in the antioxidant response (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase). Nevertheless, when cells were exposed to light stress and elevated temperature (33 °C), the WWC supported 75 % of the electrons coming from PSII. This increase generated twice more H 2 O 2 than during the treatment at 26 °C and resulted in the inactivation of target enzymes of the WWC. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that under these conditions the photoprotective functions of the WWC can no longer be maintained, thus opening the way to ROS accumulation and to the induction of coral bleaching. We found that the response to oxidative stress differed between and within Symbiodinium clades. Symbiodinium clade A was less sensitive to the chemical induced oxidative stress than the others investigated strains. These variations are most likely related to their geographic origin, their thermal history, as well as to their physiological adaptations to the local environment. They may contribute to the explanation of why coral colonies and coral species have been found to differ in their susceptibilities to bleach. However, although the antioxidant response differs to some extent, some common traits were conserved. Among them, Diatoxanthin, a xanthophyll pigment involved in the non-photochemical quenching process could also have an antioxidant function. In addition, it seems that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the antioxidant response by eliminating carbonylated protein...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{rationale}} {{for this study}} was developed from the personal and professional experience of the researcher living in a Muslim community in Nigeria where HIV/STIs are major health and social care problems. Most literature reviews on HIV/STIs and polygamy in Nigeria and in sub-Saharan Africa, have focused mainly on case studies and surveys. Aim This study explores the experience and impact of HIV/STIs on Muslim women living in polygamous marriages in Nigeria. The objectives of this study are to explore their perceptions, knowledge and awareness of HIV/STIs, examine the effect of polygamy and identify factors to empower Muslim women to protect themselves. Method The study adopts a qualitative approach, consisting of one-to-one in-depth interviews, within a feminist framework, with 20 women living in polygamous marriages in Nigeria. The qualitative approach was valuable because the words of the women who live in polygamous relationships cannot be quantified. A narrative, descriptive approach to the one-to-one in-depth interviews helped the researcher to listen and to describe their perspective; this was necessary because it is about their lived experience in polygamy. Using feminism, as the theoretical framework, offers an understanding of how polygamous women can be understood in relation to the dominant ideologies existing within a particular socio structure and it provides the lens to review the situation and suggest the necessary changes. The extract from the interview transcript was used to illustrate how the polygamous women’s accounts were explored in their own vernacular ways of speaking. Through the use of thematic analysis ten themes emerged. Findings Ten themes were initially identified and four concepts finally emerged after coding and recoding of the similarities. These are the four concepts that emerged. They are; Education, Testing, Condom usage and an Economic empowerment (ETCE) approach. This means {{that there is a need}} for education, especially sex education as well as economic empowerment. The women’s accounts in this study area highlight the problems that polygamous women frequently experience such that, they cannot negotiate their sexual needs and cannot refuse their husbands taking on additional wives, within this kind of marriage system. The knowledge systems of polygamous women were evaluated and positioned in terms of women’s subjectivity and experiential knowledge. This study reveals that polygamy creates asymmetrical positioning, such asymmetrical positioning creates unequal power positions, not only among spouses, but among the co-wives within the polygamous marriage. The ways in which these social relations are negotiated and experienced are shaped by religion and traditions. This study also reveals that power and gender issues are critical factors in disempowering polygamous women, as they appear to be voiceless on issues that affect them in their polygamous marriage. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that there is a need for sexual education and for an improvement in the socio-economic status of women. Conclusions Power and gender issues are critical factors in subordinating and disempowering polygamous women in their community; they are voiceless on their reproductive rights and limited in their option to control the spread of HIV/STIs. This study therefore, calls upon policy makers in Nigeria to consider these four concepts of Education, Testing, Condom Use and Economic empowerment (ETCE), as identified in the study, to help enhance the issue of economic empowerment of the polygamous women. Also this is to say that a window of opportunity exists; planners should develop partnerships with religious and community leaders to change the detrimental behaviours of polygamous men and women on issues of prevention and the control of HIV/STIs...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{with the}} switch to the new {{generation}} adaptive optics systems like the VLT and ELT an important identification problem emerged. These telescopes are so-called integrated systems, which means that open-loop calibration of the interaction matrix is not possible anymore. The first and foremost {{reason for this is}} that the new generation of integrated adaptive optics (AO) systems are much more sensitive to external factors like gravity causing misregistrations and system parameter changes. This sensitivity is due to the integrated design, because each time that the telescope will change from operation setup, such misregistrations will be created. Unfortunately, this can lead to performance loss or closed-loop instability very fast. Even misregistrations as big as 10 % of a subaperture of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor lead to significant performance loss. For this reason, the identification and thereby correction for parameter changes in the deformable mirror (DM) have to be done during operation. Since the identification needs to be done during operation, it becomes much more important to have an identification method that does not disturb the closed-loop operation of the plant. Therefore, in this thesis, we will focus on a least cost method, preferably even a costless method for identification purposes. Since the concept of integrated AO systems with a deformable secondary mirror (DSM) is still relatively new, there has been only one serious proposal for the solution of the problem by Béchet and Kolb. They falsely claim to have developed a non-parametric costless method, i. e. a method without excitation, for the calibration of the IM and achieved ”reasonable” results. In our work, we will first of all prove why their method is fundamentally wrong. Furthermore, we will also prove that their approach will result in the identification of the inverse controller instead of the plant. This is probably also the reason why they falsely suppose to have achieved ”reasonable” results, because the dc gain of the inverse controller resembles the plant itself, which we will show as well. After explanation and comparison of several methods, we will propose the recently developed least cost identification paradigm as the best solution. This paradigm is a framework for parametric prediction error identification and is meant to minimize the impact of the experiment on the underlying system in terms of experiment duration, distortion of the closed-loop operation, power of the input signal or a combination of these, while at the same time guaranteeing a predefined level of accuracy. Different bottlenecks that need to be overcome to apply this method will be taken into account in order to adapt the least cost identification paradigm for the calibration of the interaction matrix (IM). Using the expression for the information matrix we will first of all derive and proof that, theoretically, and if the experiment duration time allows, unlimited accuracy is achievable with zero cost in closed-loop using the excitation coming from the disturbance. Furthermore, we will prove in our study that, when the cost is solely defined as the impact of the excitation signal on the normal closed-loop operation, the information-to-cost ratio per frequency is inversely proportional with the squared magnitude of the disturbance H(ω), i. e. proportional with 1 /|H(ω) |². <b>Therefore,</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that in our specific case, in which we try to find the static gain matrix for an underdamped second order resonance system with a low frequency disturbance originating from atmospheric turbulence, the Nyquist frequency will always be the optimal excitation frequency.

40|$|This {{document}} {{consists of}} three sections, {{and they are the}} academic paper (section 1), literature review (section 2) and research methodology (section 3). The academic paper consists of the purpose of the research, the summarised literature review, summarised research methodology and the research findings. The literature review section is a detailed review of literature used in this study. The research methodology section explains the research methodology and design which was employed in this study and it gives more details than the summarised version of the academic paper section. This summary integrated all the elements of section 1, section 2 and section 3. The purpose of this research is to identify the main problems that the Department of Environment and Nature Conservation (DENC) could encounter during the implementation and use of a performance management system, based on employee perspectives. The objectives of this research are therefore: to establish how often a particular problem has been encountered during the implementation and use of a performance management system in DENC; to identify the impact of various problems on the implementation of a performance management system, to establish whether these problems can be easily solved or not, and to analyse the problems associated with the implementation of a performance management system, as well as making recommendations for the successful implementation of a performance management system in the future. In this study, the researcher employed both quantitative and qualitative research approaches, informed by post-positivism as research orientation. The data collection techniques employed in this research include survey questionnaires and individual interviews. The survey questionnaire was answered by fifty respondents, and interview questions were answered by four respondents. The ethical issues were addressed by writing a letter to the Head of Department and getting authorisation to complete the research and informing respondents of their right to withdraw and to participate voluntarily. The findings indicate that the problems are either sometimes encountered or rarely encountered, and the division is about fifty percent of those sometimes encountered to those rarely encountered. This research indicates that most of the problems have a moderate impact on the use and implementation of a performance management system. The lack of management has a high impact, and a lack of positive attitude to performance management system (PMS) certainly has an impact on the use and implementation of the performance management system. Items such as the problem of information and communication technology (ICT) which does not support PMS adequately, and defining too many key performance indicators (KPI), have a small impact on the use and implementation of the performance management system. There are three problems which are difficult to solve and they are: lack of management commitment, organisational members‟ lack of positive attitude to the PMS and an insufficient period of commitment from management to PMS. This research indicates that most of the problems associated with PMS are moderately easy to solve. Two other problems that are easy to solve include the problem where there are too many KPIs defined and the problem where there is no organisational member appointed to take ownership of the PMS. According to this research, the top ten ranking problems have high ranking scores and this indicates that they can create major difficulties for the DENC in implementing the performance management system, and the chance of encountering these problems is high in the DENC in comparison to other problems. Almost all the problems ranked in the top ten seem to score highly in terms of the severity of their impact, and <b>therefore</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> that these are the problems which have an impact and, when they are not easily solved, they can become a tenacious issue for the organisation. ...|$|E

[...] Indeed, Himmler also declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind for an alien race.

A contemporary statement of this idea is that: [...] "Since God is not a being, he is <b>therefore</b> not intelligible... <b>This</b> <b>means</b> not only that we cannot understand him, but also that he cannot understand himself. Creation is a kind of divine effort by God to understand himself, to see himself in a mirror." ...|$|R
