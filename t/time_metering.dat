In smart grid scenario, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems start using real <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> information. Lebesgue- based method achieves higher data compression rates than the Shannon-based approach by encoding facts in the Mutual Information (MI) or inter-sampling.

The Rate Of Information (RoI) can be derived from the information left in clear form. It can disclose periods of higher vulnerability of smart grid. In turn, undesirable exploits could be set up.

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} costs of flight operations and {{the requirement for}} increased fuel conservation have made it necessary to develop more efficient ways to operate airplanes and to control air traffic for arrivals and departures to the terminal area. One concept of controlling arrival traffic through <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> has been jointly studied and evaluated by NASA and ONERA/CERT in piloted simulation tests. From time errors attained at checkpoints, airspeed and heading commands issued by air traffic control were computed by a time-guidance algorithm for the pilot to follow that would cause the airplane to cross a metering fix at a preassigned time. These tests resulted in the simulated airplane crossing a metering fix with a mean time error of 1. 0 sec and {{a standard deviation of}} 16. 7 sec when the time-metering algorithm was used. With mismodeled winds representing the unknown in wind-aloft forecasts and modeling form, the mean time error attained when crossing the metering fix was increased and the standard deviation remained approximately the same. The subject pilots reported that the airspeed and heading commands computed in the guidance concept were easy to follow and did not increase their work load above normal levels...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy sector}} will undergo {{fundamental}} changes {{over the next}} ten years. Prices for fossil energy resources are continuously increasing, there is an urgent need to reduce CO 2 emissions, and the United States and European Union are strongly motivated to become more independent from foreign energy imports. These factors will lead to installation of large numbers of distributed renewable energy generators, which are often intermittent in nature. This trend conflicts with the current power grid control infrastructure and strategies, where a few centralized control centers manage a limited number of large power plants such that their output meets the energy demands in real time. As the proportion of distributed and intermittent generation capacity increases, this task becomes much harder, especially as the local and regional distribution grids where renewable energy generators are usually installed are currently virtually unmanaged, lack real <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> and are not built to cope with power flow inversions (yet). All this is about to change, and so the control strategies must be adapted accordingly. While the hierarchical command-and-control approach served well in a world with a few large scale generation facilities and many small consumers, a more flexible, decentralized, and selforganizing control infrastructure will have to be developed that can be actively managed t...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{transition}} to renewable energy sources will lead to installation {{of large numbers of}} distributed renewable energy generators, which typically produce power intermittently. This trend conflicts with current power grid control strategies, where a few centralized control centers manage a limited number of large power plants such that their output meets the energy demands in real time. As the proportion of distributed and intermittent power production capacity increases, this task becomes much harder, especially as the local and regional distribution grids where renewable energy producers are usually installed are currently virtually unmanaged, lack real <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> and in many cases are not built to cope with power flow inversions. A more flexible, decentralized, and self-organizing control infrastructure must be developed that can be actively managed to balance both the large grid as a whole, as well as the many lower voltage sub-grids. One candidate for this control infrastructure is energy markets at the retail level. To help mitigate the risk of instituting such markets in the real world, we are developing a competitive market simulation testbed that will stimulate research and development of market structures along with software agents that can support decision making in these markets. Participants in the competition will design intelligent agents that will act as brokers, building portfolios of energy producers and consumers, and matching energy supply from producers with energy demand from consumers. The competition will closely model reality by bootstrapping the simulation environment with real historic load, generation, and weather data. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOver {{a period}} {{spanning}} more than 30 years, several ramp metering algorithms {{have been developed}} to improve the operation of freeways. Many of these algorithms were deployed in several regions of the world, and field evaluations have shown their significance to improve traffic conditions on freeways and ramps. Previous reviews of ramp metering algorithms focused more on the research outcomes and evaluations of traditional metering algorithms developed in the early stage of ramp metering research. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to cover the more recent developments in ramp metering in relation to the traditional metering strategies. Several local and coordinated ramp metering algorithms were reviewed. In summary, Asservissement Linéaire d’Entrée Autoroutière (ALINEA) was found to be the most widely deployed local ramp metering strategy. The algorithm is simple and implementation costs less than other strategies. It also guarantees the targeted performance goals provided that the on-ramp has sufficient storage. Several extensions were proposed in the literature to fine-tune its performance. Among the coordinated metering strategies, zone based metering is simple to implement and easy to re-configure. System-wide adaptive ramp metering (SWARM) algorithm is more sensitive to calibrate for accurate prediction of traffic states. Heuristic ramp-metering coordination (HERO) algorithm can be useful if both local and coordinated control are desired particularly if the local control is using ALINEA. Fuzzy logic based algorithms are gaining popularity because of the simplicity and the fast re-configuration capability. Advanced real <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> system (ARMS) seems theoretically promising because of its proactive nature to prevent congestion; however, its performance is highly dependent upon accurate predictions. Finally, some guidelines were proposed for future research to develop new proposals and to extend the existing algorithms for guaranteed performance solutions...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a novel implementation of Time and Energy Managed Operations (TEMO) {{in which the}} dynamic scheduling of high-lift devices (flaps/slats) and landing gear deployment is used {{in order to reduce}} fuel consumption and speed brakes usage while achieving accurate Required Time of Arrivals (RTAs) at the landing runway threshold. Two solutions are proposed: one resolving time and energy deviations with strategic re-planning of the high-lift devices and/or gear deployment; and another one solving energy deviations strategically but nullifying time errors continuously with a tactical aircraft configuration controller. The performance of both implementations has been assessed during this project. Three meteorological scenarios have been considered: International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), real atmosphere without wind prediction errors and real atmosphere including wind errors. 6 different RTAs have been tested for the ISA case while 5 for the other two weather scenarios. All these scenarios have been tested for both mentioned solutions and the baseline case. Moreover, three different "time to next configuration" (0, 30 and 60 seconds) have been simulated both in the tactical and strategic solution leading to a total of 112 different simulations. Results demonstrate that fuel consumption and speed brakes usage are reduced in all the studied weather scenarios when using dynamic scheduling of flaps/slats and landing gear. The tactical solution also shows better <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> during the entire flight descent. Moreover, it has been observed that less unable re-plans are produced and a wider margin of feasible RTAs is obtained with the new implementations. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} to achieve more accurate RTAs at the runway and increase the stabilization altitude, the performance of the aircraft engines should be better modeled to take into account their dynamics...|$|E

40|$|The {{opportunities}} for retail electricity competition to provide new value-added services to retail electricity consumers are discussed. The physical attributes of electricity supply make {{many of the}} traditional "convenience services" provided by retailers in other industries irrelevant in electricity. In addition, these attributes provide a low-cost way for electricity consumers to buy directly in the wholesale market. In this way, retail consumers can receive the commodity price related benefits of competitive generation markets without incurring large increases in advertising, promotion and customer service costs. Electric distribution companies (UDCs) can easily provide a Basic Electricity Service (BES) {{that makes it possible}} for all consumers to buy commodity electricity in competitive wholesale electricity markets at the spot market price. The availability of BES is especially important for residential and small commercial customers for whom few new retail value-added services are evident. BES also provides an excellent competitive benchmark against which consumers can compare the value added associated with competitive supply offers from competing Electricity Service Providers (ESPs), helps to protect residential and small commercial customers from exploitation by ESPs, and mitigates wasteful expenditures on marketing and promotion by rent-seeking ESPs that will increase prices. (cont.) The availability of BES helps to channel ESP competitive efforts toward providing value added services such as real <b>time</b> <b>metering</b> and control, energy management contracts, risk hedging and forward contracting, green power and other services. This is the strategy that the most successful ESPs are pursuing. A successful retail competition program can have additional social benefits by helping to improve the performance of wholesale markets. However, efforts to use creamy "shopping credits" to subsidize ESPs are misguided, raising both efficiency and equity concerns. The success of retail competition should be judged by the new value added services it brings to the system, not by the number of customers who switch to ESPs from BES and similar default services. Regulators who focus on retail switching statistics and who are subsidizing customer switching are likely to be making residential consumers worse off than they would be if BES had been made available to them by their UDC.

40|$|We analyze {{a number}} of unstudied aspects of retail {{electricity}} competition. We first explore the implications of load profiling of consumers whose traditional meters do not allow for measurement of their real time consumption, when consumers are homogeneous up to a scaling factor. In general, the combination of retail competition and load profiling does not yield the second best prices given the non price responsiveness of consumers. Specifically, the competitive equilibrium {{does not support the}} Ramsey two-part tari#. By contrast, when consumers have real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> and are billed based on real time prices and consumption, retail competition yields the Ramsey prices even when consumers can only partially respond to variations in real time prices. More complex consumer heterogeneity does not lead to adverse se 1 ection and competitive screening behavior unless consumers have real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> and are not rational. We then examine the incentives competitive retailers have to install one of two types of advanced metering equipment. Competing retailers overinvest in real <b>time</b> <b>meters</b> compared to the Ramsey optimum, but the investment incentives are constrained optimal given load-profiling and retail competition. Finally, we consider the e#ects of physical limitations on the ability of system operators to cut o# individual customers. Competing retailers have no incentive to determine the aggregate value of non-interruption of consumers in the zones they serve, preferring instead to free ride on other retailers serving consumers in the same zones...|$|R

50|$|Rhythm is the {{arrangement}} of sounds and silences in <b>time.</b> <b>Meter</b> animates <b>time</b> in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 <b>time).</b> <b>Meters</b> are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place {{an emphasis on the}} first beat of each grouping.

In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the rhythm section, which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as jazz and bluegrass, double bass) and a drum kit player.|$|R
