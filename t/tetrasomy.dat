[...] Characteristic features of <b>tetrasomy</b> 18p include, but are not limited to: growth retardation, scoliosis, abnormal brain MRI, developmental delays, and strabismus.|$|E
5000|$|Dup15q {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} copy number variation (CNV) in which extra copies of certain genes {{are present in the}} genome. Two duplication types are commonly described in Dup15q syndrome, interstitial and isodicentric. Interstitial duplications are typically partial trisomies (i.e., one extra copy of each gene) and features these extra gene copies on the Chromosome 15 alongside the [...] "original" [...] copies. Isodicentric duplications are typically partial <b>tetrasomies</b> (i.e., two extra copies of each gene) and feature an extranumerary chromosome that contains the extra genes.|$|R
40|$|High hyperdiploid (51 - 67 chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{childhood}} malignancies, comprising 30 % of all pediatric B cell-precursor ALL. Its characteristic genetic feature is the nonrandom gain of chromosomes X, 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18 and 21, with individual trisomies or <b>tetrasomies</b> being seen in over 75 % of cases, but the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (n = 16) and/or whole-exome sequencing (WES) (n = 39) of diagnostic and remission samples from 51 cases of high hyperdiploid ALL to further define the genomic landscape of this malignancy. The majority of cases showed involvement of the RTK-RAS pathway and of histone modifiers. No recurrent fusion gene-forming rearrangement was found, and an analysis of mutations on trisomic chromosomes indicated that the chromosomal gains were early events, strengthening the notion that the high hyperdiploid pattern is the main driver event in this common pediatric malignancy...|$|R
40|$|One extra {{chromosome}} copy (i. e., trisomy) is {{the most}} common type of chromosome aberration in cancer cells. The mechanisms behind the generation of trisomies in tumor cells are largely unknown, although it has been suggested that dysfunction of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) leads to an accumulation of trisomies through failure to correctly segregate sister chromatids in successive cell divisions. By using Wilms tumor as a model for cancers with trisomies, we now show that trisomic cells can form even in the presence of a functional SAC through tripolar cell divisions in which sister chromatid separation proceeds in a regular fashion, but cytokinesis failure nevertheless leads to an asymmetrical segregation of chromosomes into two daughter cells. A model for the generation of trisomies by such asymmetrical cell division accurately predicted several features of clones having extra chromosomes in vivo, including the ratio between trisomies and <b>tetrasomies</b> and the observation that different trisomies found in the same tumor occupy identical proportions of cells and colocalize in tumor tissue. Our findings provide an experimentally validated model explaining how multiple trisomies can occur in tumor cells that still maintain accurate sister chromatid separation at metaphaseâ€“anaphase transition and thereby physiologically satisfy the SAC...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tetrasomy</b> 9p {{is a rare}} {{condition}} in which people have a small extra chromosome that contains two copies of part of chromosome 9, {{in addition to having}} two normal chromosome 9's as well. [...] This condition may be diagnosed by analyzing a person's blood sample since 9p is found in high concentrations in the blood. [...] Ultrasound is another tool that may be utilized to identify <b>tetrasomy</b> 9p in infants prior to birth. Prenatal ultrasound may reveal several common characteristics including: growth restriction, ventriculomegaly, cleft lip or palate, and renal anomalies.|$|E
2500|$|Polysomy {{types are}} {{categorized}} {{based on the}} number of extra chromosomes in each set, noted as a diploid (2n) with an extra chromosome of various numbers.

2500|$|Polysomic {{inheritance}} {{occurs during}} meiosis when chiasmata form between {{more than two}} homologous partners, producing [...] chromosomes. Autopolyploids may show polysomic inheritance of all the linkage groups, and their fertility may be reduced due unbalanced chromosome numbers in the gametes. [...] In tetrasomic inheritance, four copies of a linkage group rather than two (<b>tetrasomy)</b> assort two-by-two.|$|E
40|$|The WHO {{classification}} of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) {{takes into account}} chromosomal alterations. New cytogenetic techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) offer alternative methods to the classic cytogenetic banding technique. Clear cell (classic) RCC frequently show the loss of 3 p. Papillary RCC are characterized by trisomies and <b>tetrasomies</b> as well as loss of the Y chromosome. CGH analysis demonstrates that DNA copy increase is more common in type I papillary RCC compared to type II. Chromophobe RCC are characterized by losses in chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 21. Oncocytomas can be divided into cases with rearrangements in the 11 q 13 region and those with loss of chromosome 1 and the sex chromosomes. Translocations involving chromosome 3, such as t(3; 8) (p 14;q 24. 13) and t(2; 3) (q 35;q 21) have been described in familial clear cell RCC. The most recent class of RCC, seen only in men, is referred to as translocation tumors. These tumors demonstrate a tubulopapillary growth pattern and have a t(X; 1) (p 11. 2;q 21. 2) translocation. Although not required for most clinical diagnoses, CGH and FISH complement the standard histologic diagnosis of RCC and may provide a definitive diagnosis in a small number of challenging cases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{story of}} {{biotechnology}} of wine yeasts started {{a long time}} ago. The selection of yeasts from wineries for commercial purposes was developed from the 1970 s. The aim was to display satisfactory fermentation profi les and to ensure product quality. From the 1980 s, classical breeding, interspecifi c breeding and mutagenesis were applied {{for the improvement of}} existing strains. This resulted in many developments: for example, better nitrogen assimilation and fermentation kinetics were obtained by random mutagenesis (Salmon and Barre 1998). These classical approaches are still used; EMS (ethyl methyl sulfonate) mutagenesis resulted in the selection of commercial wine strain variants which produce less reduced hydrogen sulfi de due to mutations into genes encoding sulfi de reductase subunits (Cordente et al. 2009). But genomic features of wine yeasts were rapidly identifi ed as strong limitations for these approaches. Indeed, wine strains are mainly diploid, polyploid or aneuploid. They exhibit a chromosomal polymorphism (Bidenne et al. 1992). Chromosomal trisomies or <b>tetrasomies</b> result in impaired sporulation ability and in highly variable spore viability (Johnston et al. 2000). In addition, wine strains are generally homothallic, i. e., able to switch mating type when haploid, and highly heterozygous. All these features confer to wine yeast, high genome plasticity and limit the stability of lineage of variants...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{chromosome}} gain is {{the most}} common type of gross genomic abnormality observed in human tumors. It is particularly frequent in lympho-haematopoietic and embryonic neoplasms, where trisomies and <b>tetrasomies</b> are typically present together with few or no other cytogenetic imbalances, resulting in hyperdiploid chromosome numbers. Despite the high prevalence of whole chromosome gains in neoplastic cells, their mechanism of origin remains disputed. Here, 4 potential models for the generation of whole chromosome gains are reviewed: (1) loss of chromosomes from the tetraploid level, (2) sequential sister chromatid non-disjunction, (3) multipolar mitosis coupled to sister chromatid non-disjunction, and (4) multipolar mitosis coupled to incomplete cytokinesis. Each of these mechanisms may in theory result in the generation of hyperdiploid neoplastic clones, but none of them were single-handedly able to reproduce the scenario of chromosome copy number alterations in tumors when cell populations resulting from these models were simulated in silico and compared to published cytogenetic data. To develop models for the generation of whole chromosome gains further, it is critical to improve our knowledge of the principles of clonal selection in tumors and of the baseline rate of chromosome segregation errors in human cells. To illustrate this, a model combining multipolar mitosis coupled to incomplete cytokinesis with a low rate of baseline sister chromatid non-disjunction was shown readily to reproduce copy number distributions in hyperdiploid karyotypes from human tumors...|$|R
2500|$|Isodicentric 15, {{also called}} idic(15), partial <b>tetrasomy</b> 15q, or {{inverted}} duplication 15 (inv dup 15), is a chromosome abnormality {{in which a}} child is born with extra genetic material from chromosome 15. People with idic(15) are typically born with 47 chromosomes in [...] their body cells, instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome {{is made up of}} a piece of chromosome 15 that has been duplicated end-to-end like a mirror image. It is the presence of this extra genetic material that is thought to account for the symptoms seen in some people with idic(15). Individuals with idic(15) have a total of four copies of this chromosome 15 region instead of the usual two copies (1 copy each on the maternal and paternal chromosomes).|$|E

50|$|In most cases, {{affected}} individuals {{carry the}} <b>tetrasomy</b> in every cell in their bodies. However, some patients have the <b>tetrasomy</b> {{in some of}} their tissues but not in others; this {{is referred to as}} the mosaic form of the syndrome, and often results in less severe symptoms. Non-mosaic <b>tetrasomy</b> 9p is most often the result of abnormal chromosome separation during the formation of eggs or sperm. In contrast, the mosaic form is often a result of a nondisjunction event that occurs early in embryonic development. The type and number of tissues affected in the mosaic form is dependent upon the timing and location of the abnormal division within the developing embryo.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of <b>tetrasomy</b> X {{are highly}} variable, ranging from {{relatively}} mild to severe. Symptoms are often {{similar to those}} of trisomy X. Physically, <b>tetrasomy</b> X patients tend to have distinctive facial features such as epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridges, upslanting palpebral fissures, midface hypoplasia, small mouths, cleft or high arched palates, delayed or absent teeth, or enamel defects. The majority have also been reported as being longer and taller. Many also show joint and muscle tone abnormalities, including hypotonia and joint looseness in the hips. Skeletal problems may also be present, including abnormal curvatures of the spine.
