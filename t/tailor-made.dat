5|$|Jeethu had {{initially}} approached Mammootty {{to play the}} lead, but {{he was unable to}} commit and asked Jeethu to proceed with the film with another actor. According to the director, Mammootty was instrumental in casting actress Meena for the film. The director, in an interview with The New Indian Express, stated that he wrote the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was <b>tailor-made</b> for Mohanlal. He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E
5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences. His {{propensity}} to drive the ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for <b>tailor-made</b> double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career. Ripken is third on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).|$|E
5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a <b>tailor-made</b> show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an edge on the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be <b>tailor-made</b> for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with <b>tailor-made</b> offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E

25|$|Steric forces between polymer-covered {{surfaces}} or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, {{producing an}} additional steric repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive depletion force between them.

25|$|The IDF {{also has}} several large {{internal}} {{research and development}} departments, and it purchases many technologies produced by the Israeli security industries including IAI, IMI, Elbit Systems, Rafael, and dozens of smaller firms. Many of these developments have been battle-tested in Israel's numerous military engagements, making the relationship mutually beneficial, the IDF getting <b>tailor-made</b> solutions and the industries a good reputation.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibodies}} can be <b>tailor-made</b> for {{a chemical}} compound. For example, one strategy often in use is the artificial production of proteins, {{based on the}} genetic code (DNA). These proteins can then be used to immunize rabbits, forming antibodies which bind to the protein. The antibodies are then coupled chemically to a fluorophore and used to trace the proteins in the cells under study.|$|E
25|$|Principles {{that govern}} the immune {{response}} can now be used in <b>tailor-made</b> vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that {{have an impact on}} the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in 1988, {{and since then}} the company has grown and become a leading timber industry company in Saudi Arabia. The company’s factory was built in Riyadh on an area of 24,500 square meters which included various types of wood products. Another factory is specialized in producing <b>tailor-made</b> standard products such as doors, cabinets, timber blocks, roofs and other wood products. Plastic-laminated kitchen units are also designed and produced for the construction sector. Other supplementary products are also manufactured.|$|E
25|$|ND {{started working}} {{to find new}} market {{segments}} it could create <b>tailor-made</b> systems for on top of its existing product lines. The first such market was computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing, but this was largely rejected by the international sales divisions. Of fear of the company failing completely the side, projects were abandoned as was the Ndix project. 1988 became the first year since 1967 that Norsk Data {{did not make a}} profit. That year also saw the company's share equity halve.|$|E
25|$|Possessed (1947) {{had been}} <b>tailor-made</b> for Davis and {{was to have}} been her next project after Deception. However, she was {{pregnant}} and went on maternity leave. Joan Crawford played her role in Possessed and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. In 1947, at the age of 39, Davis gave birth to a daughter, Barbara Davis Sherry (known as B.D.) and later wrote in her memoir that she became absorbed in motherhood and considered ending her career. As she continued making films, however, her relationship with her daughter B.D. began to deteriorate and her popularity with audiences was steadily declining.|$|E
25|$|Aly & Fila {{celebrated the}} 200th episode of their hugely {{successful}} radio show Future Sound Of Egypt 200 by throwing {{an event in}} their native home of Egypt on December 2, 2011. Set to light up the chosen venue of Echo Temple in Sharm El Sheikh, the line-up included some of the hottest dance acts in {{the scene at the}} time, including John O’Callaghan, Roger Shah, Sied Van Riel and many others. Echo Temple is <b>tailor-made</b> for trance fans prepared to dance long into the night {{at the foot of the}} Sinai Mountains, and is widely regarded as one of the world's finest outdoor clubs because of its truly unique experience.|$|E
25|$|Male mods {{adopted a}} smooth, {{sophisticated}} look that included <b>tailor-made</b> suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, wool or cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck), Chelsea or Beatle boots, loafers, Clarks desert boots, bowling shoes, and hairstyles that imitated {{the look of}} French Nouvelle Vague film actors. A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely to stain clothes with oil or road dust. Many mods wore military parkas while driving scooters {{in order to keep}} their clothes clean.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1980s, {{the market}} shifted such that {{customers}} went away from purchasing hardware and instead wanted complete systems including software, preferably <b>tailor-made</b> for the industry. This was a disadvantage for ND, {{as they had}} their advantage in designing hardware systems. Their lack of industry-specific software was combined with that all software development was outsourced, which meant that ND's most important sales arguments were being determined by a third party. Another development was the open standards, especially Unix, which was disliked at ND. This would remove the vendor lock-in and the well-liked Notis, which was instrumental in creating profits. Management had a high pressure from investors to create high growth rates, which again caused the company to choose short-term profit margins ahead of long-term strategic positioning.|$|E
25|$|The University of Hyderabad’s Study in India Programme (SIP) {{for foreign}} {{students}} {{began as a}} small experimental summer initiative where students from the University of Pittsburgh took nine credits over nine weeks {{in the summer of}} 1998. Since then, SIP has grown in leaps and bounds and has gone from hosting eight students in its debut year to nearly 200 in the most recent academic year. The University Grants Commission (UGC), a governmental organisation in India tasked with determining and maintaining standards for university education, has hailed the Study in India Programme as a model initiative and has encouraged other universities in India to emulate the program’s approach. SIP’s strength is its flexibility and willing to innovate {{to meet the needs of}} universities and study abroad consortia. SIP has created specialised, <b>tailor-made</b> programs for partners such as Dartmouth College, Duke University and the Nordic Centre in India—a consortium of 15 Nordic universities. Students can apply on their own, through their home schools, or through study abroad consortia that are SIP partners.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall, a late developer, {{began his}} {{first-class}} cricket career in 1948, {{at a time}} when English bowling was weak because World War II had decimated their pre-war pace attack. He first played for Lancashire in 1948 as a medium fast bowler, taking 66 Second XI wickets. He did not establish himself until 1950 after Roberts, Price and Nutter had left the staff and he changed to bowling mainly off-breaks, something he developed in Minor County cricket. That year, {{largely as a result of}} groundsmen at Old Trafford deciding to eliminate watering of the pitch, Tattersall consistently had pitches <b>tailor-made</b> for him and he did not disappoint, being the leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket with 193 victims for under 14 apiece. This won him the inaugural Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year award. Although he was not risked in the Tests against a powerful West Indian batting line-up, Tattersall was chosen as a reinforcement for the 1950–51 Ashes series that winter. He did modestly in Australia, but bowled well enough on the more helpful New Zealand pitches to establish himself in the Test team for fourteen consecutive matches.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were <b>tailor-made</b> of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{know about the}} forum and have on several {{occasions}} read the comments made on it. The character Comic Book Guy is often used in the show to lampoon {{and respond to the}} newsgroups fans.

Independent commentators call the forum an example of an [...] "active audience" [...] and have claimed The Simpsons is <b>tailor-made</b> for such a forum.|$|E
500|$|As Squaw Valley was an {{undeveloped area}} {{when it was}} awarded the Olympics, the {{organizing}} committee was free to design a <b>tailor-made</b> Olympic resort.

He chose to locate it on the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, opposite Blyth Arena. He described the location as [...] "the type of hill one always seeks but seldom finds". The construction contract was awarded to Diversified Builders, who constructed the jumps {{during the summer and}} fall of 1958.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, she {{appeared}} with Akshay Kumar {{for the first}} of many films in Raj Kanwar's unsuccessful Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, a story of two like-minded strangers who fall in love despite being engaged to others.

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that [...] "You" [...] was <b>tailor-made</b> for his wife, Phil Spector opted not to issue the song as her {{comeback}} single; he had likewise held back recordings by the Ronettes and the Crystals, another act signed to his label, Philles Records, in the 1960s. With the solo-album plan abruptly abandoned, another Harrison original from the sessions, [...] "Try Some, Buy Some", was completed and selected for release as a Ronnie Spector single on Apple. A minor hit in America only, that song's disappointing commercial reception led to the cancellation of a second single, {{which was to be}} [...] "You".|$|E
500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "Who Wants Candy" [...] {{in the book}} Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons {{an example of an}} [...] "active {{audience}} ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show". He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show's qualities. Chris Turner writes in the book [...] that The Simpsons appeared <b>tailor-made</b> for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic writer K. Ross Hoffman {{declared}} the record an [...] "entirely satisfying display" [...] of Lindstrøm's talents and positively {{commented on the}} textured instrumentation. Hoffman concluded the music was an [...] "expansive, exploratory journey" [...] worth experiencing. Andy Battaglia of The A.V.
