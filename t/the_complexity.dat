30|$|We {{have also}} {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of <b>the</b> proposed methods {{with those of}} M-CLMS when M= 2, 4, 8, and D-CLMS schemes in [49]. Note that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are 3 MN+ 5 M+ 1 and 10 N+ 3 respectively and that these complexities also increase by an amount of 2 MN+ 5 M−N+ 3 when the transfer and momentum terms are implemented. In these figures, {{it can be seen}} that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of <b>the</b> M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes are advantageous comparing to the R-CMLF and D-CMLF schemes mainly due to the well known simplicity of LMS filters, and this advantage becomes larger with increasing number of combining filters (M). However, it can be also noted that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of transfer and momentum terms are comparable to those of the core M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes, and therefore, the addition of transfer and momentum terms influences <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of M-CLMS and D-CLMS schemes more noticeably.|$|R
