40|$|In Vibrio alginolyticus, the flagellar motor can rotate at {{a remarkably}} high speed, ca. {{three to four}} times faster than the Escherichia coli or Salmonella motor. Here, we found a Vibrio-specific protein, FlgT, in the {{purified}} flagellar basal body fraction. Defects of FlgT resulted in partial Fla− and Mot− phenotypes, suggesting that FlgT is involved in formation of the flagellar structure and generating flagellar rotation. Electron microscopic observation of the basal body of ΔflgT cells revealed a smaller LP ring structure compared to the wild type, and most of the <b>T</b> <b>ring</b> was lost. His 6 -tagged FlgT could be coisolated with MotY, the T-ring component, suggesting that FlgT may interact with the <b>T</b> <b>ring</b> composed of MotX and MotY. From these lines of evidence, we conclude that FlgT associates with the basal body and is responsible to form an outer ring of the LP ring, named the H ring, which can be distinguished from the LP ring formed by FlgH and FlgI.

At RT, 1, 2 shift of the eta(5) -P 3 C 2 Bu 2 <b>t</b> <b>ring</b> was only observed for compound 2. Where as 2 loses CO readily in solution to give [Ir- 4 (CO) (10) {mu-eta(1) -eta(1) -[Fe(eta(5) -P 3 C 2 Bu 2 t) (eta(5) -P 2 C 3 Bu 3 t) }] (3), activation with Me 3 NO was necessary to produce [Ir- 4 (CO) (10) {[Fe(eta(5) -P 3 C 2 Bu 2 t) (eta(5) -C 5 H 5) }] (4), obtained in the form of two non-interconverting isomers 4 a and 4 b, which were not able to be separated. A single crystal X-ray diffraction study of isomer 4 a established that the [Fe(eta(5) -P 3 C 2 Bu 2 t) (eta(5) -C 5 H 5) ] ligand bridges one of the edges of the Ir 4 tetrahedron, interacting via the lone electron pair of one of the adjacent P atoms and in an eta(2) - mode via the P-P double bond of the eta(5) -P 3 C 2 Bu 2 <b>t</b> <b>ring</b> and that all CO ligands are terminally bonded.

Next, we define a topological Morita context to be a family made up of two complete l. <b>t.</b> <b>rings</b> (R,ρ) and (S,σ), two bimodules (SAR,α) and (RBS,β) of the above kind, and two continuous bilinear maps μ:(B,β) ⊗uS(A,α) →(R,ρ) and ν:(A,α) ⊗uR(B,β) →(S,σ); the context is called dense if both μ and ν have dense image. We then prove that such a dense Morita context yields an equivalence of categories between CLT-(R,ρ) and CLT-(S,σ), in such a way to induce an equivalence between Mod-(R,ρ) and Mod-(S,σ). Finally, we give a “topological” parallel of the notion of progenerator, and we show that such a “topological progenerator” gives rise to a dense context, and hence to an equivalence of the above-mentioned kind. Conversely, we show that every such equivalence arises in this way...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considered}} 135 {{cases of}} chronic subdural haematoma following head injury in 1977 and 1978. The majority {{were in the}} older age group and more often males.

However, there was a mortality rate of 9 % and delay in diagnosis was the most likely preventable factor contributing to this. Accordingly the possibility of this complication after head injury should be known to those concerned in the later hospital treatment and follow–up management especially of older patients and alcoholics. When the diagnosis has been made, the preferred surgical method of treatment is drainage through burrholes.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of magnetization (M) reversal and relaxation {{as a function}} of temperature (T) are reported in three non-interacting NiFe ring arrays having fixed ring outer diameter and varying widths. Additionally, the dependence of M(H) loop on the angle (theta) between magnetic field (H) and the plane of the rings is addressed. The M(H) loops show a double step transition from onion state (OS) to vortex state (VS) at all temperatures (T = 3 to 300 K) and angles (theta = 0 to 90 degrees). The critical reversal fields H-C 1 (OS to VS) and H-C 2 (VS to OS) show a pronounced dependence on <b>T,</b> <b>ring</b> width, and theta.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} and dissociation {{of hydrogen}} on Zn-exchanged zeolites {{has been studied}} theoretically by density functional theory (DFT). Diverse types of active sites have been employed for the Zn cation, such as: placed on different rings (4 T and 5 T), in the (ZnO) 4 (in a cubic configuration cluster) and in the [Zn–O–Zn] 2 + dimer complex. The Zn(II) cation is most exposed to probe molecules when situated on 4 <b>T</b> <b>ring</b> of zeolites. In this position, the cation activates the infrared stretching band of the hydrogen molecule, which is not observed when Zn(II) sits on 5 T rings. The assignment of the band shifts found in the experimental IR spectra of hydrogen adsorption, which were associated to the cation position in the zeolite framework, had to be revised following {{the results for the}} calculated shifts. Larger shifts are associated to the cationic position at small rings. In the case for (ZnO) 4 the dissociative adsorption is more favorable.

This paper describes the findings for 129 patients who {{had more than one}} significant intracranial haematoma. Overall, the case fatality rate for these patients was 85 %. The presence of low or fluctuating blood pressure was associated with a significantly higher mortality than {{in the rest of the}} group. Bilateral reacting pupils or an improvement in level of consciousness following decompressive surgery carried a more favourable prognosis. There was 100 % fatality if surgery was not carried out or if the bleeding was not found at operation. A subset of patients who died was selected on the basis of a calculated prognostic variable, and compared with a similar subset of survivors. A higher proportion of patients who died had a delay in the provision of definitive treatment and failure to correct shock. This comparison was made on two criteria. Using the first accepted optimal treatment in 1984, nearly all cases were treated suboptimally, as might be expected. Using the second, acceptable treatment in 1977 – 78, it was calculated that between nine and 12 patients died with MIH in NSW in the 2 years of the survey, whose deaths might have been prevented. W.

Of these, 132 (65 %) were cervical, 60 (30 %) thoracic, eight (4 %) lumbar {{and two were}} inadequately recorded. A major concurrent injury to the head was present in every third patient, to the chest in every fourth patient, and to the limbs in every fifth patient. The outcomes of patients reported in this series make {{it one of the}} worst in the literature. Sixty-nine (34 %) patients died in hospital; of the 133 survivors, only 22 (11 %) have resumed work, the remainder being partially or totally disabled. It is estimated that another 302 patients died before arrival in hospital. In country areas, the time lags between accident and ambulance notification, and between notification and arrival at hospital, were uncertain in many cases, but periods in excess of 2 hours were recorded in 28 (14 %). One-man ambulances or private vehicles were used in at least 43 cases (21 %). After admission, 139 patients were transferred to other hospitals for definitive treatment, arriving after an average time of 22 h (median time 9 h); for such patients, the original hospital presumably served as a first aid station. A case control study suggests that preventable delay in transport, inappropriate treatment, and failure to correct shock may have been causative factors in 16 deaths in this series. Reduction of the time lag between accident and institution of definitive treatment will save lives, and may avoid some crippling neurological deficits. To achieve this, there is an urgent and overdue need to integrate ambulance and hospital services and to establish efficient multidisciplinary trauma centres. B. R. Selecki, G. Berry, B. Kwock, J. A.

In {{the first of}} these the synchrotron light load is taken at 2 K, and in the second it is intercepted on a bore liner at 4. 5 K. The possibility of staged construction of the 20 Tev, 8 T, 2 K ring with initial operation at 15 Tev, 6 T and 4. 5 K has also been considered. A set of dimensions and specifications has been developed for each of the two 8 T options in the three categories: magnets, cryostat, and refrigeration system with the object of providing for a detailed cost comparison with the 6 T, design D ring. Cost information for refrigeration systems that are not strictly comparable to design D have been developed from component quotations. A very preliminary discussion of costs is included in the report. A summary of the principal findings of the task force is as follows: the temperature at which a 6 T, 4. 5 K magnet will operate at 8 T with the same critical current safety margin is found to be 2 K; an increase of 0. 5 cm in the magnet inner diameter is found to be sufficient to accommodate a fluid-cooled bore liner; the most important change in going from the design D magnet to a magnet suitable for operation at 8 T, 2 K is an increase of about 10 % in the superconductor and 60 % in the iron per unit length; the cryostat for 2 K is fundamentally the same as for design D; for the same load ratings complete refrigeration system for the 2 K ring costs about 1. 5 times as much as a system for a 4. 5 K ring and uses twice the power; two ideas have come up in the investigations that clearly have merit and deserve further study independent of the choice of magnet style.

40|$|The {{location}} of the Zn 2 + cation in Zn-exchanged chabazite has been studied by the periodical density functional method. Chabazite was chosen as a zeolite model, because it contains three different types of rings commonly found in the zeolite structures: four-, six-, and eight-membered rings. Two aluminum atoms have been employed to substitute the silicon atoms in the same D 6 R unit cell of the zeolite framework. This leads to different arrangements for the Bronsted site pair and the Zn(II) cation. The two Bronsted sites {{are found to be}} more stable when placed in the small ring (4 <b>T</b> <b>ring)</b> than in the other rings. This suggests that the most reactive Bronsted sites are located in the large rings. Two Bronsted sites are most stable when the O(H) -Al-O-Si-O(H) -Al sequence is followed in the same ring instead of being located in two different rings. This resembles the aluminum distribution in the small four-membered ring and agrees with bond order conservation rules. The cation stability is markedly influenced by the distortions of the framework. Other factors that also contribute to the stabilization are the aluminum content near the cation and the stability of the original Bronsted sites. The Zn 2 + cation is more stable in the large rings than in the small ones, the six-membered one being the most stable configuration. In the small rings, the cation is, therefore, more reactive. Two different probe molecules have been used to study the interaction with the Zn(II) cation: water and methane. These probe molecules can extract the active center from its original position. For the water molecule, this effect is large and leads to a high framework relaxation. The value of the binding energy of this molecule to the active sites is influenced by these framework relaxations {{as well as by the}} cationic position environment. For weakly interacting methane, these effects are significantly les...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Background: Patient-oriented medicine is an emerging concept, {{encouraged by the}} World Health Organization, to greater involvement of the patient {{in the management of}} chronic diseases. The Patient-Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (PO-SCORAD) index is a self-assessment score allowing the patient to comprehensively evaluate the actual course of atopic dermatitis (AD), using subjective and objective criteria derived mainly from the SCORAD, a validated AD severity clinical assessment tool. Objectives: To validate the PO-SCORAD index in a large European population of patients exhibiting all forms of AD severity by assessing its correlation with the SCORAD index. Patients/methods: Four hundred and seventy-one patients (185 adults, 286 children) consulting for AD in hospitals from 9 European countries were recruited. The investigators and the patients used the SCORAD and PO-SCORAD scales, respectively, to assess AD severity at inclusion (D 0) and 28 ± 7 days later (D 28). Results: Patient-Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis and SCORAD scores were significantly correlated at D 0 [r = 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 62; 0. 72), P < 0. 0001]. Consistency was confirmed at D 28, with a stronger linear correlation between both scales [r = 0. 79 (95 % CI: 0. 75; 0. 83), P < 0. 0001]. Absolute changes from baseline in SCORAD and PO-SCORAD scores were also significantly correlated [r= 0. 71 (95 % CI: 0. 64; 0. 76), P < 0. 0001]. Although no specific intervention was investigated, AD improved over the study, with a decrease of PO-SCORAD and SCORAD scores from D 0 to D 28 by - 19. 19 % and - 24. 39 %, respectively. The consistency of the correlations was similar in the adult and children groups.

Whether the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction J is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, 1 /T_ 1 _ versus temperature <b>T</b> in <b>ring</b> nanomagnets may be peaked at around k_B_T=|J| provided the lifetime broadening of discrete energy levels is {{in proportion to}} T^ 3 ^. Experimental findings for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Cu^II^ rings are reproduced with crucial contributions of magnetic anisotropies as well as acoustic phonons.
