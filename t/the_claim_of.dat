5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a black metal {{influence}} in the album's imagery.

He sought to influence the committee to grant <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Alexander Hamilton's widow to wages which Hamilton had declined when serving under George Washington. Although Hamilton was a champion of the rival Federalist Party, Johnson had compassion for Hamilton's widow; before the end of his term, he secured payment of the wages.|$|E

5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K. Cleghorn and Archibald Scott Cleghorn, with a hearing set by Justice Lawrence McCully. In July 1878, Justices Harris, Judd and McCully heard Kalakaua's appeal. While the Justices felt that <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Kalakaua and his sisters {{had not been}} proven, they were impressed with that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on testimony and witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: one quarter to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); one quarter each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and one quarter to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the adjudication of his claim.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been officially}} {{suspended}} {{at the end}} of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. This parliament, later known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years. Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. James' parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689, William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under <b>the</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>of</b> Right, which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles. The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707.|$|E
5|$|In 1191 Leo {{captured}} and rebuilt Bagras, a strategically important fortress that Saladin had seized from the Knights Templar and then destroyed before abandoning it. Bohemond ordered Leo {{to return it}} to the Templars, but Leo refused, stating that his right of recent conquest was stronger that <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the Templars who had lost their property. After Bohemond failed include Cilicia in his truce with Saladin in 1192, Leo invited him to Bagras to start negotiations. Bohemond accepted the offer, but Leo had him captured, forcing him to surrender Antioch. Although the noblemen (who were closely related to Armenian nobles) were willing to accept Leo's rule, the mainly Greek and Latin townspeople formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from occupying Antioch.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
25|$|In 1663, Rhode Island {{obtained}} a patent extending its territory in certain places three {{miles east of}} Narragansett Bay. In 1664, a royal commission appointed by King Charles II <b>of</b> England denied <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts and Plymouth to land west of Narragansett Bay, granting jurisdiction to the newly unified Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (pending resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Connecticut). However, <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Plymouth to all lands east of Narragansett Bay were upheld, and so the border was set in practice.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{preserve}} Episcopalian control of the Kirk, the Scottish Bishops backed a proposal for Union between England and Scotland but this was dropped due to opposition by the English Parliament. On 11th April, with only five dissenting votes, the Convention declared James' reign in Scotland ended and adopted <b>the</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>of</b> Right Act and the Articles of Grievances. The result {{was consistent with the}} English Bill of Rights in making Parliament the primary legislative power in Scotland but then went further by reinstating Presbyterian control of the Kirk.|$|E
5|$|John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby {{maintained}} <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000marks (£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained {{possession of}} Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his {{support in the}} face of country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to hand them over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{increasingly}} {{threatened by the}} growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th and 16th centuries. Moscow indeed took over many of Lithuania's eastern possessions in military campaigns of 1471, 1492, and 1500. Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania was elected King of Poland in 1501, {{after the death of}} John Albert. In 1506, he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I Stary) in both Poland and Lithuania as political realities were drawing the two states closer together. Prior to his accession to the Polish throne, Sigismund had been a Duke of Silesia by the authority of his brother Vladislas II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he did not pursue <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> the Polish Crown to Silesia.|$|E

5|$|Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the descent into civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it was Robert who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Duke of Norfolk, {{also called}} Thomas, made far less {{use of the}} castle, using first Stoke-by-Nayland and then Kenninghall as his {{principal}} residence. Thomas was attainted in 1547 {{for his part in}} supporting <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Mary to the throne; Henry VIII died the day before Thomas was due to be executed at the Tower, and his successor, Mary's half-brother Edward VI, reprieved Thomas but kept him in the Tower, giving Framlingham to Mary. When Mary seized power in 1553 she collected her forces at Framlingham Castle before successfully marching on London. Thomas was released from the Tower by Mary as a reward for his loyalty, but retired to Kenninghall rather than Framlingham. The castle was leased out but when the 4th Duke, another Thomas, was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1572 the castle passed back to the Crown.|$|E

5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the Junkers, retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power {{to the absence of}} a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} least, archaeological {{evidence}} supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants {{were active in}} Southeast Asia, if not <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius {{have been found in}} Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman glass bowl unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era Geography that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the archaeological evidence could have been Oc Eo.
