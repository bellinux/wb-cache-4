25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>there,</b> although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> ...<b>there</b> must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|Greg Mueller from GameSpot {{recommends}} {{the game for}} its value but sees it as [...] "not an absolutely essential expansion" [...] and rates some of the later quests as repetitive and uninspired. Similar comments followed from GamePro reviewer Newton, who found that it is [...] "an impressive expansion" [...] which [...] "delivers more of what made Oblivion great: creative quests, a huge land to explore, and tons of things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>there,</b> [...] making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was {{a fan of the}} core game". Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is [...] "the same game as it ever was, only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop, and less interesting questing". Charles Onyett from IGN rates it as [...] "an entirely worthy addition to Bethesda's stellar fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series" [...] and as [...] "a great excuse to jump back in [...] ".|$|E

In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>There</b> wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E

2500|$|Abrams {{supervised}} post-production {{and editing}} {{of the film}} at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica. In August 2015, Abrams gave the estimated running time of the film as 124–125 minutes. Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: [...] "At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>there</b> of value, except to be sitting around."

[...] This angered African-Americans in the United States, prompting many black leaders to demand an apology from Fox. Reverend Al Sharpton requested a formal apology from Fox to the African-American community and called for an economic boycott of Mexican products until an apology was received. [...] Sharpton, along with many African-Americans felt that Fox's comments were insensitive and racist. Reverend Jesse Jackson, during a news conference concerning Fox's statement about African-Americans, said that he felt that the comments were, [...] "unwitting, unnecessary and inappropriate," [...] and added that [...] " [...] statement had the impact of being inciting and divisive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 American Journalist John P. Harris {{wrote an}} {{editorial}} in the Salina Journal highlighting a lack of balance in the Soviet system, which promoted an International Women's Day for the female workers without promoting a corresponding day for male workers. Harris stated that although he did not begrudge Soviet women their March day of glory, its resulting gender inequality clearly exhibited a serious flaw in the Communist system, which, [...] "makes much of the equal rights it has given the sexes, but as it turns out, the women are much more equal than the men." [...] Harris stated that while the men toiled along in their grooves doing what their government and womenfolk tell them <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>there</b> was no day when males are recognised for their service, leading Harris to conclude that [...] "This strikes me as unwarranted discrimination and rank injustice." [...] Similar questions about the inequality of observing women's day without a corresponding men's day occurred in media publications from the 1960s through to the 1990s, at which time the first attempts at inaugurating international Men's Day are recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Apocalypto {{has been}} criticized for portraying a type of human {{sacrifice}} which was more typical of the Aztecs than of the Maya. Archaeologist Lisa Lucero said, [...] "the classic Maya really didn't go in for mass sacrifice. That was the Aztecs." [...] Anthropology professor Karl Taube argued that, [...] "We know the Aztecs did that level of killing. Their accounts speak of 20,000." [...] According to the film's technical advisor, the film was meant to describe the post-classic period of the Maya when fiercer influences like the Toltecs and Aztecs arrived. According to Hansen, [...] "We know warfare was going on. The Postclassic center of Tulum is a walled city; these sites had to be in defensive positions. There was tremendous Aztec influence by this time. The Aztecs were clearly ruthless in their conquest and pursuit of sacrificial victims, a practice that spilled over into some of the Maya areas." [...] Anthropology professor Stephen Houston made the criticism that sacrifice victims {{were more likely to be}} royalty and elites rather than common forest dwellers, as shown in Apocalypto. Anthropology professor Karl Taube criticized the film's apparent depiction of widespread slavery, saying, [...] "We have no evidence of large numbers of slaves." [...] Another disputed scene, when Jaguar Paw and the rest of the captives are used as target practice, was acknowledged by the filmmakers to be invented as a plot device for igniting the chase sequence. Some anthropologists objected to the presence of a huge pit filled with rotting corpses near the fields of the Maya. Hansen states that this is [...] "conjecture", saying that [...] "all [...] trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>there</b> is express the horror of it".|$|E
2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and I did my best to put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and what he was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>there,</b> even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained {{that it was not a}} plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) and why would it take 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely shook his head and ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E
