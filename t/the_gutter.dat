5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. <b>The</b> <b>gutter</b> was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E

5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and wondered whether it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into <b>the</b> <b>gutter</b> or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of <b>the</b> <b>gutter,</b> crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E

5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in <b>the</b> <b>gutter.</b> After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E

25|$|Another {{particular}} {{feature of}} Romanesque buildings are corbel tables, a projecting moulded string course {{supported by a}} range of corbels.

As a rule corbel tables carries <b>the</b> <b>gutter,</b> but the arcaded corbel table was also used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In some buildings corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.|$|E

25|$|In this way, {{a series}} of {{ploughing}} runs down a field leaves a row of sods that lie partly in the furrows and partly on the ground lifted earlier.
