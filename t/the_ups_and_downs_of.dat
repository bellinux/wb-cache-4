5|$|Reflective of the {{documentary}} theme, Yamaguchi saw the album expressing <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> regular days, more so than previous albums.

5|$|Despite Husayn's {{rebellion}} and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and sharing in <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established {{the family as}} the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an illegitimate child contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. <b>The</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

Most of the subsequent sonnets describe <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> the relationship, culminating with an affair between the poet and the Dark Lady.

That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would {{let me have a}} baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> their relationship.|$|E

However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact [...] "that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect" [...] as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> success at a young age, Gillies says the band [...] "appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got" [...] in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.|$|E

Her misery is her mirror, and she's forever gazing into it." [...] New York Magazine describe Jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be patronizing. They also observe her as looking [...] "fabulous, fun, and sexy but her downfall is her annoying side." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian branded Jenny a [...] "whiny egomaniac".

500|$|Two mines, the Katy and the Hope, owned {{serially}} {{by several}} different companies between the mid-1890s and the mid-1920s, contributed to Basin's prosperity. In 1894, the Basin and Bay State Mining Company, organized by two brothers named Glass, began expanded operations at these mines. However, flooding and fires caused both mines to close by 1896; the Glass brothers {{lost control of}} the property, and the mines went idle. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> the local mines and despite several disastrous fires in town, Basin prospered. In 1905, the Basin Reduction Company led by F. Augustus Heinze, who owned mines in Butte, took over the properties left by the Glass brothers and improved them. By then, Basin had a population of 1,500, four rooming houses, a drug store, three hotels, a bath house, three grocery stores, a [...] bank, a newspaper, and 12 saloons.|$|E

500|$|... "Elevators (Me & You)" [...] {{illustrates}} OutKast's rise to fame, and {{was inspired}} by a show the band played at Howard University with P. Diddy in the audience. The song also discusses the unlikely partnership of André 3000 and Big Boi, and uses the metaphor of an elevator for <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> fame. [...] The final verse illustrates André 3000 dealing with a fan who pretends to have been childhood friends with him. [...] It also references Southern culture, including mentions of Cadillacs and extended family gatherings. [...] "Babylon" [...] reflects on religious attitudes towards sex and illustrates André 3000's upbringing and his forbidden attractions throughout childhood. [...] "Jazzy Belle" [...] discusses the group's [...] "increasingly enlightened" [...] view regarding women: [...] "Went from yellin'... bitches and hoes to queen thangs". [...] The album's closer [...] "13th Floor/Growing Old" [...] is a meditation on aging and emphasizes Southern hip hop's legitimacy.|$|E
500|$|Development then shifted {{focus to}} the enemies. Landers were given the ability to capture humans, and a new enemy was devised from the mechanic: [...] "Mutants", {{captured}} humans that had turned hostile. The Mutants added a rescue element to the game that Jarvis believed made it more interesting to players and encouraged them to continue playing. The element of making a [...] "comeback" [...] from a dire situation {{was applied to the}} planet as well. Jarvis felt it mimicked <b>the</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> real life. [...] "Bombers", enemies which release floating bombs on the screen, were added next. More enemies were added to create different gameplay elements. [...] "Swarmers" [...] and [...] "Pods" [...] were designed to attack the spaceship as opposed to the astronauts. [...] "Baiters" [...] were included to add pressure to the player by preventing them from lingering. The enemies quickly follow the spaceship to collide with it, and were based on a similar enemy in Asteroids.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, and shot at Venice Beach, California on 21 December 2009.

[...] Prior {{to the release of}} the video, Lewis tweeted [...] "It's a strong, cool performance, lots of actors with a movie feel to it. I'm so proud of it and hope you love it – enjoy!". The video was released on 12 February 2010. In the video, scenes of Lewis performing in front of a heart engulfed in flames, as well as sitting on an apartment floor barefoot, are intercut throughout the video amongst the narrative of the video. The video shows several couples ending their relationships, showing many of them are who angry and cannot cope with the heartbreak, but progresses to show how they manage to rebuild their relationships with one and other, ending with images suggesting healing, happiness and new relationships.|$|E
