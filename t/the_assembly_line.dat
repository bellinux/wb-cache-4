5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E

40|$|A new {{branch-and-bound}} {{algorithm is}} presented to solve <b>the</b> two-sided <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problem of type 1 (TALB- 1).

Some new lower bound on positions are computed, and dominance rules and reduction rules for <b>the</b> one-sided <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> balancing problem of type 1 (OALB- 1) are extended and incorporated into a station-oriented assignment procedure for the TALB- 1 problem.

25|$|Used {{globally}} {{around the}} world, {{an assembly line}} is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner {{in order to create}} a finished product more quickly than with older methods. This type of manufacturing greatly reduces the amount of time taken to assemble a product, thus reducing production, material, and labor costs so that an affordable product cost can be passed onto consumers. According to a book entitled Michigan Yesterday & Today authored by Robert W. Domm, <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> and its basic concept is credited to Ransom Olds, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. Olds patented <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> concept, which he put to work in his Olds Motor Vehicle Company factory in 1901. This development is often overshadowed by Henry Ford, who perfected <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> by installing driven conveyor belts that could produce a Model T in ninety-three minutes.|$|E
