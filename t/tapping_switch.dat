40|$|It {{is known}} that post-movement beta {{synchronization}} (PMBS) is involved both in active inhibition and in sensory reafferences processes. The {{aim of this study}} was examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the PMBS involved during multi-limb coordination task. We investigated post-switching beta synchronization (assigned PMBS) using time-frequency and source estimations analyzes. Participants (n = 17) initiated an auditory-paced bimanual tapping. After a 1500 ms preparatory period, an imperative stimulus required to either selectively stop the left while maintaining the right unimanual <b>tapping</b> (<b>Switch</b> condition: SWIT) or to continue the bimanual tapping (Continue condition: CONT). PMBS significantly increased in SWIT compared to CONT with maximal difference within right central region in broad-band 14 âeuro" 30 Hz and within left central region in restricted-band 22 âeuro" 26 Hz. Source estimations localized these effects within right pre-frontal cortex and left parietal cortex, respectively. A negative correlation showed that participants with a low percentage of errors in SWIT had a large PMBS amplitude within right parietal and frontal cortices. This study shows for the first time simultaneous PMBS with distinct functions in different brain regions and frequency ranges. The left parietal PMBS restricted to 22 âeuro" 26 Hz could reflect the sensory reafferences of the right hand tapping disrupted by the switching. In contrast, the right pre-frontal PMBS in a broad-band 14 âeuro" 30 Hz is likely reflecting the active inhibition of the left hand stopped. Finally, correlations between behavioral performance and the magnitude of the PMBS suggest that beta oscillations {{can be viewed as a}} marker of successful active inhibition...|$|E

30|$|This section {{describes}} how monitoring {{the safety of}} the state of the physical system can improve field station security. Section “Threat model and attack scenario” discusses the threat model and attack scenarios. Section “Interlocks” applies monitoring to identify attacks on the system’s interlocks, and section “Transformer tap switch” applies them to a transformer <b>tap</b> <b>switch.</b> Then, section “Advantages of monitoring in a simulation testbed” lists the advantages of using the proposed testbed.|$|R
30|$|In {{the initial}} attack {{scenario}} an attacker attempts to disconnect power lines {{controlled by the}} RTU 3 (cf. Fig.  4 b), one by one. That RTU initially does not perform any of the safety checks as defined in Table  3, i.e., it directly executes the received command. Then the attack scenario is changed, such that the attacker attempts to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> controlled by RTU 1 (cf. Fig.  4 b) to an unsafe position.|$|R
5000|$|The EX-260 {{features}} set-in neck {{construction in}} a 24.75" [...] scale. The fingerboard features dot inlays with the model {{name at the}} 12th fret. It has 22 extra jumbo frets.

It has one volume and one tone control knob with a 3-way toggle.The tone control knob has a coil <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> that is actuated by pulling up on the knob and thus turning the humbuckers into single coil pickups.|$|R
30|$|Also the {{real-time}} {{capabilities of}} the proposed approach can be evaluated for the presented test cases. The first investigated scenario, i.e., monitoring the interlocks, focused on 4 elements in the switch vector describing {{part of the system}} state, and on the sensor measurements on the 4 connected power lines. The second scenario investigated the transformer <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position vector with a single element and the sensor readings of two power lines on the primary and secondary side of the transformer. In these scenarios, calculating the resulting system state and the policy checking within Bro caused message delays of only 0.002 ms on average.|$|R
5000|$|Event Detection and Classification. Events such {{as various}} types of faults, <b>tap</b> changes, <b>switching</b> events, circuit {{protection}} devices. Machine learning and signal classification methods {{can be used to}} develop algorithms to identify these significant events.|$|R
30|$|The system {{state can}} change upon {{receiving}} any new information, e.g., {{information from the}} sensors with different voltage readings result in an updated state. Different power values of the sources or loads also update the state. Moreover, a command to open or close any of the switches, or changing the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position brings the system to another state. For constant power sources and loads, for now, only two types of events are considered: (i) readings, and (ii) commands. Readings update the state to a new state T′=(S′,F′,M′,P′,T′), whereas a command {{will result in a}} new state T′ with an updated vector S′, collecting the states of the switches, or/and new vector of transformer states T′.|$|R
30|$|Transformers connect {{parts of}} the power system that operate at {{different}} voltage levels. A transformer Ti for i ∈{ 1,..., |T|} has the following properties: transformation rate Ti.r, which defines the voltage ratio (e.g., the ratio 1000 : 1 transforms voltage from 400 kV to 400 V), and the transformer tap position Ti.p. The position of the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> of a Medium to Low Voltage transformer has to be chosen such that the secondary voltage, that is delivered to the customers, equals 230 V. The measurements are not taken directly on the windings of the transformer, but on the incoming and outgoing lines, which results in an accurate approximation. All properties of the transformers are listed in Table  1.|$|R
50|$|The pickup {{configuration}} is HSS.The guitar has one master {{volume control}} (1MΩ pot) and one tone master control (250kΩ pot), {{in addition to}} a 5-way pickup selector switch and a coil <b>tap</b> toggle <b>switch</b> to split the humbucker, i.e. use it in a single-coil configuration.|$|R
30|$|The main safety {{requirement}} that is tested when changing the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position is the voltage {{value on the}} secondary windings of the transformer. The safety requirement defined in Table  3 defines that the voltage has to be equal to the nominal value ± 10 %. This is defined for the Low Voltage areas (CENELEC 1988), however, in the proposed approach {{it is also possible}} to perform the same check for Medium Voltage, like proposed in Isozaki et al. (2014). The implementation of the monitoring tool on RTU 1 that controls the transformer needs to be done similarly like shown in section “Implementation of the interlocks” for interlocks (and is not shown here in detail). In the following, only the outcome of the performed tests are shown.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{it used to}} be {{possible}} to make calls from coin-box phones (payphones) by <b>tapping</b> the <b>switch</b> hook without depositing coins. A person caught tapping could be charged with 'abstracting electricity' from the General Post Office and several cases were prosecuted under this offence.|$|R
30|$|The {{previous}} scenario was {{analyzing the}} situation of an RTU controlling a bus operating at a Medium Voltage level. The following scenario monitors an RTU that controls different voltage levels, namely High and Medium Voltage. This is done via so-called tap switches; by changing their setting, the transformer changes {{the ratio of the}} voltage values on its primary and secondary side. This ratio change results in changing the value of the secondary voltage, while the voltage on the primary side remains the same. The transformer marked in Fig.  4 a connects the High and Medium Voltage levels and contains a controllable <b>tap</b> <b>switch.</b> The operator can send commands from the control room in order to change the value of the voltage on the secondary side of the transformer.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{there is}} more than one pickup, a pickup {{selector}} switch is usually present. These typically select or combine the outputs of two or more pickups, so that two-pickup guitars have three-way switches, and three-pickup guitars have five-way switches (a Gibson Les Paul three-pickup Black Beauty has a three-position toggle switch which configures bridge, bridge and middle in middle position and neck pickups). Further circuitry sometimes combines pickups in different ways. For instance, phase switching places one pickup out of phase with the other(s), leading to a [...] "honky", [...] "nasal", or [...] "funky" [...] sound. Individual pickups can also have their timbre altered by <b>switches,</b> typically coil <b>tap</b> <b>switches</b> that effectively short-circuit some of a dual-coil pickup's windings to produce a tone similar to a single-coil pickup (usually done with push-pull volume knobs).|$|R

30|$|This paper also {{presents}} {{an approach to}} implement policies depending on the system state, using the Bro network intrusion detection system. Knowing the system physical constraints and safety requirements, such as the interlocks, the proposed detection mechanism is configured and updated in order to reject commands that can bring the physical system to an unsafe state. Even though the rules are static, {{the outcome of a}} command at a particular moment in time depends on {{the current state of the}} physical system. For various examples, it is presented how such local monitoring helps to improve the security of the power distribution field stations, when malicious commands are sent from the control room (insider attacks). This has been illustrated for two different settings, one in the medium voltage area (interlocks) and one between medium and high voltage (<b>tap</b> <b>switch).</b>|$|R

30|$|While the {{previous}} scenario covered all initially safe configurations, this section {{focuses on the}} analysis of the interaction in the testbed between receiving commands and issuing alerts, as presented in Fig.  7. The upper part of Fig.  7 indicates the time when commands are sent by the attacker and the reaction of the monitoring tool to these commands. The events marked with a green pentagon represent alerts issued by Bro upon receiving the command to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> to a position that would result in a too high secondary voltage. This is a result of implementing the voltage safety requirement (cf. Table  3) upon receiving a new command (cf. the right-side loop of Fig.  2). Note that Fig.  2 indicates that the command that may bring the system to an unsafe state should be discarded. Here, only an alert was given in order to analyze the further behavior of the system.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies on}} voltage {{stability}} analysis of electric systems with high photovoltaic (PV) penetration {{have been conducted}} at a power-transmission level, but very few have focused on small-area networks of low voltage. As a distribution system has its special characteristicshigh R/X ratio, long <b>tap</b> <b>switching</b> delay, small PV units, and so onPV integration impacts {{also need to be}} investigated thoroughly at a distribution level. In this paper, the IEEE 13 bus system has been modified and extended to explore network stability impacts of variable PV generation, and the results show that a voltage stability issue with PV integration does exist in distribution networks. Simulation comparisons demonstrate that distribution networks are traditionally designed for heavily loaded situations exclusive of PVs, but they can still operate under low PV penetration levels without cloud-induced voltage-stability problems. It is also demonstrated that voltage instability can effectively be solved by PV inverter reactive power support if this scheme is allowed by the standards in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Transformer is {{the most}} {{important}} unit in an electrical distribution network. All transformers are subjected to various tests at the manufacturer&rsquo;s test laboratory before despatch to the destination of erection. Measurement of turn&rsquo;s ratio is one of the routine tests which each transformer has to undergo. &nbsp; In the case of an ordinary winding resistance meter, we can measure the winding resistance and the contact resistance together. It is not possible to measure the contact resistance separately by this meter. Now contact resistance meter is available, it is designed to measure the contact resistances of various Test Objects such as Transformers, Circuit Breakers, Isolators, Bus-bar joints, Welded joints etc. Advanced winding resistance ohmmeter with Dynamic resistance measurement for OLTC is available now with an International trademark. The dynamic resistance measurement detects carbonized spots and weak contacts in the mechanism of a tap changer. In this paper, I wish to discuss the practical differences created in the turn ratio measurement because of the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> contact resistance. ...|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{the first}} contribution, this paper {{presents}} {{the integration of the}} simulation of the physical power distribution with a discrete-event simulation of the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) used for control purposes. Moreover, this paper shows how the previously proposed local monitoring approach can improve the security of the distributed field stations at different voltage levels. For so-called interlocks, i.e., mutually dependent states of system elements, the proposed monitoring prevents the execution of 33.3 % of all commands. Without the proposed approach in place, those commands would have resulted in an unsafe state of the power distribution. The remaining two-thirds of the commands yield a safe state of the power distribution, i.e., all the neighborhoods remain connected to the power grid. Hence, the approach allows the RTU to execute them, even though they might come from an untrusted source. In a second scenario, monitoring is used to identify commands to change the <b>tap</b> <b>switch</b> position of a transformer, which lead the system into an unsafe state. This could either lead to an alert or potentially, to discarding the packet with the malicious command.|$|R

50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{tap changer}} physically makes the new connection before releasing the old using multiple <b>tap</b> selector <b>switches</b> but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} diverter switch to temporarily place a large diverter impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type tap changer, the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the diverter. A reactance type tap changer uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the diverter impedance, and a reactance type tap changer is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|When {{going from}} Delft to Rotterdam by train, or when driving over the highway, or biking through the Dutch landscape, {{did you ever}} look up and wonder about the network of power lines that span our country? The {{electricity}} network, globally on of the largest structures created by mankind, is a complex system consisting of thousands of power transmission lines, power generation stations, transformer substations, and consumption points. Day-in day-out electricity is transmitted from one point to another to enable our modern life. Can you imagine living a whole day with no electricity at all? To ensure efficient and secure operation of power networks, network operators adjust controls in the network to meet certain control objectives. These controls consist of adjusting power generation, changing transformer <b>taps,</b> <b>switching</b> off consumption, etc. Control objectives typically consist of maintaining values of network variables like voltages and frequency at or close to pre-specified values. The values of these network variables can be manipulated by changing the flows of power over the network. Network operators change the flow of power over the network by using the controls available. Although controlling the flows {{has always been a}} challenging task, the ever growing increase of energy consumption, the changes in the power market, and the increasing appearance of small scale, so-called embedded generation, make the control of power networks in the future become even more challenging.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades many voltage {{collapse}} incidents have occurred, caused by uncoordinated interactions of local controllers, following a major disturbance in {{electric power system}} operating {{closer and closer to}} their safety limits. Currently most voltage control schemes are rule-based and only rely on local measurements. However the availability of wide-area phasor measurements (WAMS/PMU) suggests that the risk of voltage collapse could be reduced by coordinating control actions in neighboring control regions of the network. This paper shows how distributed model predictive control (MPC) can be used in order to design such a coordinating controller. Local control agents carry out an on-line optimization by comparing the plant behavior over a finite window in time, for different possible switching sequences of the local tap changing transformer (LTC). The evolution of the plant behavior is obtained by a fast Modelica simulation of the hybrid systems model, using information on the <b>tap</b> <b>switching</b> sequences that neighboring control regions are planning to implement on their LTCs. Through simulation of a 12 -bus power system this paper shows that the distributed MPC controllers can prevent, or at least postpone, voltage collapse in circumstances where classical uncoordinated controllers fail. The required communication exchange is very limited, making practical applications feasible. However extensions to larger systems will require consideration of modeling abstractions of neighboring control regions, so as to keep the simulation time for each local decision maker short...|$|R
