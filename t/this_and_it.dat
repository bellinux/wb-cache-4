5|$|Boniface and his {{elder brother}} Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy, were sons of Thomas I, Count of Savoy, and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would have been very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, under the impression that he could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including some government work on technical standards.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{to regain}} for himself the kingdom lost by his {{half-brother}} Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (Holmgard) to Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg) where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, {{and then into}} the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> {{claims to have}} one of the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended to them in the 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E

A fit hill walker can complete the 275 metre ascent from the centre car park in half an hour.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the TOPS {{computer}} system for managing locomotives and rolling stock {{owned by a}} rail system, was introduced. Hauled rolling stock continued to carry numbers in a separate series. The adoption of the TOPS system made for {{some changes in the}} way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives were numbered in three different series. Steam locomotives carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. Diesel locomotives carried four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D' and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number - steam loco 4321, diesel D4321 and electric loco E4321. TOPS could not handle <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, in order that they might be treated together as a group. A new classification system was devised in which, for example, all Brush Type 4 locomotives were now called Class 47 and all had numbers beginning 47xxx.|$|E
25|$|Seven weeks later, on 21 September a {{party of}} Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed {{coalition}} of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were {{under the command of}} a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from the roof of his house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy {{in the minds of the}} Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the ‘wreckers’ became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of absentee landlord, Lord Charlemont.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the month}} before the 2007 race, there was much debate over a recent change in the Little 500 rules. While {{it has been a}} long-standing {{tradition}} in the race that teams have alumni riders coach them, IUSF decided to introduce a new mandatory system of coaching: the student coach. The idea behind it was twofold. One was to involve more students in the race to make it more like the original race before alumni riders existed, and another was to help give independent teams a better chance of success in the race. While both of these goals were both valid and likely needed, the rule change caused many problems. The first problem was that it was difficult for teams to find students that were interested in being a student coach. Secondly, the new rule was going to prohibit alumni coaches from being in their respective team's pit on race day. Both of these caused a great deal of controversy, to the point that some teams were threatening to boycott the race. In the end, some form of a compromise was reached: every team had a student coach, and on race day the alumni coaches were allowed to be in the pit. While it all turned out probably for the best, this rule change did change the race. There were teams that lost their alumni coaches due to <b>this.</b> <b>And</b> <b>it</b> is believed that this rule change {{is one of the reasons}} why the women's race did not have a full field in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Coucy was {{not with}} the crusader body as it traveled, having been {{detached}} on a diplomatic mission to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the Duke of Milan. Furious at French political maneuvering that had removed Genoa from his influence, Gian Galeazzo had been attempting to stop the transfer of Genoese sovereignty to France and Coucy was dispatched to warn him that France would consider further interference a hostile act. The quarrel was more than political. Valentina Visconti, {{the wife of the}} Duke of Orleans and Gian Galeazzo's beloved daughter, had been exiled from Paris due the machinations of Queen Isabeau the same month as the departure of the crusade. The Duke of Milan threatened to send knights to defend his daughter's honor but, {{in the wake of the}} disaster at Nicopolis, it was widely believed that he had relayed intelligence to Bayezid I of crusader troop movements. There is no firm evidence of <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is likely that Gian Galeazzo became a scapegoat after the fact due the existing animosity with France, though there remains the possibility that the Duke of Milan, who had murdered his own uncle to ensure his own power, did in fact betray the crusaders. Coucy, his diplomatic mission complete and accompanied by Henry of Bar and their followers, left Milan for Venice, from where he requisitioned a ship on 17 May to take him across the Adriatic Sea, landing in the Croatian port of Senj on 30 May before making his way overland to the rendezvous in Buda.|$|E
25|$|Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) Chief Yellowcoat/Sports Organiser/Radio Maplin Announcer – Gladys {{was born}} in 1933 in Pontypridd, and spent her youth in the Rhondda Valley. She joined Maplins holiday camp in 1955 and rose through the ranks to become sports {{organiser}} and later chief Yellowcoat. She won the competition for the most popular girl Yellowcoat every year between when she joined and 1959, when she was beaten by Sylvia Garnsey. Upon Jeffrey Fairbrother's arrival at the camp {{at the start of}} the 1959 season, she fell passionately in love with him, although he did not reciprocate this. On one occasion, she found herself in a situation where Jeffrey had unintentionally become drunk, and she helped him back to his chalet. The following morning he awoke naked with no memory of the previous night, and found Gladys' bra in his bed. What actually happened was left ambiguous. Gladys disliked all the other female Yellowcoats, in particular Sylvia Garnsey, whom she saw as competition in her fight for Jeffrey's affections. Like Jeffrey, she also disapproved of Ted's schemes to scam the campers, even though she secretly had her own scheme selling reconditioned tennis balls. In the 1960 season, Spike Dixon fell in love with her, although she never knew <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> never amounted to anything. Gladys was left heartbroken when Jeffrey departed for Wisconsin without telling anyone at the end of the season, but she quickly recovered upon meeting Squadron Leader Clive Dempster, who arrived to take over Fairbrother's job. She immediately became attracted to Clive, and the two had an on-off relationship throughout the 1960 season. She eventually married Clive and moved to Australia with him at the end of the season.|$|E
