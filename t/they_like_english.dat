40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were 1) {{to find out the}} learning needs and target needs of the first grade students of elementary school, and 2) to design appropriate English learning materials for the first grade students of elementary school. This research was categorized as Educational Research and Development (R&D). Jolly and Bolitho in Tomlinson proposed a process of materials writing. They were simplified into conducting need analysis, writing the course grid, writing the first draft, evaluation by an expert and writing the final draft. The data of {{this research}} were collected through interview, observation and questionnaire which were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results of this study were as follow 1) first grade students were not aware to feel any need of <b>English</b> and <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>English</b> taught in varied activities, 2) the units designed were appropriate for the 1 st grade students. It was proven by the mean value obtained from the questionnaire distributed to the material expert. The mean value of this material was 2, 97. It is considered in the Good category...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} Japanese engineering students’ attitudes towards EFL learning. Data for this study was derived from two different sources, a questionnaire with open-ended items, and reading journals. The questionnaire asked students across proficiency levels about their preferences and attitudes in English learning, while the reading journals traced intermediate learners’ weekly reactions to out-of-class extensive reading assignments. It was found that: 1) the ratio of students who <b>like</b> <b>English</b> and their reasons differ according to their proficiency levels, 2) students who are either in the advanced classes or those who <b>like</b> <b>English</b> in the beginner and intermediate classes wish to develop oral communication skills (i. e., speaking and listening), whereas those who dislike English in the lower classes have a greater desire to improve their receptive skills (i. e., reading and listening) and vocabulary, and 3) even though the majority of students said <b>they</b> didn’t <b>like</b> <b>English</b> at the beginning of the semester, most of them responded positively towards extensive reading after twelve weeks of out-of-class extensive reading assignments. 研究報...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{attempted to}} reconcile discrepant recent findings relating to children’s color naming and categorization. In a replication of Franklin and colleagues (Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 90 (2005) 114 – 141), Experiment 1 tested English toddlers’ naming and memory for blue–green and blue–purple colors. It also found advantages for between-category presentations {{that could be}} interpreted as support for universal color categories. However, a different definition of knowing color terms led to quite different conclusions in line with the Whorfian view of Roberson and colleagues (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133 (2004) 554 – 571). Categorical perception in recognition memory was now found only for children with a fuller understanding of the relevant terms. It was concluded that color naming can both underestimate and overestimate toddlers’ knowledge of color terms. Experiment 2 replicated the between-category recognition superiority found in Himba children by Franklin and colleagues for the blue–purple range. But Himba children, whose language does not have separate terms for green and blue, did not show a cross-category advantage for that set; rather, <b>they</b> behaved <b>like</b> <b>English</b> children who did not know their color terms...|$|R

40|$|Many {{secondary}} students feel that English {{is difficult to}} learn but, in their real life, <b>they</b> <b>like</b> to sing <b>English</b> songs.

A common practice of using songs in an English classroom is for listening comprehension exercise in middle, high school, and college level or for teaching vocabulary to young learners. This paper, however, explores more in a song— to teach grammar, writing, speaking, poetic aspects, as well as pronunciation. Further, depending on the message, songs can also touch feelings, for instance, awakening young people’s care and sensitivity toward others...|$|R

5000|$|Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers is a 1974 {{anthology}} by Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, Shawn Wong {{and other}} members of the Combined Asian Resources Project (CARP). It helped establish Asian American Literature as a field by recovering and collecting representative selections from Chinese-, Japanese-, and Filipino-Americans from the past fifty years—many of whom had been mostly forgotten. This pan-Asian anthology included selections from Carlos Bulosan, Diana Chang, Louis Chu, Momoko Iko, Wallace Lin, Toshio Mori, John Okada, Oscar Peñaranda, Sam Tagatac, Hisaye Yamamoto, Wakako Yamauchi, many of whom are now staples in Asian American literature course. Because of this anthology and the work of CARP, many of these authors have been republished; at that time, however, they received little attention from publishers critics because they didn't subscribe to popular stereotypes but depicted what Elaine H. Kim calls the [...] "unstereotyped aspects of Asian American experience". The [...] "aiiieeeee!" [...] of the title comes from a stereotypical expression used by Asian characters in old movies, radio and television shows, comic books, etc. These same stereotypes affected the anthology itself: when the editors tried to find a publisher, they had to turn to a historically African-American press because, as Chin states:The blacks were the first to take us seriously and sustained the spirit of many Asian American writers.... It wasn't surprising to us that Howard University Press understood us and set out to publish our book with their first list. <b>They</b> <b>liked</b> our <b>English</b> we spoke sic and didn't accuse us of unwholesome literary devices.|$|R
