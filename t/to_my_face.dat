2500|$|At the Church Assembly on 15 November 1956, Bulmer-Thomas {{attacked}} Fisher, {{saying that}} he [...] "held a pistol <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> while the Dean of Gloucester plunged his dagger into my back", which shocked some listeners. Bulmer-Thomas went away and made his own plans.|$|E
2500|$|Although Seven was {{originally}} introduced as a foil for Captain Janeway, {{with the two}} of them proving to be very adversarial, they gained mutual respect as time went by. Ryan later described this as a mother-daughter relationship on the show, although she said that the writers had managed to make the character into more of an unruly teenager. However, the inclusion of Seven of Nine as a primary character for the show alongside Janeway and the Doctor was criticised by other actors such as Robert Beltran, who played Chakotay. He felt that his character, along with Harry Kim, Tuvok and Neelix, had been overlooked. As the end of the series approached, Ryan remarked that she would [...] "love to do something without special effects or rubber glued <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> it'd be a nice change of pace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> it felt as though I was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hardly knew}} what <b>to</b> say. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> must have {{expressed}} disappointment and surprise.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he looked}} at me, and his {{brooding}} eyes seemed <b>to</b> scan <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|I bowed <b>my</b> head <b>to</b> hide <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{and found}} her hand in mine and kissed it.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Tijerina was first {{encouraged}} to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch. As Tijerina recalls, [...] "He said <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> 'I don't like preachers, they {{take advantage of}} the people. What I think you should do is quit talking religion. What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that … you should study law and history and help your people.'" [...] In June 1956, Tijerina and a few bravos went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. [...] There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. [...] Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. [...] The next day, they took Tijerina's group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised his}} dark, gentle eyes <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and seemed surprised.|$|E
60|$|LAWSON. Do {{you say it}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> sir? Dod, sir, I'm the Crown Prosecutor.|$|E
60|$|You pay {{me a great}} compliment, Alec. You repeat <b>to</b> <b>my</b> very <b>face</b> one of <b>my</b> {{favourite}} observations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{want some}} juice <b>to</b> make <b>my</b> <b>face</b> yellow like a mulatto. Anyone {{could see that}} I was not a negro in the daylight." ...|$|R
60|$|I set <b>my</b> lips <b>to</b> the tankard, {{and drank}} long, <b>to</b> hide <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{and for that}} I was nigh swooning with a passion of fear and wrath.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fox and Comyn {{laughed so}} immoderately as {{to bring the}} blood <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|He comes {{very slowly}} back to me, licks my hand, and lifts his dim eyes <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pooh! nonsense!' said Mr. Spenlow, reddening. 'Pray don't tell me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> {{that you}} love my daughter, Mr. Copperfield!' ...|$|E
60|$|And then I {{just put}} <b>my</b> hands up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> burning <b>face</b> {{and the tears}} that would never come before came in a flood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} <b>to</b> push <b>my</b> <b>face</b> quite into them--the dears!" [...] she had said. [...] "But I {{suppose it is}} against the rules to touch them--isn't it, Jude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She may {{stay with}} us," [...] the father said, turning to his eldest daughter; [...] "but I shall {{never be able}} <b>to</b> show <b>my</b> <b>face</b> again about the parish." ...|$|R
60|$|Comyn laughed, and I {{felt the}} blood rise <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and kicked John Paul viciously. Dolly {{retained}} her self-possession.|$|E
60|$|At {{times when}} people pass my room--my maid Nitnitzka, or Jakub, the serving-man--and see me talking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> they think I am foolish.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not understand!" [...] {{he whispered}} close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> He {{waved his hand}} vaguely skyward, the vague {{suggestion}} of still vaguer thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> turn <b>my</b> <b>face</b> from her. [...] "Don't ask me!" [...] I said. [...] "Have I {{suffered}} {{as you have}} suffered? What right have I to decide?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "I {{only want}} {{something}} <b>to</b> stain <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and hands, and I shall {{be able to}} pass anywhere, if it does not come to talking." ...|$|R
60|$|She leaned forward. I {{think that}} she was trying <b>to</b> look into <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I mean <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> as you do," [...] {{she went}} on, {{allowing}} {{herself to be}} further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously forbidden.|$|E
6000|$|If I {{lived here}} a hundred years, could a worse thing come than that [...] Laegaire and Conall should know me and bid me begone <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{question}} {{always brought}} the shadow back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "Not very well,--but we hope she'll be better {{when she gets}} back here among her own folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't excuse {{yourself}} to me, unless you wish <b>to</b> embitter <b>my</b> shame. I'm obliged {{to you for}} offering to share your destitution with me. I must try <b>to</b> run <b>my</b> <b>face</b> with the landlord," [...] said Colville.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Aunt Pen, {{you want}} me to look pretty and be a credit to you; but how would you like <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> <b>face</b> the color of those geraniums all the evening?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘She is {{not allowed}} <b>to</b> look at <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> ‘and I cannot look at her face.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Bearin's hot, eh?' said McRimmon. 'It's thirty {{year since}} a man daur curse me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Time was I'd ha' cast ye doon the {{stairway}} for that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] I said, {{pointing}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> [...] "here's Miss Mannering's signature to {{my order}} of dismissal and--I'll {{thank you for}} that lakh as soon as convenient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I haven't {{been telling}} you. It IS necessary. If that money thinks it {{can stand up}} right <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and say I can't go riding with you--" ...|$|E
60|$|She flouted my denial. She laughed deliciously at {{something}} she seemed <b>to</b> see in <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ant. Then {{give the}} word to march: I long to leave this prison of a town, To join thy legions; and, in open field, Once more <b>to</b> show <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Lead, <b>my</b> deliverer.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must know," [...] she insisted. [...] "Have I not the right? Tell me now: Was it {{that you}} wished <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> <b>face</b> again before they gave me over to the grave?" ...|$|R
