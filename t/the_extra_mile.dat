Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a 'heroic love' set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November Lip Magazines Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, [...] " [...] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols.

40|$|Purpose – International {{comparison}} studies {{provide a}} useful opportunity in logistics to benchmark logistics practices. Given this, {{it is perhaps}} surprising that there {{do not appear to}} be any benchmarking studies comparing performance between the developed and developing world. The paper aims to address this shortcoming, focusing on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution networks from the UK and South Africa as comparator countries. Design/methodology/approach – A two-stage study has been undertaken. Firstly, a focus group approach was undertaken to identify the main causes of supply chain uncertainty affecting freight transport operations in FMCG distribution. In the second phase, four case studies (two in the UK and two in South Africa) were undertaken to examine how logistics is managed and the impact of uncertainty. Findings – In the focus groups undertaken in both countries, the uncertainty clusters found were very similar, if not the same. However, when looking into the findings from the case studies, <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> <b>miles</b> generated due to uncertainty within the supply chains studied was greater in the South African distribution networks studied than in their UK counterparts. Furthermore, the UK distribution networks studied seem to be more effective in terms of uncertainty preparedness and responsiveness than their South African counterparts. Originality/value – The paper has identified significant differences in terms of uncertainty preparedness and responsiveness within the distribution networks studied from the UK and South Africa. Nevertheless, more case studies need to be run in both countries, and in different sectors, to verify those differences...|$|R

50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{release of}} <b>Extra</b> <b>Mile,</b> a band from Tennessee {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Tennessee band, four other bands all filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to Raybon asking the label to pay one-third of their legal costs. The label refused, and Shenandoah filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than $200,000 on court settlements. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The label's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with the label. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|R

5000|$|As a three-year-old, Meadow Star won {{her first}} two races of 1991. Then, up against males {{for the first}} time, she {{finished}} a well-beaten fourth in the Wood Memorial Stakes.

She began with a six-length win in the Acorn Stakes, then ran in the 1⅛ mile Mother Goose Stakes. In this race, she faced Lite Light, whom she had easily beaten in the previous fall's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies but who at age three was a vastly improved filly. After the two ran head-to-head from the turn {{at the top of the}} homstretch, Meadow Star won by a [...] "lip" [...] in a photo finish that took the officials six minutes to adjudicate.
