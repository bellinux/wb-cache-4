25|$|The {{method of}} {{tenacity}} (policy of sticking to initial belief) â€” which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method {{goes against the}} social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.|$|E

When Desdemona produces a different handkerchief, Otello demands the one with strawberries. When {{she says she does}} not have it, Otello says that it was a talisman, and troubles will befall her if she loses it. Desdemona says that he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Cassio's plea, and as she asks him about Cassio, he demands the handkerchief ever more insistently. (Desdemona, Otello: Dio ti giocondi, o sposo / [...] "God keep you merry, husband".) Desdemona protests that she is faithful; Otello sends her away (Desdemona, Otello: Esterrefatta fisso lo sguardo tuo tremendo / [...] "Terrified, I face your dreadful look").|$|E

6000|$|Everything in England is appreciable to the {{literary}} sense, while {{the sense of}} {{the literary}} worth of things in America is still faint and weak with most people, with the vast majority who [...] "ask for the great, the remote, the romantic," [...] who cannot [...] "embrace the common," [...] cannot [...] "sit {{at the feet of the}} familiar and the low," [...] in the good company of Emerson. We are all, or nearly all, struggling to be distinguished from the mass, and to be set apart in select circles and upper classes like the fine people we have read about. We are really a mixture of the plebeian ingredients of the whole world; but that is not bad; our vulgarity consists in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> [...] "the worth of the vulgar," [...] in believing that the superfine is better.|$|E
6000|$|We in Britain are not clear-minded, I {{would point}} out, {{because we are}} double-minded. No good end is served by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> in the fancied {{interests}} of [...] "unity" [...] a division of spirit and intention that trips us up at every step. We are, we declare, fighting for a complete change in international methods, and we are bound {{to stick to the}} logical consequences of that. We have placed ourselves on the side of democratic revolution against autocratic monarchy, and we cannot afford to go on shilly-shallying with that choice. We cannot in these days of black or white play the part of lukewarm friends to freedom. I will not remind the reader here of the horrible vacillations and inconsistencies of policy in Greece that have prolonged the war and cost us wealth and lives beyond measure, but President Wilson himself has reminded us pungently enough and sufficiently enough of the follies and disingenuousness of our early treatment of the Russian Revolution. What I want to point out here is the supreme importance of a clear lead in this matter now in order that we should state our War Aims effectively.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think there}} can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving {{realisation}} that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly one's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One walks silenced through a world that one feels {{to be full of}} inaudible accusations. One cannot challenge the assault, get it out into the open, separate truth and falsehood. It slinks from you, turns aside its face. Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made extraordinary excuses; men who had presumed on the verge of my world and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise, now took the bold step of flat repudiation. I became doubtful about the return of a nod, retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto spread to the world. I still grow warm with amazed indignation when I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting me full {{on the steps of the}} Climax Club, cut me dead. [...] "By God!" [...] I cried, and came near catching him by the throat and wringing out of him what of all good deeds and bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and empty beyond comparison, to dare to play the judge to me. And then I had an open slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts upon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they were disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential confidence of life, as though a hand of wet ice had touched my heart. Similar things were happening to Isabel. Yet we went on working, visiting, meeting, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> this gathering of implacable forces against us.|$|E

60|$|We liked {{far better}} the pretty Alameda rising in {{terraces}} from it with beds of flowers beside the promenade, and boys playing up and down, and old men {{sitting in the}} sun, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the wind that blew over them too freshly for us. Our policeman confessed {{that there was nothing}} more worth seeing in Tarifa, and we entreated of him the favor of showing us a shop where we could buy a Cordovese hat; a hat which we had seen nourishing on the heads of all men in Cordova and Seville and Granada and Ronda, and had always forborne to buy because we could get it anywhere; and now we were almost leaving Spain without it. We wanted one brown in color, as well as stiff and flat of brim, and slightly conical in form; and our policeman promptly imagined it, and took us to a shop abounding solely in hats, and especially in Cordoveses. The proprietor came out wiping his mouth from an inner room, where he had left his family visibly at their almuerzo; and then we were desolated together that he should only have Cordoveses that were black. But passing a patio where there was a poinsettia in brilliant bloom against the wall, we found ourselves in a variety store where there were Cordoveses of all colors; and we chose one of the right brown, with the picture of a beautiful Spanish girl, wearing a pink shawl, inside the crown which was fluted round in green and red ribbon. Seven pesetas was the monstrous asking price, but we beat it down to five and a half, and then came a trying moment: we could not carry a Cordovese in tissue-paper through the streets of Tarifa, but could we ask our guide, who was also our armed escort, to carry it? He simplified the situation by taking it himself and bearing it back to the fonda as proudly as if he had not also worn a sword at his side; and we parted there in a kindness which I should like to think he shared equally with us.|$|E
