5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} like <b>those</b> <b>of</b> grasshoppers. The mandibles {{appear as}} large pincers {{on the front}} of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the males enlarged enormously compared with <b>those</b> <b>of</b> females of the same species.|$|E

5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and <b>those</b> <b>of</b> C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not always easy.|$|E
