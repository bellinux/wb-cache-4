5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so sure that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E
5|$|The Su-35 {{project was}} aimed {{primarily}} at the export market. During {{the early stages}} of the flight-test programme, Sukhoi estimated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a market for 160 aircraft, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Some of the candidate countries, such as Algeria, Malaysia, and India, were already operators of the Su-30MK family. As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010, the actual launch order for 48 Su-35S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the 2009 MAKS Air Show (as part of a larger deal worth US$2.5billion for 64 fighter aircraft). During the type's international debut at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Mikhail Pogosyan, General Director of Sukhoi's parent company United Aircraft Corporation, stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft, split evenly between the domestic and export markets. It was not until the end of 2015 when the first export contract was signed with China; by then, the Russian government had placed a follow-up order for 50 aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Any non-trivial true {{statement}} about reality is necessarily an abstraction {{composed of a}} complex of objects and properties or relations. For example, the fact described by the true statement [...] "Paris is {{the capital city of}} France" [...] implies that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a place as Paris, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a place as France, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a thing as a place or a government, and so on.

25|$|In Britain, {{there are}} {{references}} to salt {{taxes in the}} Domesday Book but they had died out before patents were given in Tudor times.

Reaching the merits that same year, the Court held that the Congressional statute permitting for-cause challenges of jurors who believed that polygamy was divinely compelled applied to grand juries as well as petit juries, and that the marshall could call a second venire if the 200-person venire was exhausted before a full jury was seated.|$|E

Another sixty years passed before John Glanville Gill published the first full-length biography of the slain abolitionist minister and editor. Gill was himself a former Alton minister who, like Lovejoy, also suffered persecution for his commitment to human rights.|$|E
