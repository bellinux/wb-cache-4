For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> philosophy.|$|E

Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. I see how my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure.

However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do." [...] Petraeus added that [...] "There’s a reason that we put people through cultural awareness training....I can assure you that there is much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor." ...|$|E

[...] On 2 December, he told Parliament that he was aware that money had been raised in his name in Haryana, but denied having authorized the appeal or receiving any of its proceeds. [...] He had raised the issue with then Chief Minister of Haryana Om Prakash Chautala, he said, after being hounded by the media in both Fiji and India. [...] He claimed to have discovered only during his 2005 visit to India that Chautala's record with money is not transparent. [...] "My anger about the whole episode is that Shri Chautala should exploit the feelings of the ordinary and poor folks of Haryana who are emotionally tied <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the people of Indian origin in Fiji and play on them a game of deceit for self enrichment," [...] Chaudhry said.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{recurring}} linguistic motif in the play is that of state power as specifically represented by the crown and the throne. Both words occur multiple times throughout the play. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1 (which is set in parliament, with York spending most of the scene sitting on the throne), Warwick introduces the imagery, saying to York [...] "Before I see thee seated in that throne,/Which now the House of Lancaster usurps,/I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close" [...] (ll.22–24). He then introduces the word [...] "crown"; [...] "Resolve thee Richard, claim the English crown" [...] (l.49). Immediately after York sits in the throne, Henry enters, exclaiming, [...] "My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,/Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,/Backed {{by the power of}} Warwick, that false peer,/To aspire unto the crown and reign as king" [...] (ll.50–54). During the subsequent debate over legitimacy, Exeter tells York [...] "Thy father was a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.80), to which York replies [...] "Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.81). Also during the debate, Henry asks York, [...] "And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?" [...] (l.85). York next asks Henry, [...] "Will you we show our title to the crown? (l.103), to which Henry says [...] "What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?" [...] (l.105). As the debate reaches an impasse, Richard urges York, [...] "Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head" [...] (l.115). Henry refuses to yield however, declaring [...] "Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne?" [...] (l.125). Subsequently, during the debate about the conflict between Henry Bolingbrook and Richard II, York asks Exeter if Richard's abdication [...] "was prejudicial to his crown?" [...] (l.145) to which Exeter responds [...] "No, for he could not so resign his crown" [...] (l.146). York then demands that Henry [...] "Confirm the crown <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> mine heirs" [...] (l.173), to which Henry reluctantly agrees, [...] "I here entail/The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever" [...] (ll.195–196).|$|E
