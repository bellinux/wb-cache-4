5|$|According to statistics, the South Okanagan {{region is}} underserved {{in terms of}} airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport {{provides}} international flights to 62commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475people, totaling 25percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport {{was considered to be}} the area's primary airport, hence why people questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> its runway {{was in the process of}} expansion.|$|E
5|$|Ayer {{was devastated}} by {{a fire in}} 1872, but its {{industrial}} connections allowed {{for a period of}} rebuilding and even prosperity after. Most buildings in the Ayer Main Street Historic District were built during <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> the Hoosac Tunnel opened in 1875, trains through Ayer could run on the Fitchburg and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad as far west as Troy, New York. With service to Troy, Boston, Nashua, Worcester, Lowell, and Greenville, Ayer Junction (soon shortened to Ayer) was a major rail interchange and the most important station on the Fitchburg Railroad between Concord and Fitchburg.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the consent decree of 1948 forcing film studios to divest {{themselves}} of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired {{by the success of}} Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E

5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>when,</b> on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} {{delayed the}} conclave until the ambassador of Louis XIV of France and the French cardinals arrived, which demonstrated the influence France {{had in the}} College at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> it opened on 21 December 1669 with fifty-four of the seventy members of the College of Cardinals present with twelve additional cardinals arriving as the conclave progressed. The factions broke down relatively evenly amongst the cardinals loyal to Spain and France, with each country controlling eight. Clement IX's nephew Jacopo Rospigliosi's influence in the conclave was relatively weak as Clement IX had only created eight cardinals, whereas Flavio Chigi led twenty-four creations of Alexander VII.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At <b>that</b> <b>time</b> (<b>when</b> somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E

5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Vitalogy was {{released}} first on vinyl on November 22, 1994, {{two weeks before}} its CD and cassette release, and debuted at No. 55 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

It was the second-fastest selling album in history, behind only the band's previous release Vs. Vitalogy has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and, as of July 2013, has sold 4.77 millioncopies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|While {{the key to}} Albany's {{economic}} prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878–1883), was the last remaining brewer from <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it closed in 1972. The city's location at {{the east end of}} the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west. Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century. Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.|$|E

25|$|The {{half-life}} of {{this drug}} is about 11.5 hours, and the {{concentration in the}} brain remains at around 5–10% of the total dose during <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> a 'mega-dose' is administered, as in state-sanctioned lethal injection, the concentration in the brain during the tail phase of the distribution remains higher than the peak concentration found in the induction dose for anesthesia, because repeated doses—or a single very high dose as in lethal injection—accumulate in high concentrations in body fat, from which the thiopental is gradually released.

25|$|Christianity was a {{minority}} religion {{during much of}} early Roman history, and the early Christians were persecuted during <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> Constantine I converted to Christianity, it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire.

In the view of many historians, the Constantinian shift turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute. There are a number of examples of forced conversion throughout the history of Christianity: during the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages, inquisitions in Spain and Goa, and campaigns by Russian rulers.|$|E
