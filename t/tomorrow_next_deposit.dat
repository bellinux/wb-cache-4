5000|$|Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, the band's second album, was {{released}} in September 1989. The greater vocal contribution by Einar Örn on the record was criticized {{in many of the}} record's reviews, which were noticeably weaker than those for Life's Too Good. Not all critics agreed that it was worse than their debut album, though. Robert Christgau rated it a B+, higher than the B- he gave Life's Too Good. The singles [...] "Regina" [...] and [...] "Planet" [...] topped the UK indie charts but fared poorly in the mainstream charts outside of Iceland. After the release of Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, the band embarked on a lengthy international tour. At the end of the tour, they started to ponder about splitting up and went on a hiatus.|$|R

40|$|Science {{offers more}} than just the yearly cutting edge {{installation}} in a phone series or the next technological interest such as augmented reality headsets. It also offers a whole new perspective on how to view the world, from understanding how everyday things work through to the intrigue of space and the very small dimensions of the Universe.

5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the tour in late 1990, the band members pursued their own individual interests. Stick Around for Joy, the bands third and final album, was released in February 1992. It received noticeably better reviews than Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, and spawned the bands first big hit single, the aptly titled [...] "Hit". Further singles [...] "Walkabout" [...] and [...] "Vitamin" [...] failed to make any chart impact. The Sugarcubes opened for U2 during the US leg of their Zoo TV Tour in October and November 1992, playing to a grand total of 700,000 people.|$|R
50|$|Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week! is {{the second}} studio album by Icelandic {{alternative}} rock band The Sugarcubes, released in September 1989 through Elektra Records. A version of the album sung in Icelandic titled Illur Arfur! (English: Bad Legacy!) was released as well, with the same English track listing, {{under the name of}} Sykurmolarnir (The Sugarcubes in Icelandic). The album reached #70 on the Billboard 200, #15 on the UK Albums Chart and #1 on the UK Indie Albums chart. The album wasn't as well received by critics as their critically acclaimed debut album, Life's Too Good, and was criticized for Einar's greater vocal contribution.|$|R
40|$|How does memory {{retrieval}} {{depend on}} time scale? One strong {{hypothesis is that}} such retrieval is scale-invariant (i. e., invariant across different time scales). To test this hypothesis, three groups of participants were given 4 min to recall what they did yesterday, last week, or last year (retrospective memories), and 4 min to recall what they intended to do <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>next</b> week, or next year (prospective memories). In line with scale invariance, retrieval performance was indistinguishable across time scales, for both retrospective and prospective memory. An additional finding was that significantly more prospective memories were recalled than retrospective memories, confirming previous observations of the "intention-superiority effect" (Goschke & Kuhl, 1993). ...|$|R

30|$|Scenarios {{are about}} making {{stories about the}} future and usually have more {{specific}} detail than backcasting. They represent a series of events that we envision or imagine happening in the future. Visionary scenarios are part of everyday thinking in that it is filled with some ventures into the unknown or mysterious world of the future, <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>next</b> week, next year, or next decade. The more elaborate scenarios (e.g., a generation of simulation games for policymakers combining known facts about the future with key driving forces identified by considering environmental, economic, social, political, and technological trends) are usually developed by professional researchers (or groups of analysts) working for government agencies in relation to different domains or for organizations and institutions.|$|R
40|$|We are {{currently}} {{faced with a}} seemingly endless list of global and local uncertainties. What will the global financial markets do <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>next</b> week, or next month? What {{is the reality of}} climate change, and what will its impacts be? What does the future hold for Australia’s resources sector? These issues are of critical concern not just to governments and policy makers, but to business and society in general. Amid such uncertainty, how should managers plan for the future? Some planners seek to address uncertainty through probability analysis and predictive planning. However, such approaches have proved less than reliable. Others see unpredictability as reason to sit back and wait to see what happens. [Read full-text via link above...|$|R

5000|$|The band {{received}} {{critical and}} popular acclaim internationally. Their debut studio album, Life's Too Good, {{was released in}} April 1988 to unexpected international success. It is credited as the first Icelandic album to have a worldwide impact and is considered a definite influence on all subsequent Icelandic popular music. It spanned the band's signature hit [...] "Birthday". Their follow-up album, Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, was released in September 1989 to lukewarm reviews from some critics and fans. Critic Robert Christgau rated it higher than their debut, with a B+. Their third and final album, Stick Around for Joy, released in February 1992, was more well received by both fans and critics and had two successful singles: [...] "Hit" [...] and [...] "Leash Called Love." [...] The Sugarcubes have been regarded as [...] "the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland." ...|$|R

50|$|Pseuactinocerids are {{characterized}} by elongated, straight and gently curved shells with a subcentral siphuncle composed of broadly expanded segments in the adult {{in which there are}} internal deposits pieced by two series of radial canals. Deposits form initially at the septal openings and grow mostly forward to connect with the <b>next</b> <b>deposit</b> in the anterior part of the next segment. The radial canals connect the interior of the segments with the ends of the connecting rings as they approach adjacent septa. Camerae, which are generally short, are commonly filled with organic deposits.|$|R
