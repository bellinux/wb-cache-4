40|$|Well and Inflow Performance Relationship, termed TPR and IPR, {{respectively}} {{have been}} the unfailing methods to predict well performance. It is further to determine the schemes on optimising production. The main intention {{of the study is}} to explore TPR and IPR under heating treatment for heavy oil well. Klamono is a mature field which mostly has depleted wells, it produces heavy oil within 18. 5 °API (> 0. 95 g/cc oil density), and therefore, artificial lifting method is necessary. Sucker Road Pump (SRP) and Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) are the most deployed artificial lifting method in this reservoir. To boost the heavy oil production, the application of Electric Downhole Heater (EDH) in Well KLO-X 1 is being studied. Whole Klamono's production is more than 100, 000 blpd within 97 - 99 % water cut. By installing EDH, oil viscosity is decreased hence oil mobility ratio will play a role to decrease water cut. EDH is installed together with the <b>tubing</b> <b>joint</b> to simplify its application in the wellbore. The study shows that EDH application can elevate fluid (mixed oil and brine) temperature. Oil viscosity confirms a reduction from 68 to 46 cP. The gross well production is up to 12. 2 bopd due optimising its outflow performance and reducing 97. 5 to 96. 9 % water cut. The field data gives an incremental of 4. 9 bopd. The computational results only show an attainment of net oil production up to 8. 3 bopd (2 bopd incremental). The EDH works to lessen both density and viscosity as we hypothesised for the mechanism of thermally induced oil production improvement. The evaluation study on its economics aspect exhibits good result that is 1. 4 USD/bbl additional profit margin according to field data despite the challenging annual rig rent cost. Following the field data, the expected net income through analytical model revealed that this project is financially promising...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluid leak}} {{indicator}} (30) for detecting and indicating leaks in visually inaccessible fluid <b>tubing</b> <b>joints</b> (20, 21), {{such as those}} obstructed by insulation (24), includes a bag system (25) and a wicking system (30) surrounding or wrapping the joints (20, 21) under the visual obstructing material (24). Leaking fluid is collected in the bag (25) or on the wicking material (34) where it is conducted along the wicking material (34) to a visibly accessible capturing transparent indicator bulb (35) for providing a visual indication of the leak without requiring a chemical change in the capturing indicator bulb (35) ...|$|R
5000|$|Drain rods are {{plumbing}} equipment used {{to attempt to}} unblock drains and sewers. The set normally consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge <b>tubing.</b> <b>Jointing</b> of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have securing pins through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having cadmium plating for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A captive threaded nut then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|R

40|$|The Archibald {{colorimetric}} {{procedure for}} determination of uric acid has been adapted for automation. The major differences {{from the original}} manual procedure after sodium hydroxidetreatment of the serum sample are neutralization with hydrochlork acid and dialysisof the serum instead of precipitation to remove protein. At the rate of 40 samples per hour, the automated procedure shows good correlation with the manual procedure. T 0 DATE two colorimetric methods (i, 2) {{for the analysis of}} serum uric acid have been adapted to the AutoAnalyzer and reported. Each of the two methods suffers some disadvantages. With the method in which sodium cyanide is used, there is the constant danger of this reagent spilling from loose or disconnected <b>tubing</b> <b>joints.</b> Furthermore, in some laboratories there is the problem of disposal of reagent mix-tures with the possible danger of poisonous gas formation. In the second method, in which carbonate is used, the desired sensitivity is lacking and the suggested effective rate of analysis (20 samples per hour) is relatively slow in comparison to other automated methods now used in the clinical chemistry laboratory. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an adaptation of the Archi-bald method (3, 4) for the automated determination of uric acid. This adaptation was made with the minimum of changes in technic and chemistry. The procedure described, therefore, still retains the re-liability and the capacity to remove reducing substances in serum as in the original manual method. Tnt addition, the new procedure has the salient features of automatic chemical analysis and dialysis that avoids loss of uric acid incident to precipitation of proteins...|$|R

50|$|Solder {{fittings}} are smooth, {{and easily}} slip onto {{the end of}} a <b>tubing</b> section. The <b>joint</b> is then heated using a torch, and solder is melted into the connection. When the solder cools, it forms a very strong bond which can last for decades. Solder-connected rigid copper is the most popular choice for water supply lines in modern buildings. In situations where many connections must be made at once (such as plumbing of a new building), solder offers much quicker and much less expensive joinery than compression or flare fittings. The term sweating is sometimes used to describe the process of soldering pipes.|$|R
40|$|Mechanically {{pumped fluid}} loops (MPFLs) are {{increasingly}} considered for spacecraft thermal control. A concern for long duration space missions is the leak of fluid leading to performance degradation or potential loop failure. An understanding of leak rate through analysis, {{as well as}} destructive and non-destructive testing, provides a verifiable means to quantify leak rates. The system can be appropriately designed to maintain safe operating pressures and temperatures throughout the mission. Two MPFLs on the Mars Science Laboratory Spacecraft, launched November 26, 2011, maintain the temperature of sensitive electronics and science instruments within a - 40 deg C to 50 deg C range during launch, cruise, and Mars surface operations. With over 100 meters of complex <b>tubing,</b> fittings, <b>joints,</b> flex lines, and pumps, the system must maintain a minimum pressure through all phases of the mission to provide appropriate performance. This paper describes the process of design, qualification, test, verification, and validation of the components and assemblies employed to minimize risks associated with excessive fluid leaks from pumped fluid loop systems...|$|R
5000|$|Some baroque {{trumpets}} {{have been}} made using modern manufacturing methods, not the hand hammered technique exercised by the master craftsmen like Schnitzer, Haas, Hainlein, Ehe, and others. There is evidence, for example, that the bore anomalies of museum originals may favor certain notes, {{making it possible to}} [...] "lip" [...] the out-of-tune notes with greater ease. This characteristic is absent in factory-made instruments, with their geometrically perfect bore.These bore anomalies include (but are not limited to) imperfectly soldered-seam <b>tubing</b> and telescoping <b>joints.</b> Each of the five joints-- crook or bit to 1st yard; 1st yard to distal bow; distal bow to 2nd yard; 2nd yard to proximal bow; and proximal bow to bell section-- represents a [...] "choke-point", the upstream tubing being shrunk to telescope into the expanded downstream ferrule. The slight acoustical perturbations so produced suggest a further eroding of the harmonic series' rigidity and, a consequently greater flexibility available to the player.(As a side note, these joints are friction fit without the use of solder) ...|$|R
50|$|Stopcocks {{are often}} parts of {{laboratory}} glassware such as burettes, separatory funnels, Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography. The stopcock is a smooth tampered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a corresponding ground glass female joint. The stationary female joint is designed {{such that it}} joins two or more pieces of glass tubing. The stopcock has holes bored through it which allow the tubes attached to the female joint to be connected or separated with partial turns of the stopcock. Most stopcocks are solid pieces with linear bores although some are hollow with holes to simple holes that can line up the <b>joints</b> <b>tubing.</b> The stopcock is held together with the female joint with a metal spring, plastic plug retainer, a washer and nut system, {{or in some cases}} vacuum. Stopcocks plugs are generally made out of ground glass or an inert plastic like PTFE. The ground glass stopcocks are greased to create an airtight seal and prevent the glass from fusing. The plastic stopcocks are at most lightly oiled.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{characterized as}} both a membrane probe and a bone ultrafiltration probe has been developed to enable in vivo sampling of interstitial fluid in bone. The probe {{makes it possible to}} measure the concentration of calcium and other constituents of the fluid that may be relevant to bone physiology. The probe could be especially helpful in experimental studies of microgravitational bone loss and of terrestrial bone-loss disease states, including osteoporosis. The probe can be implanted in the bone tissue of a living animal and can be used to extract samples of the interstitial bone fluid from time to time during a long-term study. The probe includes three 12 -cm-long polyacrylonitrile fibers configured in a loop form and attached to polyurethane tubing [inside diameter 0. 025 in. (0. 64 mm), outside diameter 0. 040 in. (1 mm) ]; the attachment is made by use of a 1 -cm-long connecting piece of polyurethane tubing [inside diameter 0. 035 0. 003 in. (0. 89 0. 08 mm), outside diameter 0. 060 0. 003 in. (1. 52 0. 08 mm) ]. At the distal end, a 2 -cm-long piece of polyurethane tubing of the same inner and outer diameters serves as a connector to a hub. A 1 -cm long piece of expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) <b>tubing</b> over the <b>joint</b> between the fibers and the connecting tubing serves as a tissue-in-growth site...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a {{novel model}} is {{presented}} to estimate the thermophysical properties of superheated steam (SHS) in dual-tubing wells (DTW). Firstly, a mathematical model comprised of the mass conservation equation, momentum balance equation and energy balance equation in the integral <b>joint</b> <b>tubing</b> (IJT) and annuli is proposed for concentric dual-tubing wells (CDTW), and in the main tubing (MT) and auxiliary tubing (AT) for parallel dual-tubing wells (PDTW). Secondly, the distribution of temperature, pressure and superheat degree along the wellbores are obtained by finite difference method on space and solved with iteration technique. Finally, based upon the validated model, sensitivity analysis of injection temperature is conducted. The results show that: (1) effect of injection temperature difference between MT and AT on temperature profiles is weak compared with that between the IJT and annuli. (2) Temperature gradient in IJT and annuli near wellhead is larger than that in MT and AT. (3) Superheat degree in both CDTW and PDTW increases {{with the increase in}} injection temperature in IJT and MT, respectively. (4) Superheat degree in IJT and MT decreases rapidly near wellhead, but the superheat degree in annuli and AT has an increase. (5) Thermal radiation and convection are the main ways of heat exchange between MT and AT. This paper gives engineers a novel insight into what is the flow and heat transfer characteristics of SHS in DTW, and provides an optimization method of injection parameters for oilfield.|$|R
40|$|The Adaptive Paddling Program at California Polytechnic State University has {{sponsored}} {{the construction of}} an adaptive kayak seat, the Tide Rider 360, to provide paddlers with disabilities sufficient trunk support while out on the water. In particular, this design focused on providing the least restrictive environment for all users while still providing sufficient lateral, neck, back, and hip support. This seat is intended for use in the quarterly Adaptive Paddling Program to allow people with disabilities to experience the joys of kayaking in the most comfortable and supportive environment possible. The following report details the background research, design development, manufacturing, and testing processes that went into designing this seat. It provides in-depth breakdowns on aspects such as the concept generation and material selection methods in order to prove that this kayak seat meets the requirements of the Adaptive Paddling Program. In particular, this seat was designed for use in marine environments with maximum levels of adjustability, support, and comfort. It was designed to fit to all different types of people in terms of weight, disability, and paddling ability. This kayak seat was manufactured out of aluminum <b>tubing</b> and <b>joints,</b> high density polyethylene sheets, and polyethylene foam. In addition to these materials, we added pre-manufactured wheelchair support components for the lateral supports, headrest, hip supports, and seat base. The total cost for the manufacturing of this prototype came out to be approximately $ 2100 and the final weight was just around 30 pounds. We conducted multiple levels of testing on the kayak seat, including a load test and in-pool assessment. Our load testing proved that the aluminum seat frame experiences minimal deflection and bending when subjected to a constant weight {{for an extended period of}} time. The in-pool testing verified that the seat is able to support a paddler while still allowing them a wide range of motion, if so desired. The prototype as is does have a few shortcomings, such as some hard to reach adjustment bolts, but the Adaptive Paddling Program still feels confident in the ability of this seat and the fulfillment of the preset requirements. We believe that with a few slight modifications to the seat back angle and some additional reach of the supports, this product would be able to change the lives of the participants in the Adaptive Paddling Program...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{pressure}} and temperature of the wet steam are in function relationship. That {{is to say the}} temperature can be obtained when {{the pressure}} is known, which is different from supercritical water. Zhou (2010) and Xu (2011) proposed models for estimating superheated steam flow in the vertical wells and obtained {{the pressure and}} temperature profiles by numerical methods (de Almeida et al. 2017). Xu et al. (2013) added some oil displacement mechanisms of superheated steam to previous models (Fan et al. 2016). Sun et al. (2017 c) proposed an novel model by taking the effect of frictional work on fluid temperature into consideration, which laid a solid foundation for following studies (Sun et al. 2017 d, e). Gu et al. (2015) proposed a basic model for single-phase fluid flow in the horizontal section of the wellbores (Dong et al. 2014, 2016). Sun et al. (2017 f) improved Dong et al.’s model by modifying the energy balance equation. As a result, the scope of application of the multi-component thermal fluid flow model in horizontal wells was extended to a wider range of injection rate. Then, flow behaviors of saturated steam in parallel or concentric dual-tubing wells were revealed by Wei (2015) and Gu (2016). Based mainly on Wei and Gu et al.’s works, Sun et al. (2017 g, h, i) conducted a series of studies on superheated fluid (superheated steam or multi-component thermal fluid) flow in parallel or concentric dual-tubing wells. They found out that heat exchange inside the wellbores has an obvious influence on thermophysical properties of superheated fluid in the integral <b>joint</b> <b>tubing</b> and annuli or in the main tubing and auxiliary tubing.|$|R
