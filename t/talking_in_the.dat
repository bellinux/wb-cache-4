5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

25|$|The interpreter, Sergeant (Sgt) Simon Hamilton-Jewell, Corporal (Cpl) Russ Aston and Lance {{corporal}} (LCpl) Ben Hyde {{moved off}} {{to the police station}} leaving Corporal Paul Long, Corporal Simon Miller and Lance corporal Thomas Keys to stay behind with the vehicles, weapons and body armour. Whilst the RMPs were <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> police station, they heard the gunfire and went outside to investigate. When a crowd had formed and some of them were firing into the air, Sergeant Hamilton-Jewell ordered the Land Rovers into the compound. At this point, some of the Iraqi Police left, promising {{to find out what was}} going on, but it was believed that they were planning an escape. The crowd swelled to between 400 and 600 people then advanced upon the police station after finding out that British soldiers were there. At this time, the Ops Room at Abu Naji were being informed that the six RMPs might still be in Majar al-Kabir by their chain of command. As there had been no communication with the six RMPs, it could not be definitely asserted as to where they were.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Wesley Archer. A plot twist that involved Homer being carried away to an eagle nest and being raised as a baby eagle was suggested for this episode by executive producer James L. Brooks, but they ended up going with Maggie being raised by bears instead. The sequence with Marge and Lisa by the bonfire was originally longer and included a conversation between the two about boys, but it was cut from the episode. In the original script, Homer and Bart were not <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene where they concealed their private parts with mud and moss, but Sam Simon {{thought it would be}} [...] "too funny to leave as a stage direction" [...] and they added dialogue to the scene.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the group}} {{addresses}} social issues including corruption, environmentalism, personal liberty, and Latin American identity.

Author Eunice Rojas cites this {{as an example of}} the group using [...] "the power of music to advance social causes." [...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love. We are talking about the love that elevates and purifies your soul. We are <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of the love that sets you free." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shots at}} the Hooters {{restaurant}} were filmed relatively early in the day, {{and a majority of}} the scenes were improvised by Carell.

[...] The scene where Pam and Kelly discuss wedding plans was particularly difficult to shoot all in one scene, due to the amount of activity going on. John Krasinski later noted that he was impressed that the director and cameramen were able to successfully get the shot. The sequence featuring Michael and Jim <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> break room was made of two composition shots, because Krasinski was laughing [...] "the entire" [...] time. Michael buying Stanley a peach ice tea and telling him that he will [...] "hate it" [...] was entirely improvised.|$|E

500|$|During Cleveland's {{audition}} for The Bachelorette, an unused scene was created that showed both Peter and Cleveland naked, with Peter {{sitting on top}} of Cleveland and bouncing up and down, as if he and Cleveland were engaging in anal sex, but broadcasting standards prohibited the scene. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comments in the DVD commentary that Walter Murphy, who composes much of the music for Family Guy, goes back and forth from standard Family Guy music to Bachelorette-style music during the episode. During the sequence where Brian and Brooke are <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barn, originally, the two horses in the background were intended to begin mating, but the sketch was never used. Nancy Cartwright, voice actor of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, and Michael Bell, voice actor of Chaz Finster on Rugrats, provided their voices for the Snorks reference. The name of Quagmire's cat was originally [...] "Pussy", but broadcasting standards objected. The episode was originally to feature a sequence showing Chris breaking entry into Goldman's Pharmacy in order to destroy the acne medication wearing a Balaclava, but the scene was never shown. The promo features Quagmire in a limo finding the girl of his dreams, but the scene was also cut.|$|E
500|$|LucasArts's game {{producer}} Craig Derrick and {{his team}} conceived {{the idea of the}} remake in 2008. After researching the Monkey Island series' history, they decided to make [...] "something fresh and new while staying true to the original", which resulted in the idea of The Secret of Monkey Island remake. The developers tried to leave much of the original design unchanged. Any changes were intended to achieve the level of immersion desired for the original. To that end, they added details like a pirate ship or pirates <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background of scenes. While the team considered the SCUMM interface revolutionary at the time, LucasArts community manager Brooks Brown noted that it is incompatible with an analog stick, which most consoles use. The designers made the cursor contextual to the game objects as the primary interface. Brown had considered updating the reference to advertise [...] because Loom was not on the market at the time, but concluded that the game would not be the same if such changes were implemented. Prior to the Special Edition release, however, LucasArts announced that Loom, along with other games from its back catalog, would be made available on Steam. Brown stated that the decision to distribute the game online was because [...] "digital downloads have finally gotten going".|$|E

[...] In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney [...] "balanced nicely" [...] with Liz's story, and that Tracy's [...] "had some good moments". In conclusion, Porter wrote [...] "For a show that doesn't always know how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons." [...] TV Guide Magazine’s Sandra Kofler wrote that the [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] song was hilarious, and that it [...] "stole [...] season finale." [...] Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting [...] "he song itself is a hoot, highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone starts <b>talking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a song, you know it's serious.'" [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "sweet and all", and noted that the [...] "Vontella-as-Tyra spoof" [...] was [...] "brilliant." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode [...] "was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy... season of 30 Rock", but added that the finale overall was [...] "maybe average", however, [...] "the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song".|$|E
