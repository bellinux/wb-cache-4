5|$|Ali {{ordered that}} if he died from the wound, Ibn Muljam had to be {{executed}} in retaliation. Otherwise, if he survived, he would decide on how <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him.</b> Ali died two days later on 21 Ramadan 40/30 January 661 (or 19 Ramadan 40/28 January 661) {{at the age of}} 62 or 63, and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation (Qisas) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance to Ali's instruction.|$|E
5|$|Although McCain {{was seriously}} wounded and injured, his captors refused <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him.</b> They beat and interrogated {{him to get}} information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese {{discovered}} {{that his father was}} a high-ranking admiral. His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Isa was demoted in 1987, because Abu Nidal {{believed}} he had become too close to other figures within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, Abu Nidal insisted he remain in the Intelligence Directorate, forcing him to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> with contempt.|$|E

5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him.</b> Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E

5|$|In 1323, Polo was {{confined}} to bed, due to illness. On January 8, 1324, despite physicians' efforts <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him,</b> Polo was on his deathbed. To write and certify the will, his family requested Giovanni Giustiniani, a priest of San Procolo. His wife, Donata, and his three daughters were appointed by him as co-executrices. The church was entitled by law to {{a portion of his}} estate; he approved of this and ordered that a further sum be paid to the convent of San Lorenzo, the place where he wished to be buried. He also set free Peter, a Tartar servant, who may have accompanied him from Asia, and to whom Polo bequeathed 100 lire of Venetian denari.|$|E

5|$|Several years later, Simba grants an {{adolescent}} Kiara's request {{to embark on}} her first hunt, but has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret. Realizing this, Kiara rebels and pursue her hunt outside of the Pride Lands, where she nearly falls victim to a wildfire. Kiara is rescued by Kovu, who returns her to the Pride Lands, which is actually part of Zira's plan to overthrow Simba. Saying that he has left the Outsiders, Kovu asks Simba to let him join his pride. Simba reluctantly accepts, but distrusts Kovu because of his similarities to Scar, and continues <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> ruthlessly. That night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save his father Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff into the stampede.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> as {{an essential}} and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Laura finds Nicky on a {{basement}} table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; {{along the way}} she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is arrested {{for the murder of}} Dr. Ryan.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{he was not}} as steadfast as his father, and was easily swayed by the {{officials}} at court. The early period of his caliphate was dominated by the vizier al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah. A very able man, he was also ambitious; he had plotted to assassinate al-Mu'tadid shortly before the latter's death, and now ruthlessly eliminated any rivals for influence over the new caliph. Thus al-Qasim ordered {{the execution of the}} imprisoned Saffarid ruler, Amr ibn al-Layth, when al-Muktafi, immediately after his arrival in Baghdad asked after his well-being and indicated that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> well. Shortly after, the vizier managed to discredit al-Mu'tadid's loyal commander-in-chief, Badr al-Mu'tadidi. Badr was forced to flee Baghdad but surrendered after being promised a pardon by the vizier's agents, only to be executed on 14 August. A few days later, al-Qasim ordered the arrest of an uncle of the Caliph, Abd al-Wahid, a son of al-Muwaffaq, who never heard from again; and in September 903 al-Husayn ibn Amr al-Nasrani, a Christian secretary, whom al-Muktafi initially favoured and who opposed al-Qasim, was denounced and exiled, his offices being given to al-Qasim's sons, al-Husayn and Muhammad. Al-Qasim even succeeded in having his little daughter betrothed to one of al-Muktafi's infant sons, and his eminent position in the state was highlighted by the award, {{for the first time in}} the Islamic world, of a special honorific title, Wali al-Dawla. In the bureaucratic struggles of the period, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah favoured the Banu'l-Jarrah and resisted the pro-Shi'ite leanings of the Banu'l-Furat. The leading representative of the Banu'l-Furat, Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat, only escaped death due to the vizier's own death in 904. Before his death al-Qasim had nominated as his successors either al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i or Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, but the latter refused the post, and Ali ibn al-Furat quickly gained the favour of al-Abbas al-Jarjara'i and the Caliph.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between the Second Doctor and his predecessor was unclear. In his first story, the Second Doctor referred to his predecessor in the third person {{as if he were a}} completely different person. His companions Ben and Polly are at first unsure how <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> and it is only when a Dalek recognises him that they accept that he is the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986. Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included acupuncturist Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate. Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight. He also became a vegetarian.|$|E

25|$|Almalaf, an Iraqi news source on 15 October 2008, quoted {{sources in}} Lebanon saying Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah had been {{poisoned}} {{the previous week}} {{and that he was}} saved by Iranian doctors who went to Lebanon <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him.</b> The sources told the paper that a particularly poisonous chemical substance was used against the Shi'a militia leader. His medical condition was apparently critical for several days until Iranian doctors came and managed to save his life. Almalaf claimed that the sources believed it was highly likely that the poisoning was an Israeli assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|When Morton {{was stabbed}} and wounded, a nearby whites-only {{hospital}} refused <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him,</b> {{as the city}} had racially segregated facilities. He was transported to a black hospital farther away. When {{he was in the}} hospital, the doctors left ice on his wounds for several hours before attending to his eventually fatal injury. His recovery from his wounds was incomplete, and thereafter he was often ill and easily became short of breath. Morton made a new series of commercial recordings in New York, several reprising tunes from his early years that he discussed in his Library of Congress interviews.|$|E
25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and refused to say anything to the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of how <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him.</b> He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E

25|$|In 1705, Mir Fazlullah {{presented}} Dost Mohammad Khan's regiment to {{the emperor}} Aurangzeb. According to the Khan's rozanmacha (daily diary), Aurangzeb was impressed by him, presented him with two fistful of gold coins, and asked Fazlullah <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> well and give him an appropriate command. In return, Khan conveyed his loyalty to the Emperor. Following this, Khan rose rapidly through the ranks, and {{was assigned to the}} Malwa province in central India. Malwa was politically unstable at the time, and Aurangzeb had been replacing the governors in rapid succession. The Marathas, the Rajput chieftains and Muslim feudal chiefs were agitating for power in and around the region, and the Mughals were facing several revolts.|$|E
25|$|Today these dating {{attempts}} {{are little}} more than a historical curiosity. On the one hand, as the scholarly consensus on Near Eastern ancient history moved towards placing Hammurabi in the late 18th century (or even later), and not the 19th, confessional and evangelical theologians found they had to choose between accepting these identifications or accepting the biblical chronology; most were disinclined to state that the Bible might be in error and so began synchronizing Abram with the empire of Sargon I, and the work of Schrader, Pinches and Scheil fell out of favour. Meanwhile, further research into Mesopotamia and Syria in the second millennium BC undercut attempts to tie Abraham in with a definite century and <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him</b> as a strictly historical figure, and while linguistically not implausible, the identification of Hammurabi with Amraphel is now regarded as untenable.|$|E
25|$|In various respects, {{the history}} of Mirza Ali Mohammed, surnamed the Báb, {{presents}} startling resemblance {{to that of the}} Savior. Claiming descent from an ancient prophet king, he was yet, like Jesus, born in a lowly station; still he was regarded by his followers as the sovereign of his nation and of mankind, whose advent had been long foretold and ardently expected. After leading a life of purity, and uttering words of wisdom, he was put to death, through the hostility of his own government, but by the hands of foreign soldiers; and, before his execution, he was denied by some of his most prominent followers; nay, the very form of contumely with which thy were compelled <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>him,</b> was the same which had been used towards the Savior in the hall of the high priest.|$|E
