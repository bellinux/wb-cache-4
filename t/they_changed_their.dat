5|$|Gojira are a French {{heavy metal}} band from Bayonne. Originally formed as Godzilla in 1996, <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Gojira in 2001. The band's lineup, {{consisting}} of brothers Joe Duplantier (vocals, guitars) and Mario Duplantier (drums), lead guitarist Christian Andreu, and bassist Jean-Michel Labadie, {{has been the}} same since the band's name change.|$|E
5|$|The local {{football}} team is Glastonbury Town F.C. They joined the Western Football League Division Two as Glastonbury in 1919 {{and won the}} Western Football League title three times in their history. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Glastonbury Town in 2003. For the 2010–11 season, they {{were members of the}} Somerset County Football League Premier Division.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Kentucky {{had wanted}} {{the jury to}} force NASCAR to grant the {{speedway}} a Sprint Cup Series event but in 2007 <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> demand to instead force the France family to sell either NASCAR or ISC. The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a {{farm near}} Örebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. They {{traveled}} to Minneapolis, Minnesota to join their brother Carl Jakobson. There <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> last name to Wallen to distinguish themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they heard was booming. Rika {{took a job as}} a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} a more natural sound. As the band took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|U2 {{contacted}} the show about doing a guest spot, {{rather than the}} other way around. The writers immediately wrote them one, in case <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> minds. The band's head of Principal Management Paul McGuinness and Susie Smith, an employee of Principal Management, also make brief appearances in the episode. U2's drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. appears in the episode, although he has no dialogue. Steve Martin guest stars as Ray Patterson.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|Gojira {{was formed}} in 1996 by Joe and Mario Duplantier, Christian Andreu, and Alexandre Cornillon in their {{hometown}} of Ondres. Gojira's music combines elements of death metal, groove metal, thrash metal, and progressive metal. The band started touring and recording under the name Godzilla and released their demos Victim, Possessed, Saturate, and Wisdom Comes in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, respectively. After touring, supporting Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Impaled Nazarene, and Immortal in September 1999, legal problems forced Godzilla to change their name. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Gojira, the rōmaji spelling of the fictional monster Godzilla. Their debut album Terra Incognita was released under the new name in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name because of the altered line-up, and to avoid being mistaken for a satanic metal band.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Regiment faced {{discrimination}} {{during this}} period. The anti-miscegenation laws in California {{meant that the}} soldiers were banned from marrying non-Filipino women; those soldiers who wished to marry in this way were transported to Gallup, New Mexico, as New Mexico had repealed its anti-miscegenation law after the Civil War. Soldiers of the Regiment faced discrimination in Marysville while visiting from neighboring Camp Beale, as the local businesses refused to serve Filipinos. This was later remedied by the Regiment's commander, who informed the Chamber of Commerce that they were failing {{to cooperate with the}} Army, at which point <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> business practices. Further instances of discrimination against soldiers of the Regiment were also reported in Sacramento and San Francisco, where they were mistaken for Japanese Americans.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. <b>They</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had not passed that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E

5|$|The Lafayette Afro Rock Band {{was formed}} as the Bobby Boyd Congress in 1970, in homage to their {{original}} vocalist Bobby Boyd. Upon deciding that the funk scene in the United States was too saturated for them to viably compete in, they relocated to France in 1971; with Bobby Boyd splitting from the group to pursue a musical career in America, they renamed themselves 'Soul Congress', then 'Ice'. After regular performances in Paris' Barbès district—an area made up primarily of North African immigrants—they {{caught the eye of}} producer Pierre Jaubert and became the house session band at his Parisound studio. The influence of their surroundings led Ice to increasingly weave African rhyme schemes, textures, and beat tendencies in their original funk style, and as such <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Lafayette Afro Rock Band following the 1972 release of the poorly produced Each Man Makes His Own Destiny.|$|E
5|$|Football {{had been}} played at St James' Park {{as early as}} 1880, the ground being {{occupied}} by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End F.C. in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End F.C. in 1892, before <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Newcastle United. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, {{and the rest of the}} ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity all-seater stadium. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,420. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,420 people, but club owner Mike Ashley would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.|$|E

25|$|Banbury United F.C. {{was first}} formed as Spencer Villa in 1931 and their home matches played at Middleton Road. At {{this time it}} was {{essentially}} a works club. In 1934, <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to Banbury Spencer and moved to the Spencer Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{known as}} the Phoenix Coyotes upon their arrival, <b>they</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name to the Arizona Coyotes in 2014.
