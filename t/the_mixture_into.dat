25|$|Continuous {{blending}} is {{the process}} of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> a storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Goodfellow was an {{innovative}} physician {{who was forced}} to experiment with differing methods than those utilized by physicians in more civilized eastern practices. He pioneered the idea of treating tuberculosis patients by exposing them to Arizona's dry climate. Goodfellow performed the first appendectomy in the Arizona Territory. During 1891 at St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson, he performed what many {{consider to be the}} first perineal prostatectomy, an operation he developed to treat bladder problems by removing the enlarged prostate. He traveled extensively across the United States over the next decade, training other physicians to perform the procedure. Among these was Dr. Hugh Young, a well-known and respected urology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Goodfellow completed 78 operations and only two patients died, a remarkable level of success for the time period. He was among the first surgeons anywhere, let alone on the frontier of the United States, who used spinal anesthetic, which he improvised by crushing cocaine crystals in spinal fluid and reinjecting <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the patient's spine.|$|E

After leaving the drugs to {{macerate}} for three nights, take them out {{and put them in}} the sun to dry out. (Then) again take the aforesaid liquor and steep (the seven drugs) in it for three nights. Once more draw off (the wine) from them {{and put them in the}} sun (and continue this alternative steeping in the wine and drying them) until the wine is exhausted; then stop putting them out to dry. Pound them in an iron mortar and put them through a fine sieve to reduce them to powder. Then take white honey and mix the powder with it for making pills. In the morning, facing East, roll two pills the size of a small pea; then increase this by one pill (each day) to ten or more. This regimen cures third-degree fever within the belly, it truly makes the breath rise up in such a way that the heart and breast are freed of all obstruction, coagulates the flesh and skin, makes the body light and produces a halo around it. When a whole dose has been taken, the cereal Worms die; when the Worms are dead the Corpses dry out; when they are dry, they drop down by themselves. This has to be done several times, not restricting oneself to a single dose. (tr. Maspero 1981: 336) ...|$|E
60|$|He splashed another white smear {{upon his}} jacket, and rubbed {{it with his}} hand before he poured some of <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the hot spider, out of which he {{presently}} shook {{what appeared to be}} a very light pancake. Three or four more followed in quick succession, and then he poured water on to the green tea and handed Alison a plate containing two flapjacks and some pork. She found them palatable. Even the desiccated apples, which from want of soaking were somewhat leathery, did not come amiss, and the flavor of the wood smoke failed to spoil the strong green tea. Then Thorne poured a little hot water over the plates, and as there was no vessel that would hold them, she overruled his objections when she volunteered to go down and wash them thoroughly in the creek. When she came back she found that he had made up a clear fire and spread out a blanket as a seat for her.|$|E

Considering these properties, a new method for blind separation of linear instantaneous mixtures of mutually uncorrelated, nonstationary, real sources is proposed {{which is based}} on spectral decorrelation of the sources. It allows the existing timedomain algorithms developed for stationary, temporally correlated sources to be applied to nonstationary, temporally uncorrelated sources just by mapping <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> frequency domain. The method sets no constraint on the piecewise stationarity of the sources, unlike most of previously reported methods. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{presents}} new blind separation {{methods for}} moving average (MA) convolutive mixtures of independent MA processes.

We prove the relevance of this approach by mapping <b>the</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> linear instantaneous ones. Test results are presented for artificial colored signals and speech signals.
