5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, {{it occurred to him that}} integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to get it running.|$|E
25|$|With {{their current}} album {{suddenly}} withdrawn and their follow-up rejected, Badfinger spent {{the early months}} of 1975 <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to proceed under the unclear legal situation. Their March 1975 salary cheques did not clear, and the April cheques never arrived. Panic set in, especially for Ham, who had recently bought a £30,000 house in Woking, Surrey, and whose girlfriend was expecting a child. According to Jackson, the band tried to continue without Polley's involvement by contacting booking agents and prospective managers throughout London, but they were routinely declined because of their restrictive contracts with Polley and impending legal actions. Ham reportedly tried on many occasions to contact Polley by telephone during {{the early months of}} 1975, but was never able to reach him.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the episode, the producers [...] "agonized" [...] over the teaser—due {{to the fact that}} it featured the death of a small child—as well as the darkness of the entire episode. Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to [...] "soften the impact". Although the episode's filming went along smoothly, the final cut [...] "didn't pass muster". Spotnitz explained that Carter [...] "spent a lot of time in the editing room <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to make this more terrifying." [...] Spotnitz later noted that Carter's dedication impacted his work ethic and proved that something could be so [...] "much better [...] if you didn't give up." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul Fedor was filmed between October 31 and November 1, 2006. During {{an interview with}} MTV News, Lee said, [...] "There's the me in all white and it's really wintry, and then there's the all-in-black Amy {{under the surface of}} the water of this lake in the forest. So it's the happiness and the sorrow and we're almost singing to each other, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> both of us can work." [...] She added that the video was not [...] "so-in-your-face" [...] in order to be made more literal, but expressed her opinion that it's [...] "all about touching somebody and I hope it does that". For the video, fake snow and trees were used along with various other objects which according to the video's scenic coordinator, were supposed to create a [...] "frozen, gothic, cemetery feel". For the scenes filmed in water, a hydraulic lift was used with which Lee could easily sink and the lake water was colored black.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, the Springfield {{residents}} try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the [...] "people ball", was very difficult to animate, and it [...] "almost gave [...] a migraine" [...] determining how to implement it in the episode. While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to animate the [...] "people ball", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the Simpsons animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the [...] "people ball", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the [...] "people ball" [...] by hand would have [...] "murdered" [...] the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the [...] "people ball" [...] was [...] "extremely interesting", [...] although it has never been used again in the series. The [...] "master drawing" [...] of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple of days to draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.|$|E

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers {{are still trying to}} figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> much money he has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and {{make it more difficult to}} gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court. Also, the constitutional right to a [...] "speedy trial" [...] only applies to criminal cases according to the Sixth Amendment, not civil cases.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, several prominent pastors publicly defended Mark Driscoll, including mega-church pastor Rick Warren, author of The Purpose Driven Life, and Gateway Church's founding pastor Robert Morris. At the 2014 Gateway Conference, Morris told the audience that he counseled Mark Driscoll directly, and that media reports were largely untrue. Morris cited recent media reports of lead pastor Steven Furtick of Elevation Church as experiencing similar coverage. At the conference, Mark Driscoll was invited up to the stage where he told the audience that he received death threats and that his children allegedly had rocks thrown at them. Driscoll stated that [...] "I'm just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> {{to be a good}} pastor to my family first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tim Burke and Tim Alexander {{were the}} visual effects {{supervisors}} for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, [...] "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of {{not making this}} into a zombie movie, so we were constantly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of {{it came down to}} their movement – they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style." [...] He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't {{have anything to do with}} who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E
2500|$|Problems {{with both}} the Metal Blade and Def American labels made it {{impossible}} for Trouble to achieve large commercial success. Even though their music videos were aired on MTV in both the U.S. and Europe, Manic Frustration was the only album that sold close to 100,000 copies. However, Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic wrote that [...] "their preservation efforts nevertheless rescued metal's original blueprint from disuse, and carved it in granite for subsequent exploration by each new generation of doom bands that followed." [...] It was said that Trouble took up where Black Sabbath had left off after their split with vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Psalm 9 and The Skull are often cited as the cornerstones of doom metal as well influencing other bands of the uprising metal movement during the mid-1980s. [...] A famous story states that James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett from Metallica entered Trouble's stage after a concert, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> their amplifiers were set to produce their unique sound.|$|E

Newman would be the Twins thirdbase coach from 2002 to 2005. In April 2003, Kirby Puckett {{had fallen out of}} favor with the public after a Sports Illustrated article chronicled a personal life much different from his public persona. Newman sympathized with his long-time friend, saying, [...] "I'm scared to death for him. I'm scared because of his health and about his frame of mind. He's a baseball man and the game that gave him everything -- the game that got him out of the Chicago ghetto -- is gone from him now. The people who loved him don't love him anymore.

2500|$|Aeroperú Airlines Flight 603 (2 October 1996) – The {{maintenance}} {{crew had}} taped over the static ports before washing the plane, and then failed {{to remove the}} tape. This resulted in the flight instruments, such as the altimeter and airspeed indicator, failing while the plane was flying through dense fog at 1 AM over the ocean. They had a confused sense of where they were and contradictory information about altitude and airspeed. The co-pilot began reading through the manual, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to solve the problem. Meanwhile, all sorts of warnings were going off, both because the plane thought that the instrument readings were consistent with various emergencies and because the crew's actions, based on false data, were creating problems. The pilot communicated with the air traffic controller, who kept telling {{them that they were}} at 9,700 feet. Actually, they were flying dangerously low, as indicated by the repeated [...] "Too low. Terrain!" [...] warning. The pilot decided to descend and ended up crashing into the ocean, killing all passengers and crew. Air traffic control had been relaying the faulty altitude information transmitted by the plane's transponder.|$|E
2500|$|In late April 1994, {{the band}} {{relocated}} to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, but recording was disrupted because Stipe {{suffered from a}} tooth abscess that required medical attention. Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production had moved to Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, California, the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told Rolling Stone, [...] "We're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> raw to leave it {{and how much to}} studiofy it." [...] At the same time, Stipe was still writing when the band was supposed to be mixing the record. Tension arose between the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time. Tensions came to a head when the group was recording at Louie's Clubhouse, Litt's home studio in Los Angeles, where years later Stipe recalled, [...] "We broke up [...] [...] [...] We reached the point where none of us could speak to each other, and we were in a small room, and we just said 'Fuck off' and that was it." [...] The group had a meeting to resolve its issues; Mills told Rolling Stone, [...] "We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven't been doing very well lately." ...|$|E
