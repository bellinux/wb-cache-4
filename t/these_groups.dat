5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E

5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E

5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{a survey of the}} study on the stable rank of group C*-algebras of finitely generated, torsion free, two-step {{nilpotent}} groups.

5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once suggested that they appeared before the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E

5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> {{even though they were}} only 5 percent of the population.

5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} <b>group,</b> <b>these</b> chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with <b>these</b> functional <b>groups.</b> <b>These</b> include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group.

5|$|An {{important}} {{branch of}} the central apparatus, {{from the point of}} view of day-to-day operational diplomatic guidance, is the executive diplomatic division. The nature of activities engaged in by these divisions is determined by their territorial and functional characteristics.

5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They also tend to be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of <b>these</b> <b>groups,</b> circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among <b>these</b> <b>groups,</b> even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the concept}} of a group of {{coherent}} contingencies is formulated and demonstrated. <b>These</b> <b>group</b> properties include static and dynamic group properties. A scheme for identifying groups of coherent contingencies from a large contingency list is also developed. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate groups of coherent contingencies and the associated <b>group</b> properties. <b>These</b> <b>group</b> properties can have a variety of practical applications; in particular, they can be explored and incorporated into the development of power system analysis, computation and control.

5|$|Classification {{into higher}} taxa for <b>these</b> <b>groups</b> {{has been and}} remains problematic. A phylogenetic study {{suggests}} the Polyplacophora form a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora. Additionally, it suggests a sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda. Tentaculita may also be in Mollusca (see Tentaculites).|$|E
5|$|Examples and {{applications}} of groups abound. A {{starting point is}} the group Z of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.|$|E
5|$|Extremophile archaea {{are members}} of four main {{physiological}} groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. <b>These</b> <b>groups</b> are not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some archaea belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.|$|E
