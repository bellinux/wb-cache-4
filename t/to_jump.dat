Bart's attempt <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> over Springfield Gorge is a {{reference}} to Knievel's 1974 attempt <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> Snake River Canyon at Twin Falls, Idaho, with a Skycycle X-2. Bart appearing at Springfield Gorge in the distance is based on Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> on the victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{benefits}} of endowment destruction documented by Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2014), and the related point that rising consumption can lower habits, are fragile. Both issues result from one way of discretely approximating the underlying continuous time model, or of adapting it <b>to</b> <b>jumps.</b> Other ways of calculating the discrete time approximation or extending the model <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> easily overturn the result, while making no difference to the model’s description of asset prices and quantities. The calculation does however lead to an important lesson for how to extend the model <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> so as <b>to</b> avoid endowment-destruction puzzles. The affair also allows useful reflection on the use of policy predictions in evaluating the predictive value of economic models. ∗Harvard University and NBE...|$|R

5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

5|$|In a subplot, Kramer tells Jerry {{about his}} suicidal friend Newman who {{repeatedly}} threatens {{to kill himself}} by jumping off the apartment building. When he does jump, he jumps from the second floor and survives, much to Kramer's amusement.

5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity <b>to</b> <b>jump.</b> Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

40|$|High {{frequency}} {{financial data}} {{allows us to}} learn more about volatility and jumps. One of the key techniques developed in the literature {{in recent years has been}} bipower variation, which estimates time-varying volatility robustly <b>to</b> <b>jumps.</b> We improve the scope and efficiency of bipower variation by the use of a more sophisticated exploitation of high frequency data. This suggests very significant improvements in the power of jump tests. We extend this analysis to the multivariate case, delivering a simple positive semi-definite estimate of the quadratic variation of prices which is robust <b>to</b> <b>jumps...</b>|$|R

5|$|On June 1, 1996, Helmsley {{appeared}} on {{an episode of}} Superstars in a match against Marty Garner. When he attempted to perform the Pedigree, Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> up with the move, causing him to land squarely {{on top of his}} head and suffer neck damage. Garner sued the WWF, eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show.|$|E

30|$|On {{platinum}} {{squared log}} returns, {{all of the}} tests used suggest LM as all the P values are less than 0.01. Note that the differenced aggregated variances method violates the condition 0 <H< 1. This {{should not be a}} concern as its main purpose is to distinguish nonstationarity due <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> (H 0.5) <b>to</b> that due to actual trend (H≫ 0.5). So in this case, trend is not due <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> in the data. It is clear that platinum squared returns have high persistence and it appears they could be explained by a fractionally integrated model.|$|R
