5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to a Bad Man for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} off-screen by singing and dancing.|$|E
5|$|Holtzmann {{initially}} wanted Cole Porter {{to write}} the score, but he declined. She was going to approach Noël Coward next, but happened to meet Dorothy Hammerstein (Oscar's wife) in Manhattan. Holtzmann told Dorothy Hammerstein that she wanted Rodgers and Hammerstein to create a show for Lawrence, {{and asked her to}} see that her husband read a book that Holtzmann would send over. In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical. Dorothy Hammerstein had known Gertrude Lawrence since 1925, when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> appeared in André Charlot's London Revue of 1924 on Broadway and on tour in North America.|$|E
5|$|The 1977 final was {{the first}} time Liverpool and Borussia Mönchengladbach had reached the showpiece match. The clubs had faced each other before in the final of a European competition; the 1973 UEFA Cup Final. A match which Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate. Despite this being both clubs first European Cup final <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> won European competitions. In {{addition}} to their UEFA Cup victory over Borussia, Liverpool had won the previous season's UEFA Cup, beating Club Brugge 4–3 on aggregate.

5|$|Okafor and Alexander vied {{for a host}} {{of local}} and {{national}} player of the year awards, with each winning multiple national player of the year awards. Young and Curie were both in the Marist Class 4A sectional in the 2014 IHSA playoffs and could have met again in the round of sixteen on March 14 if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> won three regional contests. Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, Curie remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in eligibility rules. On March 4, Curie lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out in the final minute of regulation time. Curie trailed 13–2 early and led 47–32 midway through the third quarter. Curie starters Josh and Joseph Stamps were ineligible for IHSA play as was Malik Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles are {{the only}} act to have four Christmas number ones, three {{consecutively}} starting from 1963. On two occasions, 1963 and 1967, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> the Christmas number one and the number two, the only act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts. Cliff Richard has spent four Christmasses at number one; two as a solo act, one with The Shadows and one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the record of having three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998. Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one {{as a member of}} The Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls. The loan guarantee would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the loan guarantee. On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the loan guarantee. While Oliver stated the loan guarantee would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that the loan guarantee was finalized. In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John's and Halifax on December 17, 2012, Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development.|$|E

Though Castagnoli would return to team with Jaggi and Roudin, Swiss Money Holding being billed as a 3-man tag team, his continuing involvement with Chikara (and later Ring of Honor) resulted in Jaggi mostly teaming with Roudin for the next few years. Jaggi would continue to win titles with both men, however, appearances by all three members were rare.|$|E

25|$|This {{message from}} the Lombard king had the desired effect; Christophorus and Sergius began to suspect their associates, who in turn rapidly {{abandoned}} them. Both were reluctant to leave the city, but eventually both {{made their way to}} the Pope during the night. The next day Stephen was allowed to return to the city, while Christophorus and Sergius were left in Lombard hands. Negotiations to secure their release were unsuccessful, and before the day was out, Afiarta arrived with his partisans.

25|$|Home draws in the Sixth Round {{for both}} teams ensured that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> been drawn {{at home in}} every round of the competition, with Manchester United hosting Chelsea at Old Trafford and Newcastle hosting Everton at St James' Park. This time it was Newcastle who only needed one match to {{progress}} to the semi-finals, beating Everton 4–1 with goals from Temur Ketsbaia (2), Georgios Georgiadis and Alan Shearer. Meanwhile, Manchester United were unable to make their numerical advantage count against Chelsea after Roberto Di Matteo was sent off, before Paul Scholes was sent off himself for Manchester United.

Following her graduation from Johns Hopkins University, she decided to pursue a career in medicine and enrolled in the Chicago School of Medicine in 1995.

Indeed, it was Dasch who approached the FBI, offering to turn the men in, which he then did. Burger was part of the plot to turn on the others and cooperated with the FBI extensively.

25|$|Among the few {{revisions}} Devil's Due instituted was {{the expansion}} of Cobra Commander's origin. After his brother's death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes {{to the house of}} a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>both</b> experienced: years before, the judge had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander's brother Dan, who ran a veteran's hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Realizing where his anger had taken him, Snake Eyes refused to kill the man and walked away. Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.|$|E
