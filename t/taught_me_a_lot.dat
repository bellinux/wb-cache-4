500|$|Roshan then {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) {{in which he}} had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E

Jenner {{was one of the}} two partners in Blackhill Management, and had been producing since the late 1960s, having worked with Kevin Ayers and David Bedford among others. Although Jenner was the experienced producer at The Workhouse, in practice he left most of the production for New Boots and Panties!! to his young protégée Latham, who had joined the studio four years previously and who also engineered the album, with Walton carrying out production duties on those occasions when Latham was unavailable. Latham later recalled that Jenner's technical input on the album had been minimal and that he had more of an overseeing role: [...] "Peter would sit there rolling joints all day and I'd do all the bloody work, but in fairness I also have to say that he <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> awful <b>lot.</b> He wasn't particularly hands-on, but he would always say things like, 'Laurie, are you sure the bass drum's loud enough? Maybe you should nudge it a bit.' It was always the bass drum or the bass, and if you think about it, the rhythm section is what really defines that record ... I think Peter was really undervalued in the end. He recognised that the bass drum and bass were potent, very integral ingredients of the overall sound - the idiosyncratic, mad Cockney-type thing on top of this quite slick, funky sort of rhythm section. And he was also very good at making sure that Ian was on the ball in terms of his vocals." ...|$|R

In his teenage years, Sheen was involved with the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and, later, the National Youth Theatre of Wales. [...] "It was a brilliant youth theatre", Sheen has said, [...] "and it <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> not only <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about acting, but also about work ethic; it was very disciplined." [...] He was influenced by the performances of Laurence Olivier and the writings of theatre critic Kenneth Tynan—"the combination of those two things kind of blew my head off." [...] Sheen was educated at Blaenbaglan Primary School, Glan Afan Comprehensive School and, finally, Neath Port Talbot College where he sat A-levels in English, Drama and Sociology. He considered studying English at university but instead decided to attend drama school. He moved to London in 1988 to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having spent the previous year working in a Welsh fast food restaurant called Burger Master to earn money. Sheen was granted the Laurence Olivier Bursary by The Society of London Theatre in his second year at RADA. He graduated in 1991 with a BA in Acting.|$|R

A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming with my friends up in our attic from the time I was in the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. You could hardly tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times."

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking.
