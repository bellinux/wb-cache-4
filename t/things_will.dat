25|$|All I ask {{of you is}} one thing... I {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing <b>things</b> <b>will</b> happen. I'm telling you, amazing <b>things</b> <b>will</b> happen.|$|E
25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative <b>things</b> <b>will</b> happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference {{is that we are}} in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, the Marine Corps {{solicited}} {{a request}} for a new tropical material variant of the MCCUU. They are looking to purchase 35,000 sets of uniforms, that among other <b>things</b> <b>will</b> dry faster than the fabric used on the MCCUU.|$|E
5000|$|To declare {{something}} satisfactory satisfying is {{to assert}} that it meets specifiable conditions. It is, in effect, a judgment that the thing 'will do'. It involves a prediction; it contemplates {{a future in which}} the <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> continue to serve; it will do. It asserts a consequence the <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> actively institute, it will do." ...|$|R

5000|$|Intensional {{attributes}} can resemble, but are {{not identical}} to, the properties perceived by the five senses. Attributes are names of properties. When, even partially, the properties of a thing match the attributes of that thing {{in the mind of}} the one making the judgment, the <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be said to have [...] "value". When they completely correspond, the <b>thing</b> <b>will</b> be called [...] "good". These are basic ideas in value science.|$|R
25|$|When Beneatha becomes distraught at {{the loss}} of the money, she is upbraided by Joseph for her materialism. She {{eventually}} accepts his point of view that <b>things</b> <b>will</b> get better with a lot of effort, along with his proposal of marriage and his invitation to move with him to Nigeria to practice medicine.|$|E
25|$|Internet-of-things devices {{additionally}} {{will benefit}} from the stateless address auto-configuration present in IPv6, as it reduces the configuration overhead on the hosts, and the IETF 6LoWPAN header compression. To a large extent, the future of the Internet of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> not be possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently, the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future.|$|E
25|$|He {{inferred}} {{that persons}} desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental {{images of the}} things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the things, and the images of the <b>things</b> <b>will</b> denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and the images respectively as a wax writing-tablet and the letters written upon it.|$|E

25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned burnt-out buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back and watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe <b>things</b> <b>will</b> start to change.|$|E
25|$|Note, too, {{that some}} {{nominally}} bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented PowerPC processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian {{from the point}} of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> apply to I/O devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.|$|E
25|$|To {{make things}} a little more interesting, each team, no matter what type of {{exchange}} they are doing, has to perform their exchange in the distance of two pits. The action of slowing {{is not part of}} the exchange, but the first rider is not allowed to begin getting off the bike until one pit ahead of their team's and the second rider must have complete control of the bike by the end of the team's pit. For bike-to-bike exchanges, the second person CANNOT move until tagged by the first person and the first person MUST stop before end of her team's pit. Failure to do either of these <b>things</b> <b>will</b> result in a penalty for the team.|$|E

25|$|Atli {{discusses}} matters with Guðrún. She {{tells him}} that <b>things</b> <b>will</b> go badly for him unless he kills her too. He tries to console her by promising precious gifts and she pretends to relent, asking Atli for a great ale-feast to commemorate her brothers. Guðrún then kills their two sons and has the unsuspecting Atli use their heads as drinking vessels and eat their roasted hearts. Later Guðrún kills Atli {{with the aid of}} Hniflungr, son of Högni. The final part of the poem consists of exchanges between Guðrún and Atli. Guðrún recalls her glorious past when she went harrying with Sigurðr and her brothers. Atli recalls his marriage proposal to Guðrún and how she was never content in their marriage, despite all their riches. In the end he asks Guðrún to give him an honorable burial and she agrees. She then attempts suicide and fails. The poem ends on a note that any man who begets such offspring as Gjúki's is fortunate.|$|E
25|$|Bart D. Ehrman {{argues that}} {{different}} parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons. Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. Apocalyptic parts, including the New Testament, see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and <b>things</b> <b>will</b> be set right.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{a hormone}} which helps {{regulate}} glucose {{levels in the}} body. When blood glucose is high, insulin is released from the Islets of Langerhans. Insulin, among other <b>things,</b> <b>will</b> then facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells via increased expression and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT-4. Under conditions of exercise, however, blood sugar levels are not necessarily high, and insulin is not necessarily activated, yet muscles are still able to bring in glucose. AMPK seems to be responsible in part for this exercise-induced glucose uptake. Goodyear et al. observed that with exercise, the concentration of GLUT-4 was increased in the plasma membrane, but decreased in the microsomal membranes, suggesting that exercise facilitates the translocation of vesicular GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane. While acute exercise increases GLUT-4 translocation, endurance training will increase {{the total amount of}} GLUT-4 protein available. It has been shown that both electrical contraction and AICAR treatment increase AMPK activation, glucose uptake, and GLUT-4 translocation in perfused rat hindlimb muscle, linking exercise-induced glucose uptake to AMPK. Chronic AICAR injections, simulating some of the effects of endurance training, also increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein in the muscle cell.|$|E

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E
500|$|In the November 3, 1970, general election, Hart handily won a {{third term}} with 67percent of the vote to her 33percent.

500|$|Green is {{the color}} most {{commonly}} associated in the U.S. and Europe with springtime, freshness, and hope. Green {{is often used to}} symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality. [...] In Ancient Egypt; the god Osiris, king of the underworld, was depicted as green-skinned. Green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime; hope represents the faith that <b>things</b> <b>will</b> improve after a period of difficulty, like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season.|$|E

500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode, and Brad Anderson directed it. Pinkner has stated that the first six episodes of season one served as a prologue, and that the following episodes, beginning with [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones", would be the [...] "next chapter" [...] in the story. Pinkner further described the episode as [...] "foundational," [...] as it will set up [...] "a lot of <b>things</b> <b>will</b> be set up which will come to pay off {{over the next several}} weeks".|$|E
500|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music {{commented that}} Barely Real was [...] "on first hearing, slightly soporific and listless, but it rewards repeated listening with its depth and emotional texture." [...] Ned Raggett (AllMusic) gave the album {{a rating of}} {{four and a half}} stars out of five, explaining that [...] "Those put off by earlier Codeine CDs won't want to continue; those taken by the band's way of doing <b>things</b> <b>will</b> happily embrace it." [...] The Numero Group's reissue received positive reviews from Spin and Pitchfork Media, with Pitchfork declaring that after The Frigid Stars LP, the EP [...] "felt masterful in its compression of what we'd come to expect from them." ...|$|E

As Nico confronts Petra, George tries to stop the Grand Master, {{arriving}} {{in time to see}} the Grand Master absorb the energy at the site, turning him into a dragon and causing the ground beneath them to collapse. George finds a sword in the cavern he lands in, which he uses to slay the dragon and save the world. [...] As Nico arrives to congratulate him, Petra dying from the dragon's death, George tosses the sword into the floodwaters, as the pair wonder how <b>things</b> <b>will</b> be in the future.|$|E
