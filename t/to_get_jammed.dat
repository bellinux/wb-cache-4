The cabin tables {{having been}} removed, {{and rows of}} seats {{placed in front of}} the stage, the men were {{admitted}} from the deck, to which they had been expelled an hour previous in order not to impede preliminary arrangements. There was great joking, of course, as they took their seats and criticised the fittings up. David Mizzle was of opinion that the foot-lights [...] "wos oncommon grand", which was an unquestionable fact, for they consisted of six tin lamps filled with seal-oil, from the wicks of which rose a compound of yellow flame and smoke that had a singularly luminous effect. Amos Parr guessed that the curtain would be certain sure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> at the first haul, and several of the others were convinced that O'Riley would stick his part in one way or another. However, an end was put to all remarks, and expectation raised on tiptoe by the ringing of a small hand-bell, and immediately thereafter a violent pulling at the curtain which concealed the stage; but the curtain remained immovable (they always do on such occasions), and a loud whispering was heard behind the scenes.|$|E

After tying her apron {{over her head and}} {{to the back of the}} chair, he tries to reach a jar of jam on the top shelf of the pantry. After several futile attempts, he gives up. His {{attention}} is now attracted by a tramp at the window. Buster beckons the fellow to come in through the window, and asks "Weary Willie" <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>jam</b> for him. The tramp secures the jam, he places the jar on the table, and proceeds to enjoy the sweets, but neglects to give Buster his share. Whereupon Buster angrily gets up from the table, shakes his finger threateningly at the tramp and goes out, but almost immediately comes back with his mamma and his dog Tige. Buster's mamma is greatly shocked at the sight, while Buster now sets Tige on the tramp, and in the melee Bridget wakes up, and falls over backwards, chair and all. Buster's mamma releases Bridget from her predicament, and the tramp, with Tige holding on to his coat- tails, makes a hasty retreat through the window. Bridget succeeds in getting hold of her broom and helps him a little. Buster is rewarded by his mamma for getting rid of the tramp, and is given permission to eat all the jam he wants" [...] Edison films catalog, no. 288, July 1906. Duration: 1 : 43 at 16 fps.

By May 2006, the tracking of their debut album began, with Sylencer recruiting drummer Kevin Talley, and lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski to round out the recording lineup. As the majority of the album was recorded by years end, hard economic times started to befall the band.

5000|$|Her 1986 album Control is {{important}} to the development of R&B for a number of reasons. The primary producers of Control, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, and Jackson herself, crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility. Richard J. Ripani, The New Blue Music, 2006 Control is widely considered to be the breakthrough in Jackson's career, establishing her independence and dominance in the realm of popular music. In The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock'n'roll (1996) author Simon Reynolds wrote that [...] "Janet Jackson became a superstar with the immaculately designed soft-core feminism of Control." [...] Jet magazine commented that although the Jackson family's musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience, Control was the turning point at which [...] "her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar. Control showcased Janet as a person who was firmly and finally in control of her own life." [...] Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "Previously, she had recorded two unsophisticated, kiddie soul albums.

40|$|Much of {{a modern}} person 2 ̆ 7 s day is spent trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from point A to point B. So, too, in the cell, much time and energy is {{expended}} on shuttling organelles, protein complexes, and mRNA, called “cargos,” from point A to point B. We know that vehicle traffic slows down when roads <b>get</b> <b>jammed</b> with high-volume congestion. The traffic analogy begs the question: Do cellular highways <b>get</b> <b>jammed?</b> This is the question being probed by Leduc et al. in PNAS (1). Efficient cellular transport is made along “cellular highways” {{in the form of}} a cytoskeletal network of proteinacous filaments called microtubules (2, 3). The microtubules crisscross the cell in a radial array to connect distal regions. The cell has “motor proteins” to traverse the highways and carry cargos. Motor proteins are nanoscale machines made from two polypeptide chains folded and wound together (Fig. 1 A). These protein dimers have enzymatic feet (called “motor heads”) that bind to the microtubule filament and use ATP to cause alternative stepping in a hand-over-hand style (Fig. 1 A) (4, 5). Numerous biophysical studies have discovered a number of amazing properties about motor proteins, including their step size, their maximum force, their velocity, and the “run length” for how far single motors can run (4, 6 – 9) ...|$|R
