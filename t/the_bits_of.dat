But the place proved too strong and too well defended. Because of the numerous stockades outside the city, the Burmese could not even get near the wall, and those that got near were cut down by musket fire from atop. The Burmese now drew a line of entrenchments round the city, and prepared to reduce it by famine. As time passed and no signs of surrender appeared, {{the approach of the}} dreaded rainy season caused alarm among the Burmese command. Several senior commanders advised calling off the invasion. However, Maha Nawrahta decided to continue the invasion, and his colleague Thihapate supported him.

500|$|In 1870, Treasury Secretary George Boutwell sent Congress a draft bill {{to replace}} the {{outdated}} 1837 Mint Act and <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> legislation passed over the years regarding the mint and coinage. [...] Even in the draft bill, no provision was made for the three-cent silver, though some in Congress wished to retain the coin {{in anticipation of the}} resumption of specie payments. [...] After much debate in Congress, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Coinage Act of 1873 on February 12 of that year. [...] The law abolished the two-cent piece, three-cent silver, half dime, and standard silver dollar (later restored in 1878). Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces [...] "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage". Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might have directly competed with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to industrialist Joseph Wharton, whose mines produced much of the nickel ore used in coinage. According to numismatist R.W. Julian, the three-cent silver [...] "had played its part well in the U.S. monetary system, but there was no longer any need for it".|$|E
