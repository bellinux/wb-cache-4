30|$|For the {{empirical}} analysis, we construct four dummy variables {{according to the}} distance between the pay day <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reference <b>week.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> first dummy variable is equal to one if the pay date takes place, at least, two <b>weeks</b> before <b>the</b> reference <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> zero otherwise. Similarly, the second dummy takes the value of one when the pay date occurs one <b>week</b> before <b>the</b> reference <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> zero otherwise. <b>The</b> third dummy variable is equal to one if the pay date happens some day during <b>the</b> reference <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> zero otherwise. Finally, the fourth dummy variable takes the value of one when the pay date takes place after <b>the</b> reference <b>week,</b> <b>and</b> zero if not 8.|$|R

This calculated value determines which day of <b>the</b> <b>week</b> {{it is in the}} 1-, 2-, <b>and</b> 10-day <b>weeks.</b> If <b>the</b> calculated value is even, then the day is Pept in <b>the</b> two-day <b>week</b> <b>and</b> Luang in <b>the</b> one-day <b>week.</b> But, if <b>the</b> calculated value is odd then the day is Menga in <b>the</b> two-day <b>week</b> <b>and</b> is not a day of <b>the</b> one-day <b>week.</b> <b>The</b> day in <b>the</b> ten-day <b>week</b> is <b>the</b> one for which the calculated value matches its urip.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} international {{evidence for}} the presence of the day of <b>the</b> <b>week</b> effects in stock market returns denominated in both local currencies and the US dollars in most of the nineteen countries in the sample for the period July 1993 to July 1998. The observed daily patterns differ for local and dollar returns, the latter being exhibiting lower daily means and higher standard deviations. In local currency terms, a pattern of higher returns around the middle of <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Tuesday <b>and</b> then Wednesday; and a lower pattern towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> then Friday, are observed. In dollar terms, a higher pattern occurs around the middle of <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Wednesday <b>and</b> then Tuesday; and a lower one is observed towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> then Friday. The lower patterns are more apparent in both cases. Volatility is the highest on Mondays in both local and dollar returns. Local returns have the lowest volatility towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> Thursday <b>and</b> Friday, whereas the lowest volatility of dollar returns are observed on Tuesdays. The results have useful implications for international portfolio diversification. Day of <b>the</b> <b>Week</b> Effects, Volatility, International Stock Markets...|$|R
