2500|$|... "Emily" [...] {{was written}} between Duce and a {{collective}} known as The Invisible Men. The song was written {{as a joke}} about Duce's dog Rosie. After realising he was stretching a two-syllable word over a three-syllable melody, Duce substituted Rosie for Emily. The middle eight section in [...] "Stays the Same" [...] consists of several percussion instruments recorded in a live room. The instruments were [...] "smashed out [...] syncopated rhythms". [...] "Live Slow, Die Old" [...] is despite how [...] "rich, powerful, strong or intelligent" [...] a person may be, they will die, according to Duce. [...] "Damn Nation" [...] is Duce venting about how he disagrees with organised religion. Duce had previously been subjected to religion being [...] "forced down my throat" [...] from when he was young. Duce loved the lyric [...] "time time ticking by, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> spend we cannot buy", which resulted in him writing [...] "Time". [...] "Just What You Need" [...] refers to sex. [...] "Number One" [...] is about Duce [...] "wanting to leave my mark on this earth" [...] and him being in the band [...] "is hopefully me leaving a piece of me behind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that [...] "Film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, {{even if it}} can also be clunky and sentimental at times." [...] James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as [...] "Brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science." [...] Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is [...] "a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike." [...] New York Post critic Lou Lumenick deemed Interstellar as [...] "a soulful, must-see masterpiece, one of the most exhilarating film experiences so far this century." [...] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is one of the most}} beautiful films I have ever seen— in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> all know but can't measure in scientific terms.

2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said {{would not be a}} great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E
2500|$|The Parthenon's façade {{as well as}} {{elements}} of its façade and elsewhere are said {{by some to be}} circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, [...] "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the Elements (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, {{as well as in the}} dodecahedron (a regular polyhedron whose twelve faces are regular pentagons). It is indeed exemplary that the great Euclid, contrary to generations of mystics who followed, would soberly treat that number for what it is, without attaching to it other than its factual properties." [...] And Keith Devlin says, [...] "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook Elements, written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value." [...] Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the album's creation, Sugababes {{signed a}} US record deal with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation. The album was {{recorded}} by Sugababes mostly in Los Angeles and New York {{but as a}} producer liked them so much they {{did a couple of}} sessions in London. The group primarily worked with RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Fernando Garibay, up-and-coming production team the Smeezingtons (Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars). One of the album's tracks, [...] "No More You", was written by Ne-Yo. Keisha Buchanan compared the song to Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like our fourth member, listening to all our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I think <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do was come back with something different." [...] She also admitted the girls had become [...] "complacent" [...] around the time of Catfights and Spotlights but they also said that they are very proud of that album.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s I was {{fortunate}} enough to have visited Russia. If anyone has ever seen Siberia, it is incredibly beautiful but incredibly harsh and unforgiving as well. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that everyone who lives there has in common that runs across it in relative safety is the Trans-Siberian Railway. Life, too, can be incredibly beautiful but also incredibly harsh and unforgiving, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> all have in common that runs across it in relative safety is music.

50|$|The {{music of}} the ballet is {{considered}} to be written with the participation of Louis XIII. While some claim he had written only a few airs (Catherine Cressac in L'Orchestre de Louis XIII), most experts consider the entire ballet to be written by Louis XIII (A. Lloyd Moote in Louis XIII, <b>the</b> Just). <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> know for sure is that Louis XIII made up the story, the choreography and danced himself in the ballet. The music is very typical for the era of Louis XIII, yet it is very interesting for modern musicologists, since it is crucial for the understanding of development from Late Renaissance to Early and High Baroque music.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> have to avoid, then, {{even while}} we carry {{on our own}} old process of education, is this {{development}} of the powers of so-called self-expression in a child.

All that we do is to pervert the child into a ghastly state of self-consciousness, making him affectedly try to show off as we wish him to show off.

2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there.

For this record {{we wanted to go}} out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, and I think he was key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|R

5000|$|During a panel {{discussion}} on Red Hat Summit in Boston in June 2008 Microsoft's national technology officer Stuart McKee said that [...] "ODF has clearly won". He made also a following statement:We found ourselves so far down {{the path of the}} standardisation process with no knowledge. We don't have a standards office. We didn't have a standards department in the company. I think <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> would acknowledge and that we were frustrated with is that, by the time we realised {{what was going on and}} the competitive environment that was underway, we were late and there was a lot of catch-up. It was very difficult to enter into conversations around the world where the debate had already been framed.|$|R
60|$|Such {{questions}} are bewildering, {{and it is}} difficult to know that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table, which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a problem full of surprising possibilities. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> know about it is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we have the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a community of souls: Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God; sober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection of electric charges in violent motion.|$|E
60|$|Men were weak, I say, {{and because}} of their {{weakness}} we were compelled to make the only other reward that was within our power. It was the reward of death. Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors. For every man who betrayed us, from one to a dozen faithful avengers were loosed upon his heels. We might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies, such as the Pococks, for instance; but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{could not afford to}} fail in was the punishment of our own traitors. Comrades turned traitor by permission, in order to win to the wonder cities and there execute our sentences on the real traitors. In fact, so terrible did we make ourselves, that it became a greater peril to betray us than to remain loyal to us.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{had begun}} to think that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> wanted in this little home of ours was company, {{and that it was}} a great pity to have that nice bedroom on the second floor entirely wasted, with nobody ever in it. So, as far as I was concerned, I would be very glad to have some {{pleasant}} person in the house, at least for a day or two, and I didn't believe Jone would object. At any rate it would put a stop, at least for a little while, to his eternally saying how Corinne, our daughter, would enjoy that room, and how nice it would be if we was to take this house {{for the rest of the}} season and send for her. Now, Corinne's as happy as she can be at her grand-mother's farm, and her school will begin before we're ready to come home, and, what is more, we didn't come here to spend all our time in one place.|$|E
60|$|Another {{objection}} to the phrase about the almighty dollar {{is that it is}} an almighty phrase, and therefore an almighty nuisance. I mean that it is made to explain everything, and to explain everything much too well; that is, much too easily. It does not really help people to understand a foreign country; but it gives them the fatal illusion that they do understand it. Dollars stood for America as frogs stood for France; because it was necessary to connect particular foreigners with something, or it would be so easy to confuse a Moor with a Montenegrin or a Russian with a Red Indian. The only cure for this sort of satisfied familiarity is the shock of something really unfamiliar. When people can see nothing at all in American democracy except a Yankee running after a dollar, then the only {{thing to do is to}} trip them up as they run after the Yankee, or run away with their notion of the Yankee, by the obstacle of certain odd and obstinate facts that have no relation to that notion. And, as a matter of fact, there are a number of such obstacles to any such generalisation; a number of notable facts that have to be reconciled somehow to our previous notions. It does not matter for this purpose whether the facts are favourable or unfavourable, or whether the qualities are merits or defects; especially as we do not even understand them sufficiently to say which they are. The point is that we are brought to a pause, and compelled to attempt to understand them rather better than we do. <b>We</b> have found <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> did not expect; and therefore <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> cannot explain. And we are moved to an effort, probably an unsuccessful effort, to explain it.|$|R
