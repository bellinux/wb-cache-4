50|$|In 1943 {{the federal}} Treasury Section of Fine Arts {{commissioned}} artist Austin Mecklem and his wife, Marianne Greer Appel, {{to paint a}} mural, Old Town in Alaska, intended for the Wrangell post office. The work was completed at their studio in New York state, <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> <b>railway</b> on Oct 19, 1943, arrived in Wrangell in December 1943 and installed in early 1944.|$|R

25|$|The {{gold was}} heavily escorted and was <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> <b>railway,</b> {{according}} to witnesses of the events. A {{few days after}} the extraction of the gold from the Bank of Spain, Bank functionaries retrieved the Bank's silver, valued at a total of 656,708,702.59 Spanish pesetas of the time, which was later sold to the United States and France between June 1938 and July 1939 for a sum slightly more than 20 million U.S. dollars of the time (a portion of the silver was confiscated by French authorities).|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the street}} {{does not have}} tram lines or train {{stations}} located on it, it is easily reached by public <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> Parliament <b>railway</b> station, Flinders Street railway station and Melbourne Central railway station. It also intersects with several streets which are serviced by Melbourne tramlines, including Victoria Street, La Trobe Street, Bourke Street, Collins Street and Flinders Street.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{alternatives}} {{modes of}} transport {{had to be}} found. One idea {{came in the form}} of a British tidal expert resident in Siam, Herbert Warington Smyth, who suggested, perhaps half-cynically, that a tramway or a canal with a series of locks should be built around the falls. The latter, he reckoned, ‘would satisfactorily cripple the French economy, costing about the same as the Manchester Ship Canal yet never carrying more than one ten-thousandth of its tonnage’. The French duly settled with a small portage railway across the island of Don Khon and later Don Det island. This would allow specially designed vessels that could be dismantled, <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> the <b>railway</b> and then reassembled and launched further upstream.|$|R
50|$|The Nagoya Rinkai Railway ("Nagoya Seaside Railway") is a Japanese freight-only railway {{company in}} Nagoya, Aichi, shared by Japan Freight Railway Company, Nagoya Port Authority, and Nippon Express. The third sector company (in {{a sense in}} Japan) was founded in 1965. The company is {{abbreviated}} as Meirin (名臨). Its lines serve the industrial area of the Nagoya Port. They mainly <b>transport</b> limestones <b>via</b> Seinō <b>Railway,</b> chemical products, train cars of Nagoya Railroad, or car parts of Toyota Motor.|$|R
30|$|Environmental impacts {{associated}} with transportation could be minimized {{by changing the}} source of energy and mode of transportation of the timber products. Use of {{renewable sources of energy}} such as electricity generated from hydropower, and biofuel, instead of fossil based energy would reduce emission during the transportation. Interestingly, in Sweden it was reported that <b>transporting</b> forest products <b>via</b> <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> requires less process energy than by using road vehicles. Furthermore, use of biofuel instead of fossil fuel in a lorry could replace about 96 % of fossil energy (Lindholm and Berg 2005).|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{livestock}} that supplied the works was <b>transported</b> in <b>via</b> the <b>railway</b> from farms to the south. For around three decades, {{an average of}} 30,000 head of livestock per annum were transported to the works, though this could fluctuate significantly {{from one year to}} the next. The livestock trade on the Nelson Section, however, paled in comparison to that on the neighbouring Picton Section (now part of the Main North Line) which was consistently transporting 150,000 head per annum.|$|R
40|$|In {{the scope}} of four related essays this thesis {{analyses}} the Chinese domestic coal sector and coal trade policies and their respective impact on international steam coal trade economics. In particular, the thesis investigates the role of domestic transport infrastructure investment policies as well as Chinese coal export and import controls and the potential exertion of market power through such trade instruments. For this purpose, several spatial equilibrium models have been developed that enable simulation runs to compare different policy scenarios. These models also permit ex-post analyses to empirically test hypotheses of non-competitive market conduct of individual players under the assumption of Cournot behaviour. These model-based analyses yield, among others, the following findings: If coal is converted into electricity early in the Chinese energy supply chain, worldwide marginal costs of supply are substantially lower than if coal is <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> <b>railway.</b> This can reduce China's dependence on international imports significantly. Allocation of welfare changes, particularly in favour of Chinese consumers while rents of international producers decrease. If not only seaborne trade but also interactions and feedbacks between domestic coal markets and international trade markets are accounted for, trade volumes and prices of a China - Indonesia duopoly fit the real market outcome best in 2008. Real Chinese export quotas have been consistent with simulated exports under a Cournot-Nash strategy. Uncertainties with regard to future Chinese coal demand and coal sector policies generate significant costs for international investors and lead to a spatial and temporal reallocation of mining and infrastructure investments. The potential exertion of Chinese demand side market power would further reduce the overall investment activity of exporters. ...|$|R
50|$|Near Kristineberg is Kristinebergsgruvan, {{a former}} open pit copper mine {{exploited}} by the predecessor {{of the present}} Boliden AB. The ore was <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> a 96 km long ropeway conveyor to Boliden and from there <b>via</b> <b>railway</b> to the port of Skellefteå. The ropeway has been closed in 1987 except for 13 km used by the Norsjö aerial tramway as a tourist attraction.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} make the railway more financially profitable, railway rates were {{increased}} in 1919 and subsequent years, which did not yield greater profits and raised food prices and those of goods <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> the <b>railway.</b> Thus, the working class conditions, which included the majority of the railway workers, did not improve. In another attempt at improving the financial efficiency of the railway in Sierra Leone, Colonel Hammond, a railway expert, was invited to inspect the Sierra Leone Railway in 1922 and 1924. Following Hammond’s second visit, Governor Alexander Ransford Slater, approved a proposal by the general manager, G.R. Webb, imposing an efficiency bar examination for African clerks trying to qualify for salary increases. The attempt to introduce the examination was met by protest {{on the side of the}} clerks, who criticized the European staff being exempt from the examination and the failure to give Africans generally permanent appointments. This attempt at introducing a discriminatory policy by the government helped to unify middle class, white-collar Creole clerks, who might otherwise not have been such strong voices in the union, and more manual daily-wage laborers in their discontent and subsequent activism in the railway union. Artisans and clerks, part of the Railway Skilled Artisan Union, had regularly sent petitions to the railway administration. In March 1925, for example, they petitioned the general manager to introduce a grading system, in order to create more jobs and generate greater efficiency. The petitioners were met with contempt and discouragement by the administration, which promptly dismissed key workers for their “inefficiency." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} investigates and compares the public {{perception}} of CO 2 offshore storage, CO 2 onshore storage and CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> pipeline in Germany nationwide and in two coastal regions. For this purpose, three representative surveys were carried out and analyzed with the methods of descriptive statistics and ordinal regressions. The results of our descriptive statistical analyses show clear regional differences with regard to self-reported awareness, factual knowledge, risk perceptions and general attitudes towards CO 2 offshore/onshore storage and CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> pipeline. With regard to {{the public perception}} of the two storage options – offshore and onshore – no major differences could be identified: both are hardly accepted by the German public. In comparison to CO 2 offshore storage/CO 2 onshore storage, the attitudes towards CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> pipeline were perceptibly more positive in all regions. Our regression analyses revealed that {{the perceptions of the}} personal and societal risks of CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> pipeline/CO 2 offshore storage/CO 2 onshore storage as well as the perceptions of the personal and societal benefits of CCS are the most important direct determinants of general attitudes towards CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> pipeline, CO 2 offshore storage and CO 2 onshore storage...|$|R
