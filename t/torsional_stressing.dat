40|$|In {{the present}} paper a new method is {{presented}} {{for the evaluation of}} <b>torsional</b> <b>stressing</b> of diesel-generator sets consisting of components with uncertain torsional characteristics. A frequency scanning technique is implemented for eigenvalue analysis of the elastic system. Due to the uncertainty of the values of stiffness and damping coefficients, a sensitivity analysis method is also presented, suitable for the evaluation of the range of the mechanical stresses. Special consideration is given to the correct simulation of the coupling to the electric network, including the influence of generator regulators and possible network interactions. An exact formula is extracted for the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for slim constructions and {{improvement}} of erection methods on building site composite slim-floor systems become more important. In the present european and national codes do not include complete design rules for slim-floor constructions. Therefore {{the objective of this}} thesis is concentrated on the development of design rules for slim-floor girders. During the erection stage the elastic design resistance of the steel girder is decisive. Because of the slight plate thickness and sometimes considerable <b>torsional</b> <b>stressing</b> the influence of the shape deformation becomes more important and has to be considered. In this approach the steel sections are filled with concrete in the final state. Thereby the concrete in the openings, arranged in the web or upper flange, work concurrently as concrete dowels. The determination of moment resistance follows the rules for composite structures, respectively whereas in many cases the strain limited design is relevant and additionally the influences from transverse bending in the bottom flange have to be considered. Because of the sheathing of the concrete encasement by the steel section a hybrid truss model with a compression strut in the concrete section is developed, increasing the shear of the section. In case of fire, the directly flamed bottom flange can be substituted by longitudinal reinforcement bars and a high fire resistance period can be realized without any additional activities. For the analysis in case of fire, a design-method is extracted according to EN 1994 - 1 - 2. Based on a transient analysis, thermal analytic functions are developed to describe the temperature distribution in the cross section. The crack behaviour of the concrete slab has already {{a significant impact on the}} girder deformation in the serviceability limit state. The concrete flange adopts a remarkable part of the bending-moment. Compared to general treatment of common composite girders, the neglecting of these bending influences can lead to unrealistic camber of the girder. Therefore, an approximation procedure is derived that considers the bearing of the resilience of composite connector and the crack behaviour on the structure deformation...|$|E
40|$|The nickel-based Alloy 600, {{also known}} as Inconel 600 {{has been found to}} be {{susceptible}} to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in high temperature aqueous environments. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which this process occurs remain in question. It is known that SCC results from the simultaneous effects of a chemically corrosive environment and a tensile stress. Many studies have been conducted on the microscopic chemical changes associated with SCC. There have been fewer studies of the microscopic stress/strain process. The main objective of this thesis is to use the new x-ray based diffraction technique – polychromatic x-ray microdiffraction (PXM) to study changes of the microstructure and elastic/plastic deformation introduced by SCC in Alloy 600, thus leading us to an understanding of the mechanisms of SCC. More traditional techniques such as neutron diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were also used in this thesis. Neutron diffraction measures information down to a depth resolution of a few mm, while EBSD is considered to be a surface measurement (1 - 2 μm). By comparison, PXM examines strain to a depth of several grains in alloy 600 (~ 60 μm), which is particularly appropriate for detecting information from intergranular interactions under typical stress corrosion conditions. The capability of measuring strain directions (compressive or tensile) is another advantage of PXM in SCC study. Besides the microstructure and elastic strain information, the local plastic deformation can also be examined by assessing the streaking/splitting of the Laue spots and modeling of the Laue diffraction images. In this thesis, PXM was first validated by comparing the data to those from neutron diffraction and EBSD for a simple case – uniaxially stressed tensile specimens. Then studies were carried out on C-ring samples before and after cracked by SCC. <b>Torsional</b> <b>stressing</b> of an Alloy 600 C-ring specimen results in significant tensile strain in the stress axis direction. Intergranular SCC (IGSCC) was observed in Alloy 600 C-ring specimens electrochemically corroded in a high temperature caustic solution. Tensile strains with respect to the stress axis and plastic strain could be identified in regions ahead of the crack tip. These regions iv correspond to triple junctions where crack arrest occurs and re-initiation requires a buildup of the strains.

Files of size 25 /. 06 and 30 /. 06 from the three file types were compared (n= 20 /group). <b>Torsional</b> <b>stress</b> resistance was evaluated by measuring the torque in gram-centimeters (g-cm) and angle of rotation (degrees) required for instrument separation with use of a torsiometer instrument. The fractured files were examined using SEM to look at deformation and fracture surface characteristics. The data was analyzed with ANOVA to determine statistical differences. The three file types showed a statistically significant difference in both maximum <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> and angle of rotation prior to failure.

40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveThe {{greatest}} forces {{experienced by}} bones result from muscular contractions—muscles produce most force in high-velocity eccentric contractions. Bouncing movements, e. g., sprinting or hopping—where such contractions occur—are {{highly beneficial for}} lower limb bones. However, {{there is a growing}} body of evidence that <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> are highly osteogenic. Sports in which frequent quick turning occurs—hence large <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> can be expected—e. g., tennis, may also improve bone strength {{even in the absence of}} large ground reaction and muscle forces. MethodsTo investigate the relative effects of bouncing and turning movements on bones, we recruited 47 older men (mean age 62. 4  ±  12. 9 years). They were competitive sprinters (representing exposure to bouncing movement), competitive tennis players (turning movements), and inactive controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of tibial diaphysis at 66 % distal–proximal length were taken; muscle sizes from peripheral quantitative computed tomography and countermovement jump performance were also examined. ResultsBone strength of tennis players was clearly greater than that of controls (23 % greater bone mass; p    0. 5). Material eccentricity analysis suggests that <b>torsional</b> <b>stresses</b> may be a significant adaptive stimulus to tibial bone. ConclusionResults suggest that sports with quick turning movements are highly osteogenic, even in the absence of greater muscular output.

40|$|AbstractNegatively twisted DNA is {{essential}} to many biological functions. Due to <b>torsional</b> <b>stress,</b> duplex DNA can have local, sequence-dependent structural defects. In this work, a thermodynamic model of DNA was built to qualitatively predict the local sequence-dependent mechanical instabilities under <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> The results were compared to both simulation of a coarse-grained model and experiment results. By using the Kirkwood superposition approximation, we built an analytical model to represent the free energy difference ΔW of a hydrogen-bonded basepair between the B-form helical state and the basepair opened (or locally melted) state, within a given sequence under <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> We showed that ΔW can be well approximated by two-body interactions with its nearest-sequence-neighbor basepairs plus a free energy correction due to long-range correlations. This model is capable of rapidly predicting the position and thermodynamics of local defects in a given sequence. The result qualitatively matches with an in vitro experiment for a long DNA sequence (> 4000 basepairs). The 12 parameters used in this model can be further quantitatively refined when more experimental data are available...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>torsional</b> <b>stress</b> in eukaryotic chromatin has been controversial. To {{determine whether it}} could be detected, we probed the structure of an alternating AT tract.

The single-strand-specific nuclease P 1 {{was used to determine}} the structure of an alternating AT sequence upstream of the Xenopus beta-globin gene when assembled into chromatin in microinjected Xenopus oocytes. The pattern of cleavage by P 1 nuclease strongly suggests that the DNA in this chromatin template is under <b>torsional</b> <b>stress.</b> The cruciform was detected specifically in the most fully reconstituted templates at later stages of chromatin assembly, suggesting that negative supercoiling is associated with chromatin maturation. Furthermore, the number of torsionally strained templates increased dramatically at the time when transcription of assembled chromatin templates began. Transcription itself has been shown to induce supercoiling, but the requisite negative supercoiling for cruciform extrusion by (AT) n in oocytes was not generated in this way since the characteristic P 1 cutting pattern was retained even when RNA polymerase elongation was blocked with alpha-amanitin.
