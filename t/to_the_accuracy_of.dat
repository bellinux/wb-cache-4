5|$|Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues (based on Giuseppe Chiara, {{who later}} in the film {{goes by the name}} Okada San'emon). In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his {{extensive}} year-long preparation for the role with James Martin, a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York. Garfield detailed that the preparation with Martin included extensive research and immersion in the Jesuit lifestyle and frame of mind which was felt to be essential <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the film by the producers. Garfield, who is of slight to medium frame, reported losing 40 pounds to play the role following the rules of abstention which were outlined to him by Martin.|$|E

25|$|Mason's {{locomotives}} were genuinely handsome without ornaments. His {{influence was}} exerted over all locomotive builders {{at the time}} and later. In 1856 he built two locomotives for the Cairo and Alexandria Railroad of Egypt in which a commentator said that the engines' excellence was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> execution attained by an admirable set of tools and a skillful set of workmen. Opinion by master mechanics was that they were the easiest engines to keep in repair. In 1871, the Mason Bogie was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the end effector, for example a gripper, and even {{to the design of}} the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|When using a {{comparator}} as a null detector, {{there are}} limits as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the zero value measurable. Zero output is given when {{the magnitude of the}} difference in the voltages multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is less than the voltage limits. For example, if the gain of the amplifier is 106, and the voltage limits are ±6V, then no output will be given if the difference in the voltages is less than 6μV. One could refer to this as a sort of uncertainty in the measurement.|$|E

25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|If {{observation}} {{is confined to}} regions sufficiently remote from a system of charges, a multipole expansion of the exact polarization density can be made. By truncating this expansion (for example, retaining only the dipole terms, or only the dipole and quadrupole terms, or etc.), {{the results of the}} previous section are regained. In particular, truncating the expansion at the dipole term, the result is indistinguishable from the polarization density generated by a uniform dipole moment confined to the charge region. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> this dipole approximation, as shown in the previous section, the dipole moment density p(r) (which includes not only p but the location of p) serves as P(r).|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} resurfacing, {{there was some}} dispute as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the measurement.

In an interview with Stock Car Racings Larry Cothren, driver Ryan Newman openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, {{and found that the}} turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A Camping World Truck Series open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22–27degrees, in a variable banking configuration.|$|E

The fitting was not without incident though, as the extra weight caused some compaction of the track bed, and assistance was required to move the locomotive back into the works, by a combination of being winched, towed by a forklift truck and pushed with Land Rovers.|$|E
25|$|India {{needed to}} cross 400 {{runs in the}} second innings just to make Australia bat again, which they had not scored even once in the entire series.

25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} the kernel {{function}} K is not crucial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> kernel density estimators, so we use the standard multivariate normal kernel throughout: , where H {{plays the role of}} the covariance matrix. On the other hand, the {{choice of the}} bandwidth matrix H {{is the single most important}} factor affecting its accuracy since it controls the amount and orientation of smoothing induced. That the bandwidth matrix also induces an orientation is a basic difference between multivariate kernel density estimation from its univariate analogue since orientation is not defined for 1D kernels. This leads to the choice of the parametrisation of this bandwidth matrix. The three main parametrisation classes (in increasing order of complexity) are S, the class of positive scalars times the identity matrix; D, diagonal matrices with positive entries on the main diagonal; and F, symmetric positive definite matrices. The S class kernels have the same amount of smoothing applied in all coordinate directions, D kernels allow different amounts of smoothing in each of the coordinates, and F kernels allow arbitrary amounts and orientation of the smoothing. Historically S and D kernels are the most widespread due to computational reasons, but research indicates that important gains in accuracy can be obtained using the more general F class kernels.|$|E
