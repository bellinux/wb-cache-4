40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} the {{literature}} is whether attention can form two or more independent spatial foci {{in addition to the}} well-known unique spatial focus. There is evidence that voluntary visual attention divides in space. The possibility that this also occurs for automatic visual attention was investigated here. Thirty-six female volunteers were tested. In each trial, a prime stimulus was presented in the left or right visual hemifield. This stimulus was characterized by <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> a superior, middle or inferior ring, <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> all these rings, or <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior and inferior rings. A target stimulus to which the volunteer should respond with the same side hand or a target stimulus to which she should not respond was presented 100 ms later in a primed location, a location between two primed locations or a location in the contralateral hemifield. Reaction time to the positive target stimulus in a primed location was consistently shorter than reaction time in the horizontally corresponding contralateral location. This attentional effect was significantly smaller or absent when the positive target stimulus appeared in the middle location after the double prime stimulus. These results suggest that automatic visual attention can focus on two separate locations simultaneously, to some extent sparing the region in between. CNPqFINE...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{observation}} of an intermediate state in <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> single CdSe/CdS core-shell nanocrystals. This state has a low quantum yield and connects the "on" and "off" states commonly observed in <b>the</b> photoluminescence <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> Individual nanocrystals. We find that the transitions between these two emitting states follow nearly single-exponential statistics. The transitions from the "on" state to this intermediate state result from changes in the surface passivation of the nanocrystal. The data are consistent with photoinduced, adsorption/desorption events that {{take place at the}} surface of the nanocrystals. The trion state leads to a reduction in photoluminescence in nanocrystals...|$|R

40|$|ON-OFF intermittency or {{blinking}} is {{a phenomenon}} observed in single quantum emitters, which reduces their overall light emission. Even though {{it seems to be}} a fundamental property of quantum dots (QDs), substantial differences can be found in <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> statistics <b>of</b> different nanocrystals. This work compares <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> numerous single, oxide-capped Si nanocrystals with that of CdSe/ZnS core-shell nanocrystals, measured under the same conditions in the same experimental system and over a broad range of excitation power densities. We find that ON- and OFF-times can be described by exponential statistics in Si QDs, as opposed to power-law statistics for the CdSe nanocrystals. <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> <b>blinking</b> (power-law or monoexponential) does not depend on excitation but seems to be an intrinsic property of the material system. Upon increasing excitation power, the duty cycle of Si quantum dots remains constant, whereas it decreases for CdSe nanocrystals, which is readily explained by blinking statistics. Both ON-OFF and OFF-ON transitions can be regarded as light-induced in Si/SiO 2 QDs, while the OFF-ON transition in CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals is not stimulated by photons. <b>The</b> differences in <b>blinking</b> behavior in these systems will be discussed.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>blinking</b> {{behavior}} <b>of</b> perylene diïmide molecules is investigated at the single-molecule level. We observe long-time scale <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> individual multi-chromophoric complexes {{embedded in}} a poly(methylmethacrylate) matrix, {{as well as for}} the monomeric dye absorbed on a glass substrate at ambient conditions. In both these different systems, <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> <b>of</b> single molecules is found to obey analogous power-law statistics for both the on and off periods. The observed range for single-molecular power-law <b>blinking</b> extends over <b>the</b> full experimental time window, covering four orders of magnitude in time and six orders of magnitude in probability density. From molecule to molecule, we observe a large spread in off-time power-law exponents. The distributions of off-exponents in both systems are markedly different whereas both on-exponent distributions appear similar. Our results are consistent with models that ascribe the power-law behavior to charge separation and (environment-dependent) recombination by electron tunneling to a dynamic distribution of charge acceptors. As a consequence of power-law statistics, single molecule properties like the total number of emitted photons display non-ergodicity...|$|R
