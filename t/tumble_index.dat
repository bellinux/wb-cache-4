40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of grain size {{distribution}} control of the raw material mixture on the permeability of the green sinter bed and the properties of the produced sinter. This was achieved by evaluating the granulation characteristics of the sinter mixture (moisture content, granulation time and mean granule diameter) in terms of its green bed permeability, and evaluating the productivity of the sinter bed, the coke rate, <b>tumble</b> <b>index</b> (TI), abrasion index (AI), reduction disintegration index (RDI) and reducibility (RI) of the produced sinter. The raw sinter mixtures contained combinations of Thabazimbi iron ore, Sishen iron ore, coke, lime and return fines. The grain size distributions were controlled by removing the – 0. 5 mm size fractions of the return fines and coke, and the – 1 mm size fraction of lime. Of the examined mixtures, a mixture of 20 mass% Thabazimbi iron ore, 80 mass% Sishen iron ore and fluxes where the coke, lime and return fines were all sized had the highest granulation effectiveness and permeability. The sintering properties of the mixtures in which the grain size distributions were controlled, were very similar for all the mixtures, but superior to the base case mixture in which the grain size distribution was not controlled...|$|E
40|$|The sinter {{quality is}} {{dependent}} on sinter mineralogy, which in turn depends on the chemical compositions of the sinter mix. Although many research works have been conducted, further investigation {{on the effect of}} chemical compositions (MgO, A 2 O 3, Basicity) on the sinter quality is still required for further improvement of the sinter and more alternative additives are still being tested. In this project, a sinter pot has been used to manufacture sinters, which were characterized using point-counting to quantify the different phases and X-Ray diffraction to identify the polymorphic forms of Ca 2 SiO 4 of the silicate phases. The produced sinters were evaluated with respect to reducibility index (RI), reduction degradation index (RDI), physical breakdown (TI and AI), and production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The influence of ignition temperature, magnesium oxide, alumina addition and basicity on the mineralogy as well as physical and chemical properties of iron ore sinters were investigated. Results were obtained as follows: For the Base case with a basicity of 2, 2. 8 mass% MgO content, 1. 7 mass % Al 2 O 3 and 10 mass% CaO, the effect of ignition temperature, which ranged between 864 oC and 1100 oC, on the sinter quality was investigated. Results showed that the ignition temperature had an effect on the sinter properties: reducibility (RI), physical strength (TI and AI), production properties (yield, coke breeze rate and production rate). The temperature 1053 oC was the best ignition temperature for an economically acceptable sinter. A further increase in ignition temperature was found to form melt {{on the surface of the}} sinter produced, leading to a sinter of low quality. Also, X-rays diffraction pattern showed that the allotropic transformation of the Ca 2 SiO 4 did not take place. The Low SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter had the highest reducibility index and had the highest Abrasion index and the lowest coke breeze rate at 2. 8 mass% MgO content compared to all the sinters produced in this project. For the High SiO 2 – Low Al 2 O 3 sinter MgO was added through dolomite and fused magnesia. A comparative study on the effect of dolomite and fused magnesia was conducted. The sinter to which fused magnesia was added had lower reducibility, higher reduction degradation, higher <b>tumble</b> <b>index,</b> lower abrasion index and lower coke breeze rate than the sinter to which dolomite was added. High SiO 2 – High Al 2 O 3 sinter had the lowest reducibility index, the lowest reduction degradation, the lowest tumbler index and the highest coke breeze rate. The increase in MgO content in all the sinters produced increased the coke breeze rate. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

5000|$|The {{delivery}} of a curveball is entirely {{different from that of}} most other pitches. The pitcher {{at the top of the}} throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and <b>tumbles</b> over the <b>index</b> finger thus imparting the forward or [...] "top-spin" [...] characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the four-seam fastball's backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the axis of rotation perpendicular to the intended flight path much like a reel-type mower or a bowling ball.|$|R

Shares of Shin Corp., linked to Thaksin, and its units declined. The SET Index dropped 9.99, or 1.4 percent, to 692.57 at the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok. The SET Index fell 29.64 points, or 4.2% to 702.63 {{in the first}} minutes of trading Thursday to its lowest intraday level since July 21.

40|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{is still the}} {{dominant}} form of iron production, but over the years, direct reduction methods have increased due {{to a number of}} reasons. Overall, iron production methods have optimal requirements with respect to the feed materials especially iron ore. In this study, tests were carried out on Muko iron ore from Uganda to analyse its suitability to meet the feed requirements of today's dominant iron production methods. More specifically, the Tumbler, Abrasion, and Shatter Indices of the ore were determined. In addition, porosity, thermoanalysis, and reducibility tests were performed. Overall, the Muko ore was found to have good mechanical properties exemplified with <b>tumble</b> and shatter <b>index</b> data > 89. 0 [*]wt% and < 2. 5 [*]wt%, respectively. Furthermore, its reducibility at 0. 87 %/min is within the acceptable range as a natural material feed for blast furnace and direct reduction furnaces. Also, the energy requirement for heating the ore to 1100 °C was found to be higher in the samples containing a wider size range of irregular grains and the largest contaminations. In summary, it is concluded that the Muko iron ore has good physical and metallurgical properties to serve as a natural material for the blast furnace and direct reduction furnaces.
