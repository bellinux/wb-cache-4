BMD was performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine at femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) by a single technician. Of 132 participants, 73 (55. 3 %) were ≤ 30 years; 27 (20. 5 %) were primiparous; 36 (27. 3 %) were grand multiparous; 35 (26. 5 %) never breast fed.

We examined neuropsychiatric symptoms among formerly Mn-exposed workers 14 years after cessation of exposure. Materials and methods: A study was conducted in 1990 among workers from a ferro- and silico-Mn plant and unexposed working men referents from the same region in South-West Quebec. At follow-up in 2004, 77 former Mn-workers and 81 referents agreed to participate and responded to a neuropsychiatric symptom checklist, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI); scores were transformed into <b>T-scores</b> based on a normative population. Cumulated exposure indices (CEI) were computed for each former Mn-worker. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used. Results: Mean <b>T-scores</b> were significantly higher among former Mn-workers than referents on scales of Depression and Anxiety. Mean <b>T-scores</b> of psychological distress increased with the CEI tertiles, with significant associations for the scales Somatization, Depression, Anxiety and Hostility. Former Mn-workers in the two highest tertiles of CEI showed a higher risk for <b>T-scores</b> >= 63 for Hostility (OR, 7. 5; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 38. 9), Depression (OR, 2. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 8. 4) and Anxiety (OR, 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 8. 4).

Methods: Cross-sectional study comparing 3 groups of patients with SCI: patients with daily standing times of more than 1 hour, patients with daily standing times of less than 1 hour, and nonstanding patients. Seventy-one patients with chronic SCI were recruited. They were assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to their reported daily standing time. The bone density of lumbar and proximal femoral regions was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results: The 3 groups were similar in terms of demographics and clinical variables. No significant difference was found among the mean <b>t-scores</b> of lumbar and proximal femoral regions of the groups. However, the patients in the group that stood more than 1 hour daily had a slight tendency to have higher <b>t-scores</b> than those in the control group.

MethodsTwenty post-menopausal women aged 50 – 73 years (mean: 62. 4 ± 6. 5) diagnosed with HOA were recruited along with 10 age-matched post-menopausal women with no signs of HOA as the control group. Both groups had postero-anterior hand radiographs taken and evaluated according to the Kellgren–Lawrence scale to assess OA severity. They underwent thorough clinical examination including measurement of body mass index (BMI). They completed the AUSCAN questionnaire. Grip strength was measured using a hand held dynamometer and lateral pinch strength was measured using a pinchmeter. They underwent BMD measurement at the hip and wrist using Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Furthermore, they had serum osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) measured. ResultsThere was {{no statistically significant difference}} in <b>T-scores</b> of the hip (P= 0. 168) and wrist (P= 0. 45) between the patients and the controls. However, six patients (30 %) had osteoporosis. A total of 12 patients had diminished BMD at the hip. There was no significant increase in serum osteocalcin levels in patients compared to controls (P= 0. 382). However, urinary DPD was significantly elevated in the patient group compared to the controls, (P< 0. 0001). There was a positive correlation between <b>T-scores</b> at the hip and BMI (P= 0. 017). There was a negative correlation of <b>T-scores</b> at the hip and wrist with postmenopausal duration and parity. There was no correlation between the <b>T-scores</b> and bone turnover markers. There was a positive correlation between OA severity and both T and Z-scores at the wrist. ConclusionsAlthough there was no significant association between HOA and BMD, HOA is associated with increased bone turnover as demonstrated by the significant elevation in urinary DPD.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the relationships between blood pressure, blood glucose, and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal Turkish women. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 270 consecutive patients who were admitted to an outpatient clinic with vasomotor symptoms and/or at least 1  year of amenorrhea were included. The patients were categorized into three groups according to their blood pressure and metabolic status as follows: normotensive, hypertensive nondiabetics, and hypertensive diabetics. The T- and z-scores of the proximal femur and lumbar vertebrae were measured with the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry method to assess the BMD of the study groups. Results: Lumbar vertebral <b>T-scores</b> (P< 0. 001), lumbar vertebral z-scores (P< 0. 003), and proximal femoral <b>T-scores</b> (P< 0. 001) were demonstrated to be significantly lower in the hypertensive diabetic group compared to the hypertensive nondiabetic and normotensive groups. Systolic blood pressure was significantly inversely correlated with lumbar vertebral <b>T-scores</b> (r=- 0. 382; P= 0. 001), lumbar vertebral z-scores (r=- 0. 290; P= 0. 001), and proximal femoral <b>T-scores</b> (r=- 0. 340; P= 0. 001). Moreover, diastolic blood pressure was significantly inversely correlated with lumbar vertebral <b>T-scores</b> (r=- 0. 318; P= 0. 001), lumbar vertebral z-scores (r=- 0. 340; P= 0. 001), and proximal femoral <b>T-scores</b> (r=- 0. 304; P= 0. 001). Hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2. 541, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 46 – 3. 48, P= 0. 003), diabetes mellitus (OR: 2. 136, 95 % CI: 1. 254 – 3. 678, P= 0. 006), and age (OR: 1. 069, 95 % CI: 1. 007 – 1. 163, P= 0. 022) were found to be significant independent predictors of osteopenia in a multivariate analysis, after adjusting for other risk parameters. Conclusion: The present study is the first to evaluate the relationships between blood pressure, blood glucose, and BMD in postmenopausal Turkish women. Moreover, both hypertension and diabetes were demonstrated as significant independent predictors of osteopenia in postmenopausal Turkish women. Clinicians should be aware of the high risk of developing osteopenia in diabetic hypertensive postmenopausal women.
