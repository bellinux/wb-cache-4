5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically through <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium at a {{speed of}} 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium {{at a speed}} of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|The Solar System {{is located}} within a {{structure}} called the Local Bubble, a low-density region of <b>the</b> galactic <b>interstellar</b> medium. [...] Within this region is <b>the</b> Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud, {{a region of}} slightly higher hydrogen density. The Sun is {{near the edge of}} <b>the</b> Local <b>Interstellar</b> Cloud. It is thought to have entered the region at some point between 44,000 and 150,000 years ago and is expected to remain within it for another 10,000 to 20,000 years.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a two-photon Lyman alpha driven absorption mechanism in H 2 or H 2 is responsible for <b>the</b> difuse <b>interstellar</b> absorption bands. This hypothesis di#ers radically from previous theories on the origin of <b>the</b> di#use <b>interstellar</b> bands. In order to test the validity of 2 hypothesis, a study is undertaken to calculate the exact properties 2 spectrum relevant to the proposed two-photon mechanism. Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, wavelengths and cross sections for the two-photon mechanism were calculated and compared to <b>the</b> di#use <b>interstellar</b> absorption spectrum. <b>The</b> results {{of this study indicate that}} the H 2 spectrum does not match <b>the</b> observed di#use <b>interstellar</b> band spectrum. 1...|$|R

5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

A comparison of ^(22) Ne/^(20) Ne measurements from various sources implies that galactic cosmic rays with energies > 100 MeV/nuc are not simply an accelerated sample of <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> medium...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen gas is the {{dominant}} component of <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> medium. However, due to ionization and interaction with the heliosphere, direct sampling of neutral hydrogen in the inner heliosphere is more difficult than sampling <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> neutral helium, which penetrates deep into the heliosphere. In this paper {{we report on the}} first detailed analysis of the direct sampling of neutral hydrogen from <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> medium. We confirm that the arrival direction of hydrogen is offset from that of the local Helium component. We further report the discovery of a variation of the penetrating Hydrogen over {{the first two years of}} IBEX observations. Observations are consistent with hydrogen experiencing an effective ratio of outward solar radiation pressure to inward gravitational force greater than unity (μ> 1); the temporal change observed in <b>the</b> local <b>interstellar</b> hydrogen flux can be explained with solar variability...|$|R

The Federation fought several wars with the Khanate of Orion during the 23rd century, until the events of <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Interstellar</b> War forced them to ally against the genocidal Rigellian hordes. Since then, the Federation and Khanate have had a mostly friendly relationship, further solidified by the horrific experiences of <b>the</b> 4th <b>Interstellar</b> War in <b>the</b> late 24th century.|$|R
5|$|As Voyager 1 {{headed for}} {{interstellar}} space, its instruments continued {{to study the}} Solar System.

5|$|Between {{the stars}} lies <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium, {{a region of}} sparse matter.

5|$|Star Trek is an American media {{franchise}} {{based on}} the science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry.

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium {{out of which}} it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E

5|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{and planetary}} magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium {{and the strength}} of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} is a stellar-wind bubble, {{a region}} of space dominated by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400km/s its solar wind, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium.|$|E

5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in <b>the</b> <b>interstellar</b> medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E
