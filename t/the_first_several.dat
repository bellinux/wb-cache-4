During the war, she was involved in the assaults on Tripoli in North Africa and on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. She was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 191415, but the need for warships granted Emanuele Filiberto a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E

5|$|Campania {{was built}} by the Castellammare shipyard, where her keel was laid on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Basilicata. The ships were small enough that they could be built on the same slipway. They were {{launched}} {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. After Fitting-out work was completed, Campannia was commissioned on 18 May 1917, four months before her sister ship. Designed as a colonial cruiser in the mold of the cruiser , Campania spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> years of her career in Italy's African colonies, including Italian Libya. On 1 July 1921, the ship was reclassified as a gunboat and two of her 152mm guns were removed during reconstruction work that lasted until 1922. Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Greene missed {{four games}} in 1975 {{due to a}} pinched nerve, {{snapping}} a streak of 91 straight games started since he entered the league. In December 1975, {{he and the other}} members of the Steel Curtain appeared on the cover of Time magazine. After leading the Steelers to another Super Bowl win after the 1975 season over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl X, Greene missed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> games of the 1976 season with a back injury. The Steelers started off the season 1–4 and looked like they would not make the playoffs. Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was also injured and was replaced by rookie Mike Kruczek. Greene returned and the Steelers defense carried the team to nine-straight wins and the playoffs. With a defense considered one of the best in NFL history, the 1976 Steelers held opponents to an average of less than 10 points per game (138 points over 14 games). During their nine-game winning streak, the Steelers defense recorded five shutouts, including three straight, and surrendered a total of 28 points (roughly 3 points per game). The defense allowed only two touchdowns over nine games. The Steelers were defeated by the Raiders in that year's AFC championship game.|$|E
5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E

On 5 May 1970 Sabo's platoon was attached to the U.S. 4th Infantry Division for a secret mission into Cambodia and dropped into the country on a UH-1 Huey helicopter. They were to conduct a series of interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh Trail with the assistance of heavy air support.

5|$|In the 1948 season, the White Sox faced {{difficult}} decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In {{the midst of}} Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence {{for most of the}} preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, {{and by the end of}} the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Lua {{affected}} a {{sparsely populated}} region of Western Australia during mid-March 2012. Originating {{in a broad}} low pressure area that formed northwest of Australia by 8 March, the storm was plagued by inhibiting wind shear {{for the duration of}} its formative stages. However, it gradually organised, and received the name Lua on 13 March. The cyclone meandered for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> days of its existence, caught between weak and competing steering currents. After the cyclone drifted northwestward, a building ridge of high pressure to the north drove Lua southeastward toward the Pilbara region. Ultimately intensifying into an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 10-minute winds of 155km/h (100mph), Lua made landfall near the remote community of Pardoo, about 150km (95mi) east of Port Hedland. It steadily weakened as it progressed south over interior Western Australia, diminishing below tropical cyclone status on 18 March.|$|E

5|$|The clade Neoceratopsia {{includes}} all ceratopsians more derived than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called Coronosauria, which currently {{includes all}} ceratopsians more derived than Auroraceratops. Coronosaurs show the first {{development of the}} neck frill and the fusion of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>several</b> neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are generally recognized, although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One group can be called Protoceratopsidae and includes Protoceratops and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, Leptoceratopsidae, includes mostly North American animals that are {{more closely related to}} Leptoceratops. The Ceratopsoidea includes animals like Zuniceratops, which are more closely related to the family Ceratopsidae. This last family includes Triceratops and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies Centrosaurinae and Ceratopsinae (also known as Chasmosaurinae).|$|E

The route continues east from the community, exiting Adirondack Park and crossing over Halfway Creek on its way into the village of Fort Ann, where it becomes Ann Street. Within the village, NY149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two blocks of homes before intersecting with US4 at George Street. NY149 turns to the south, joining US4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann. After passing the town park, US4 and NY149 leave the village and become nameless as they head south into the town of Kingsbury.|$|E
