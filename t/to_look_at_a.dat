5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E
5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in 1953 {{to see if the}} spur {{could be used as a}} part of a commuter line with stops at Merchandise Mart, State Street, and Michigan Avenue, but the plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons. In the 1970s architect Harry Weese suggested a light rail line along the spur to connect Chicago's downtown stations with the River North neighborhoods. In 2008 the City of Chicago Department of Transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> proposal to create a transit link from Union Station and the Ogilvie Transportation Center to Michigan Avenue using the Union Pacific train tunnel running under the Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart and other buildings east toward North Michigan Avenue. The proposed Carroll Avenue Transitway would include the retrofitting of Kinzie Street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly {{in and out of}} focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of triple X women are never diagnosed, unless they undergo tests for other medical reasons later in life. Triple X can be diagnosed by a blood test which is able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> person’s chromosomes (karyotype). Abnormalities on the electroencephalography may be present.|$|E
25|$|The Amsler {{grid test}} {{can be used}} to {{diagnose}} macular degeneration. For this test, patients are asked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> grid, and distortions or blank spots in the patient's central field of vision can be detected. A positive diagnosis of macular degeneration may account for a patient's micropsia.|$|E

25|$|The {{illusion}} {{had been}} maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence {{of those whose}} job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.|$|E
25|$|With {{the leading}} role {{requiring}} a strong female character to be written for Pasta, composer and librettist met to consider a subject. Much of the initial work fell upon Romani, who had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of possible sources, but by 6 October, a subject had been agreed upon: it would be Christina regina di Svenzia from a play by Alexandre Dumas which had appeared in Paris in 1830.|$|E
25|$|They {{were both}} long and thin, and Ber always wore dandy silk socks - {{he was not}} in the least like a parson <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> <b>A</b> man with ideals that he lived up to-he was big - hearted enough to {{understand}} anyone and had it in him to enjoy vulgar fun as much as any. After we became intimate we often went to stay with the Walkes at St Hilary, as simple as any monastery in its furnishings.|$|E
50|$|This {{involves}} the simultaneous stimulation of two semicircular canals and {{is associated with}} a sudden tilting (forward or backwards) of the pilot's head while the aircraft is turning. This can occur when tilting the head down (<b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> approach chart or to write on the knee pad), or up (<b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> overhead instrument or switch) or sideways. This can produce an overpowering sensation that the aircraft is rolling, pitching, and yawing all at the same time, which can be compared with the sensation of rolling down a hillside. This illusion can make the pilot quickly become disoriented and lose control of the aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|It {{can also}} be {{difficult}} for some people with CVI <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object and reach for {{it at the same}} time. Looking and reaching are sometimes accomplished as two separate acts: look, then look away and reach.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes {{it can be}} {{more useful}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} region of the ROC Curve {{rather than at the}} whole curve. It is possible to compute partial AUC. For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests. Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|The use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were {{implemented}} inside Cadavers brains {{to focus on}} the impact and separation of the brain and skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the FE model. To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created. A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model. There are only a few FE models and they were mostly utilized through sled tests.|$|E
25|$|Now, {{with only}} a few years of schooling, eight-year-old Irving began helping to support his family. He became a {{newspaper}} boy, hawking The Evening Journal. One day while delivering newspapers, according to Berlin’s biographer and friend, Alexander Woollcott, he stopped <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ship departing for China and became so entranced that he didn't see a swinging crane, which knocked him into the river. When he was fished out after going down for the third time, he was still holding in his clenched fist the five pennies he earned that day.|$|E
50|$|Vergence {{movements}} are closely connected to accommodation of the eye. Under normal conditions, changing {{the focus of}} the eyes <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> object <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different distance will automatically cause vergence and accommodation, sometimes known as the accommodation-convergence reflex.|$|R

25|$|England staged two Test trials, {{the first}} in June {{a week before the}} First Test and the second in July a week before the Second Test. It was seven years since England had last played a Test match and there was a winter tour of Australia to come so the {{selectors}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> large number of players to try and quickly establish the best possible team. A total of 35 players were used in the two Test trials and, in the end, England used 19 players in the three Test matches, with as many as 10 making only a single appearance.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students must be able <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> word, form an image of that word in their minds {{and be able to}} recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Betty Dodson, {{who is also}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of the}} leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.|$|E

25|$|Link's first {{military}} sales came as {{a result}} of the Air Mail scandal, when the Army Air Corps took over carriage of U.S. Air Mail. Twelve pilots were killed in a 78-day period due to their unfamiliarity with Instrument Flying Conditions. The large scale loss of life prompted the Air Corps <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of solutions, including Link's pilot trainer. The Air Corps was given a stark demonstration of the potential of instrument training when, in 1934, Link flew in to a meeting in conditions of fog that the Air Corps evaluation team regarded as unflyable. As a result, the Air Corps ordered the first six pilot trainers at $3,500 each.|$|E
25|$|Fakhr Al-Din Al-Turaihi, a Muslim {{scholar who}} lived in the 17th Century C.E, {{believed}} that the archangel Gabriel {{is the head of the}} cherubim. A Hadith in Shiite tradition tells us that Muhammad heard cherubs wailing and crying with sympathy for sinners in Heaven during his night journey, known as Isra and Mi'raj. Other traditions say that cherubs are so bright that the light of one of them could suffice the whole world. When Moses asked God to show him his face, he made one of his cherubs shine upon the mountain, shattering it to pieces. According to this tradition, God was showing Moses that since he could not bear <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cherub, he would not be able to bear looking at God.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> patient on an {{individual}} basis will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and specific treatment plan. Genotyping is the process of obtaining an individual’s DNA sequence by using biological assays. By having a detailed account of an individual’s DNA sequence, their genome can then be compared to a reference genome, like that of the Human Genome Project, to assess the existing genetic variations that can account for possible diseases. A number of private companies, such as 23andMe, Navigenics, and Illumina, have created Direct-to-Consumer genome sequencing accessible to the public. Having this information from individuals can then be applied to effectively treat them. An individual’s genetic make-up also plays a large role in how well they respond to a certain treatment, and therefore, knowing their genetic content can change the type of treatment they receive.|$|E
50|$|Lovely <b>to</b> <b>Look</b> <b>At,</b> <b>an</b> {{adaptation}} of the Broadway musical Roberta, is a 1952 MGM musical film directed by Mervyn LeRoy.
