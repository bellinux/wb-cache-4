40|$|Introduction:&nbsp; The use of {{radioactive}} iodine (131 I) {{has become an}} important adjunct {{to the treatment of}} thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. Salivary gland has the ability to concentrate radioactive iodine under normal circumstances. Salivary gland dysfunction and dry mouth are the common side effects of high-dose radioiodine therapy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the absorbed dose of salivary glands. Methods: Twenty patients who were divided into two groups of 10 were studied (A group without pilocarpine and the B group received pilocarpine during treatment). The absorbed dose of parotid glands and the submandibular glands of patients was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) at three different times (24 hours, 8 days and 3 months after treatment). The attenuation coefficient of patients and the effects of pilocarpine were also determined. Results: In group A <b>total</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> was 0. 335, 0. 323, and 0. 357 for parotid glands and the right and left submandibular glands, respectively. In group B <b>total</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> was 0. 462, 0. 482, and 0. 514 for parotid glands and the right and left submandibular glands, respectively.

Conclusion: The findings showed that the dose decreases to 1 cGy after 3 half life of Iodine therapy.

However, the contribution of individual structural elements of cartilage on OCT signal has not been thoroughly studied. We hypothesize that both collagen and chondrocytes, essential structural components of cartilage, act as important light scatterers and that variation in their concentrations can be detected by OCT through changes in backscattering and attenuation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we established a controlled model system using agarose scaffolds embedded with variable collagen concentrations and chondrocyte densities. Using OCT, we measured the backscattering coefficient (µb) and <b>total</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (µt) in these scaffolds.

The integral scintillation efficiency of about 22 % of that of the Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 scintillator was obtained under X-ray irradiation. The light yield and its dependence on the integration time were measured and {{compared with that of}} the Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 crystal. The <b>total</b> mass <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> at 662 keV γ-rays was also determined and compared with the theoretical one calculated using the WinXCom program. ? 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R

The measurements, in the region from 36. 847 to 57. 142 keV, were done in a transmission geometry utilizing the Kα 2, Kα 1, Kβ 1 and Kβ 2 X-rays from different secondary source targets excited by the 59. 54 keV gamma-photons from an Am- 241 annular source. This paper presents the first measurement of the effective atomic numbers and electron densities for some samarium compounds near the K edge. The {{results of the study}} showed that the measured values were in good agreement with the theoretically calculated ones. Atatürk University Research Fund under Project No(s). 2011 / 8...|$|R

Three optical water types were identified based on the spatial vanability of phytoplanktOn pigment in the euphotic zone and conesponding profile of physical parameters along with <b>total</b> beam <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Ct(m 1) and diffuse <b>attenuation</b> <b>coeffIcient,</b> Kj (m'). The derived pigment specific particulate beam <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (c*) diffuse <b>attenuation</b> aefficients (K*d) were effectively used to identify optical stations under dominant influence of non-chlorophyll substances. The pigment specific coeffIcients were mpared with the xefficients repoited from typical case I waters (mostly temperate) and polar wateis as well. Significant variations from temperate model and agreement with polar region model are discussed. Chlorophyll remote sensing model was examined with two sets of reflectance, R (?) and sub-suiface upwelling radiance, L () nilios (441 / 565 and 520 / 565). The typical case I water remote sensing algorithm and the algonthm deiived from present analysis were implemented on the CZCS image, and satellite deñved chlorophyll values were compared with in situ estimates available {{in the same area}} from the Fklish BIOMASS-FIBEX expedition. The results point to the need of more critical study on the bio-optical aspects before implementation of local algorithms for this region on ocean color image...|$|R
