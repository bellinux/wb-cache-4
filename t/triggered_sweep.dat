50|$|Variations in triggered-sweep {{oscilloscopes}} include models offered with CRTs using long-persistence phosphors, such as type P7. These oscilloscopes {{were used}} for applications where the horizontal trace speed was very slow, or {{there was a long}} delay between sweeps, to provide a persistent screen image. Oscilloscopes without <b>triggered</b> <b>sweep</b> could also be retro-fitted with <b>triggered</b> <b>sweep</b> using a solid-state circuit developed by Harry Garland and Roger Melen in 1971.|$|E
25|$|To display {{events with}} un{{changing}} or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but occurring at times {{that may not}} be evenly spaced, modern oscilloscopes have <b>triggered</b> <b>sweeps.</b> Compared to simpler oscilloscopes with sweep oscillators that are always running, triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more versatile.|$|R
25|$|<b>Triggered</b> <b>sweeps</b> {{can display}} a blank screen {{if there are}} no triggers. To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates {{free-running}} triggers so a trace is always visible. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers. Automatic sweep mode can be de-selected when observing low repetition rates.|$|R
25|$|With <b>triggered</b> <b>sweeps,</b> {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets {{completely}} and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next <b>trigger</b> starts a <b>sweep.</b> The <b>trigger</b> event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|R

50|$|Oscilloscopes {{became a}} much more useful tool in 1946 when Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock {{introduced}} the Tektronix Model 511 triggered-sweep oscilloscope. Howard Vollum had first seen this technology in use in Germany. The <b>triggered</b> <b>sweep</b> has a circuit that develops the driven sweep's drive pulse from the input signal.|$|E
50|$|Triggering allows {{stationary}} {{display of}} a repeating waveform, as multiple repetitions of the waveform are drawn over {{exactly the same}} trace on the phosphor screen. A <b>triggered</b> <b>sweep</b> maintains the calibration of sweep speed, {{making it possible to}} measure properties of the waveform such as frequency, phase, rise time, and others, that would not otherwise be possible. Furthermore, triggering can occur at varying intervals, so there is no requirement that the input signal be periodic.Triggered-sweep oscilloscopes compare the vertical deflection signal (or rate of change of the signal) with an adjustable threshold, referred to as trigger level. As well, the trigger circuits also recognize the slope direction of the vertical signal when it crosses the threshold—whether the vertical signal is positive-going or negative-going at the crossing. This is called trigger polarity. When the vertical signal crosses the set trigger level and in the desired direction, the trigger circuit unblanks the CRT and starts an accurate linear sweep. After the completion of the horizontal sweep, the next sweep will occur when the signal once again crosses the threshold trigger.|$|E

50|$|Since DuMont was {{a leader}} in cathode ray tube or CRT design and manufacturing, {{it was a natural}} step to use the CRT as a visual {{measuring}} instrument or oscilloscope. The production of CRT's and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories located in Upper Montclair, NJ. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934. Although not the inventor of the oscilloscope, DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (he called them oscillographs) for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the <b>trigger</b> <b>sweep</b> oscilloscope using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the silicon controlled rectifier or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to show a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the measurement being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided stability in viewing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{profits from}} the {{oscillographs}} helped him invest in television design and his DuMont TV Network. Unfortunately the time spent on his TV ventures {{proved to be the}} end of his profitable oscillograph business. [...] In 1947 a young equipment manufacturer called Tektronix produced the model 511 Time Base <b>Trigger</b> and <b>Sweep</b> Oscilloscope for $795. [...] The use of time instead of frequency to measure a sweep across the CRT was Tektronix's big selling point. Time measurements are easier to interpret pulses and complex waveforms. [...] It has been mentioned informally that Allen DuMont saw the model 511 demonstrated at an electronics show. He tried it and was impressed, but commented to Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock, co-founders of Tektronix that it was too expensive and they would be lucky to sell any. [...] Tektronix's time base <b>trigger</b> and time <b>sweep</b> generator design would become the standard in the 1950s and into the 21st century. Tektronix would replace DuMont Oscillographs as the leading selling oscilloscope brand.|$|R

5000|$|The company traces {{its roots}} to the {{electronics}} revolution that immediately followed World War II. The company’s founders C. Howard Vollum and Melvin J. [...] "Jack" [...] Murdock invented the world’s first triggered oscilloscope in 1946, a significant technological breakthrough. This oscilloscope touted by Tektronix was the model 511. The model 511 was a <b>triggering</b> with <b>sweep</b> oscilloscope. The first oscilloscope with a true time-base was the Tektronix Model 513. [...] The leading oscilloscope manufacturer {{at the time}} was DuMont Laboratories. DuMont pioneered the frequency-synch <b>trigger</b> and <b>sweep.</b> Allen DuMont personally tried the 511 at an electronics show and was impressed, but when he saw the price of $795, which was about twice as much as his equivalent model, he told Howard Vollum at the show that they {{would have a hard time}} to sell many. Tektronix was incorporated in 1946 with its headquarters at SE Foster Road and SE 59th Avenue in Portland, Oregon. In 1947 there were 12 employees, and 250 in 1951. By 1950 the company began building a manufacturing facility in Washington County, Oregon, at Barnes Road and the Sunset Highway, and expanded the facility by 1956 to 80000 sq ft. The company then moved its headquarters to this site, following an employee vote.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{oscilloscopes}} offer these—the {{sweep circuit}} is manually armed (typically by a pushbutton or equivalent) [...] "Armed" [...] means it's ready {{to respond to}} a <b>trigger.</b> Once the <b>sweep</b> is complete, it resets, and will not sweep until re-armed. This mode, combined with an oscilloscope camera, captures single-shot events.|$|R
50|$|The {{power supply}} is an {{important}} component of the oscilloscope. It provides low voltages to power the cathode heater in the tube (isolated for high voltage!), and the vertical and horizontal amplifiers as well as the <b>trigger</b> and <b>sweep</b> circuits. Higher voltages are needed to drive the electrostatic deflection plates, which means that the output stage of the vertical deflection amplifier has to develop large signal swings. These voltages must be very stable, and amplifier gain must be correspondingly stable. Any significant variations will cause errors in the size of the trace, making the oscilloscope inaccurate.|$|R

They are forced to seek refuge on the island in order to escape a waterfall the river empties into, and are helped by a mysterious, giant white dog. Trying to leave, they find that they cannot fly or swim away from the island due to a magical barrier in place around it, which also nullifies magic.

All DuMont oscilloscopes in the late 1950s and after the Fairchild acquisition were using the time base <b>trigger</b> and time <b>sweep</b> generator method introduced by Tektronix.

5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate.

5000|$|If a SPAD is {{observed}} by an analogue curve-tracer, {{it is possible}} to observe a bifurcation of the current-voltage characteristics beyond breakdown, during the voltage sweeps applied to the device. When the avalanche is triggered, the SPAD sustains the avalanche current (on-branch), instead when no carrier has been generated (by a photon or a thermal generation), no charge flows through the SPAD (off-branch). If the SPAD is <b>triggered</b> during a <b>sweep</b> above breakdown, a transition from the off-branch to the on-branch can be easily observed (like a [...] "flickering").|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, an eye pattern, {{also known}} as an eye diagram, is an {{oscilloscope}} display in which a digital signal from a receiver is repetitively sampled and applied to the vertical input, while the data rate is used to <b>trigger</b> the horizontal <b>sweep.</b> It is so called because, for several types of coding, the pattern looks {{like a series of}} eyes between a pair of rails. It is a tool for the evaluation of the combined effects of channel noise and intersymbol interference on the performance of a baseband pulse-transmission system. It is the synchronised superposition of all possible realisations of the signal of interest viewed within a particular signaling interval.|$|R
50|$|On {{board the}} aircraft, the {{signals from the}} three {{stations}} were received {{and sent to the}} 'A-type' display. A local oscillator of much less complexity than the one at the master station was used to <b>trigger</b> the display <b>sweep,</b> and when first activated it would be unlikely to have exactly the same timing as the master station. So when it was first turned on, the operator would see a repeating pattern of blips travelling rapidly across the screen. A control was used to tune the local oscillator frequency until the blips on the display stopped moving, which meant the local and master oscillators now had the same timing.|$|R

Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s (1957-58), Tektronix {{set a new}} trend in {{oscilloscope}} applications that would continue into the 1980s. This was {{the introduction of the}} plug-in oscilloscope. Started with the 530 and 540 series oscilloscopes, the operator could switch in different horizontal sweep or vertical input plug-ins. This allowed the oscilloscope to be a flexible or adaptable test instrument. Later Tektronix would add in plug-ins to have the scope operate as a spectrum analyzer, waveform sampler, cable tester and transistor curve tracer. The 530 and 540 series also ushered in the delayed trigger, allowing to <b>trigger</b> between a <b>sweep</b> rather than at the beginning. This allows more stable triggering and better waveform reproduction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new generic filtering algorithm that simultaneously considers n conjunctions of constraints {{as well as}} those constraints mentioning some variables Y_k of the pairs (X,Y_k) (1 <= k <= n) occurring in these conjunctions. The main benefit of this new technique comes from the fact that, for adjusting the bounds of a variable X according to n conjunctions, we do not perform n sweeps in an independent way but rather synchronize them. We then specialize this technique to the non-overlapping rectangles constraint where we consider the case where several rectangles of height one have the same X coordinate for their origin as well as the same length. For this specific constraint we come up with an incremental bipartite matching algorithm which is <b>triggered</b> while we <b>sweep</b> over the time axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this new pruning method on a timetabling problem, where each task can’t be interrupted and requires the simultaneous availability of n distinct persons. Each person has his own periods of unavailability and can only perform one task at a time...|$|R
40|$|Neurons in the {{superficial}} gray layer (SGS) {{of the superior}} colliculus receive visual input and excite intermediate layer (SGI) neurons that {{play a critical role}} in initiating rapid orienting movements of the eyes, called saccades. In the present study, two types of experiments demonstrate that a population of SGI neurons gives rise to a reciprocal pathway that inhibits neurons in SGS. First, in GAD 67 -GFP knockin mice, GABAergic SGI neurons that expressed GFP fluorescence were injected with the tracer biocytin to reveal their axonal projections. Axons arising from GFP-positive neurons in SGI terminated densely in SGS. Next, SGI neurons in rats and mice were stimulated by using the photolysis of caged glutamate, and in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to measure the responses evoked in SGS cells. Large, synaptically mediated outward currents were evoked in SGS neurons. These currents were blocked by gabazine, confirming that they were GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This inhibitory pathway from SGI transiently suppresses visual activity in SGS, which in turn could have multiple effects. These effects could include reduction of perceptual blurring during saccades as well as prevention of eye movements that might be spuriously <b>triggered</b> by the <b>sweep</b> of the visual field across the retina...|$|R
40|$|Successive {{stages in}} the reinnervation of denervated muscle fibers {{following}} a complete or partial motor nerve lesion in humans were analyzed with the concentric needle electrode during voluntary contraction. Motor unit potential (MUP) patterns were displayed by coherent EMG, in which the potential <b>triggers</b> an oscilloscope <b>sweep</b> and a digital delay line enables {{the early part of}} the MUP to be displayed. After a complete nerve lesion, MUPs showing the response of as few as one to three muscle fibers can be observed. MUPs become highly polyphasic as more muscle fibers are incorporated. Marked latency jitter and intermittent blocking of components as well as the occurrence of linked potentials result in complex patterns that may be confused with a 'myopathic' pattern of brief small spikes if conventional observation of free-running sweeps is used alone. After a partial nerve lesion, the healthy motor axons achieve extensive collateral reinnervation of the denervated muscle fibers whereby linked potentials of various latencies are added after the original MUP. Adequate understanding of these characteristic features can help clarify some current issues in electromyography. The mechanisms by which long-latency linked potentials and desynchronized components are produced during remodeling of motor units in the course of regeneration involve a number of factors such as slow conduction along regenerated axon branches, ectopic motor end-plates, insecure neuromuscular transmission, and muscle fiber atrophy.

30|$|The SSR was {{recorded}} from the palmar surface of both {{left and right}} hands for patients and control groups (240 hands in total). We used surface electrodes (Ag- Ag Cl) and Nihon Khoden machine (Neuropack X 1, MEB 2300, 6 and 12 channels EMG/EP Measuring System, easy database management with Neuro-Work-bench software). The active electrode {{was placed on the}} palmar aspects of the hands, above the third metacarpal bones (at 3 [*]cm from the distal end). The reference electrode was placed on the corresponding area of the dorsal aspect of the examined hand. The ground electrode was placed at the distal skin crease at the wrist area. All subjects were stimulated at the median nerve at the wrist ipsilateral to the recording electrode. Each stimulus consisted of a single electric pulse (width 0.5 [*]ms). The stimulus intensity was set to be 1.5 times the motor threshold of the stimulated nerve, and it was delivered at the wrist at an irregular interval (30 to 35 [*]s). The traces were recorded from 0.5 [*]s before to 8 [*]s after the <b>trigger</b> stimulus. The <b>sweep</b> speed was 1000  ms/D. The amplifiers’ sensitivity was 100  μV/div, and the amplifier filters were set at 0.5  Hz and 2  kHz for the low- and high-frequency filters respectively. Five trials were recorded from the palm with the largest amplitude, and shortest latency was taken. Peak-to-peak amplitude is measured, and latency was measured at the start point of either initial negativity or positivity of the baseline. To minimize noise from spontaneous potentials, the operator monitored the baseline on an oscilloscope before releasing the electric stimulus. Recording long latency responses (with low-frequency components) requires a very slow sweep (0.5 ~ 1  s per division), a high gain (100  μv per division), and a wide band pass (0.16 ~ 3  kHz).|$|R
40|$|Classical {{physics of}} {{detonation}} assumes the basic configuration of Chapman-Jouguet mechanisms with {{an interaction between}} shock and reaction zones. The Chapman-Jouguet one-dimensional regime (CJ point) obeys to the assumption of the entire flow to be one-dimensional and the front is assumed as a non thickness discontinuity plane, where conservation laws for shock waves (mass, momentum and energy) are applied. This last assumption simplifies detonation measurements implying, as basic values, detonation velocity and pressure. Radiation assumptions and measurements, coupled with described analytical model, led to develop a multi-channel optical analyzer - multi-fiber optical probes (MFOP). Despite {{the last fifteen years}} passed, since MFOP was developed, it remains, up to the present, a very complex diagnostic technique that offers a complex compromise between high temporal/spatial resolutions. However, their design stays complex and a fast streak camera is always a condition to record the results. Also the <b>triggering</b> mechanisms and <b>sweep</b> time evaluations stay as delicate operations. These conclusions lead us to develop a more simplified method, based in single optical fibers and fast optical/electric sensors connected to a digital signal analyzer. Two kinds of optical multimode fibers can be used in these measurements: PMMA and silica fibers. In a similar way, two kinds of opto-electronic receivers can be used, as a function of optical range: maximum sensibility at 650 and 850 nm. Sensors were selected to have rise time less than 50 ns. Opto-electronic converters were designed and built. Best results were achieved for PMMA multimode optic fiber, connected to an analog 650 nm receiver. The used tested explosive was a PETN detonating cord. Records were obtained and an example of detonation velocity measurement is shown. Results show promising possibilities. More complex configurations and results, coupling preceding methods and results, will be tested in future. Obtained results prove the validity of presented experimental method...|$|R
5000|$|The sweep {{technique}} is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique. A plot of, for example, response amplitude versus the check {{size of a}} stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds, far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes.In the original demonstration of the technique the sine and cosine products were fed through lowpass filters (as when recording a SSEP [...] ) while viewing a pattern of fine checks whose black and white squares exchanged place six times per second. Then {{the size of the}} squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size (hence [...] "sweep"). Subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency.A single sweep may be adequate or {{it may be necessary to}} average the graphs obtained in several sweeps with the averager <b>triggered</b> by the <b>sweep</b> cycle. Averaging 16 sweeps can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the graph by a factor of four.The sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies, where recording duration is necessarily short. Norcia and Tyler have used the technique to document the development of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity through the first years of life. They have emphasized that, in diagnosing abnormal visual development, the more precise the developmental norms, the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal, and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants. For many years the sweep technique has been used in paediatric ophthalmology (electrodiagnosis) clinics worldwide.|$|R
