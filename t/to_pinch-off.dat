40|$|A {{new regime}} of droplet {{ejection}} following the slow deposition of drops onto a near-complete wetting solid substrate is identified in experiments and direct numerical simulations; a coalescence cascade subsequent <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> is also observed {{for the first}} time. Results of numerical simulations indicate that the propagation of capillary waves that lead <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> {{is closely related to}} the self-similar behaviour observed in the inviscid recoil of droplets, and that motions of the crests and troughs of capillary waves along the interface do not depend on the wettability and surface tension (or Ohnesorge number). The simulations also show that a self-similar theory for universal pinch-off can be used for the time evolution of the pinching neck. However, although good agreement is also found with the double-cone shape of the pinching neck for droplet ejection in drop deposition on a pool of the same liquid, substantial deviations are observed in such a comparison for droplet ejection in rapid drop spreading (including the newly identified regime). This deviation is shown to result from interference by the solid substrate, a rapid downwards acceleration of the top of the drop surface and the rapid spreading process. The experiments also confirm non-monotonic spreading behaviour observed previously only in numerical simulations, and suggest substantial inertial effects on the relation between an apparent contact angle and the dimensionless contact-line speed. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|E

30|$|In {{this review}} we have {{described}} a saturating I–V characteristic in graphene devices operated at high source-drain bias, {{and described the}} behavior using a model where surface phonon emission results in a carrier velocity that saturates to a Fermi energy dependent value at high applied electric field.

This effect results from {{the introduction of the}} charge neutrality point into the channel, and is similar <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> in MOSFET devices.

40|$|Observations of {{turbulent}} convection in {{the environment}} are of variously sus- tained plume-like flows or intermittent thermal-like flows. At {{different times of the}} day the prevailing conditions may change and consequently the observed flow regimes may change. Understanding the link between these flows is of practical importance meteorologically, and here we focus our interest upon plume-like regimes that break up to form thermal-like regimes. It has been shown that when a plume rises from a boundary with low conductivity, such as arable land, the inability to maintain a rapid enough supply of buoyancy to the plume source can result in the turbulent base of the plume separating and rising away from the source. This plume ‘pinch-off’ marks the onset of the intermittent thermal-like behavior. The dynamics of turbulent plumes in a uniform environment are explored in order to investigate the phenomenon of plume pinch-off. The special case of a turbulent plume having its source completely removed, a ‘stopping plume’, is considered in particular. The effects of forcing a plume <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off,</b> by rapidly reducing the source buoyancy flux to zero, are shown experi- mentally. We release saline solution into a tank filled with fresh water generating downward propagating steady turbulent plumes. By rapidly closing the plume nozzle, the plumes are forced <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off.</b> The plumes are then observed to detach from the source and descend into the ambient. The unsteady buoyant region produced after pinch-off, cannot be described by the power-law behavior of either classical plumes or thermals, and so the terminology ‘stopping plume’ (analogous to a ‘starting plume’) is adopted for this type of flow. The propagation of the stopping plume is shown to be approximately linearly dependent on time, and we speculate therefore that the closure of the nozzle introduces some vorticity into the ambient, that may roll up to form a vortex ring dominating the dynamics of the base of a stopping plume...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{catheter}} “pinch-off syndrome” {{has been}} described to be secondary to crimping of the catheter between the clavicle and the first rib, as well as entrapment of the catheter {{at the site of}} penetration of the subclavius muscle. The lateral insertion technique has been recommended <b>to</b> prevent catheter <b>pinch-off,</b> but it is unknown if this technique can prevent entrapment by the subclavius muscle. We undertook this study to evaluate the anatomical relationship of the subclavius muscle and the subclavian vein. Methods. Twenty-eight adult cadavers were studied on both right and left sides. The adherence between the subclavian vein and subclavius muscle was subjectively assessed and the distance between the two structures was measured in mm. Results. The subclavius muscle and subclavian vein were tightly adherent in 72 % of specimens, partly adherent in 14 % with a mean distance of 4. 5 [*]mm and loosely connected in 14 % with a mean distance of 6. 1 [*]mm. Conclusions. The anatomical relationship between the subclavius muscle and vein was very close in the majority of specimens, suggesting that the lateral insertion technique may not prevent penetration of the muscle, which may contribute <b>to</b> catheter <b>pinch-off.</b> The real-time ultrasound-guided technique may prevent penetration of the subclavius muscle...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{transport}} in mesoscopic conductors {{has traditionally}} involved {{investigations of the}} mean current and the fluctuations of the current. A complementary view on charge transport {{is provided by the}} distribution of waiting times between charge carriers, but a proper theoretical framework for coherent electronic systems has so far been lacking.

We illustrate our methodology by calculating the waiting time distribution for a quantum point contact and find a cross-over from Wigner-Dyson statistics at full transmission to Poisson statistics close <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off.</b> Even when the low-frequency transport is noiseless, the electrons are not equally spaced in time due to their inherent wave nature.

40|$|The electromigration-induced shape {{evolution}} of two-dimensional vacancy islands on a crystal surface is studied using a continuum approach. We consider the regime where mass transport {{is restricted to}} terrace diffusion {{in the interior of}} the island. In the limit of fast attachment/detachment kinetics a circle translating at constant velocity is a stationary solution of the problem. In contrast to earlier work [O. Pierre-Louis and T. L. Einstein, Phys. Rev. B 62, 13697 (2000) ] we show that the circular solution remains linearly stable for arbitrarily large driving forces. The numerical solution of the full nonlinear problem nevertheless reveals a fingering instability at the trailing end of the island, which develops from finite amplitude perturbations and eventually leads <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off.</b> Relaxing the condition of instantaneous attachment/detachment kinetics, we obtain non-circular elongated stationary shapes in an analytic approximation which compares favorably to the full numerical solution.

30|$|The “kink” {{effect in}} {{graphene}} is similar <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> in traditional MOSFETs, where a strong bias voltage pulls the quasi-Fermi level {{at one end}} of the channel into the charge-depleted bandgap. In graphene, where there is no bandgap, this results in a transition within the channel from one carrier type (electrons or holes) to the other. In a device that is n-type, as in Figure 8 (c)(I), a positive source-drain voltage (applied to the source) depletes the electron density in the channel near the source (II). At sufficiently strong positive bias voltage, the bias voltage begins to pull holes into the channel, so a region of the channel is at charge neutrality and contributes a large resistance (III). As bias is further increased, hole density at the source also increases, so conductivity increases again (IV). In Reference [32] we showed that wide plateaus in current could be achieved when this “kink” effect is made to coincide with velocity saturation.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} channel-length {{modulation}} upon the MOSFET output resistance varies {{both with the}} device, particularly its channel length, and with the applied bias. The main factor affecting the output resistance in longer MOSFETs is channel length modulation as just described. In shorter MOSFETs additional factors arise such as: drain-induced barrier lowering (which lowers the threshold voltage, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance), velocity saturation (which tends to limit the increase in channel current with drain voltage, thereby increasing the output resistance) and ballistic transport (which modifies the collection of current by the drain, and modifies drain-induced barrier lowering so as to increase supply of carriers <b>to</b> the <b>pinch-off</b> region, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance). Again, accurate results require computer models.|$|R

40|$|We present {{magnetoresistance}} (MR) {{experiments on}} an InAs nanowire quantum dot device with two ferromagnetic sidegates (FSGs) in a split-gate geometry. The wire segment can be electrically tuned {{to a single}} dot or to a double dot regime using the FSGs and a backgate. In both regimes we find a strong MR and a sharp MR switching of up to 25 % at the field at which the magnetizations of the FSGs are inverted by the external field. The sign and amplitude of the MR and the MR switching can both be tuned electrically by the FSGs. In a double dot regime close <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> we find two sharp transitions in the conductance, reminiscent of tunneling MR (TMR) between two ferromagnetic contacts, with one transition near zero and one at the FSG switching fields. These surprisingly rich characteristics we explain in several simple resonant tunneling models.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a fully tunable realization of a multistate Fano resonance, {{in which a}} pair of remote quantum states experience an effective coupling due to their mutual overlap with a continuum. Our mesoscopic implementation of this system exploits {{the ability of the}} semiconductor nanostructures known as quantum point contacts (QPCs) to serve, in the low-density limit close <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off,</b> as an on-demand localized state. By coupling the states formed on two separate QPCs, through a two-dimensional electron gas that serves as a continuum, we observe a robust effective interaction between the QPCs. To explain this result, we develop a theoretical formulation, based on the ideas of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which is able to reproduce our key experimental findings. According to this model, the robust character of the interaction between the two remote states arises {{from the fact that the}} interaction is essentially mediated by a large number of degenerate continuum states. While the continuum is often viewed as a source of decoherence, our experiment therefore instead suggests the possibility of using this medium to support the interaction of quantum states, a result that may allow new approaches to coherently couple nanostructures in extended geometries...|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain <b>to</b> the <b>pinch-off</b> point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} drop {{detachment}} from a capillary tip and formation of satellite droplets is studied for solutions of trisiloxane surfactants above the critical aggregation concentration. Two of the studied surfactants self-assemble in bilayer based phases, whereas the third forms micelles. The {{difference in the}} aggregates formed results in an essential difference {{in the rate of}} equilibration between the surface and the bulk solution and in a different behaviour near the pinch-off point. The difference in behaviour becomes pronounced when the viscosity of solutions increases 2 – 6 times (and therefore diffusion coefficients decrease correspondingly). In particular, when surfactant solutions are prepared in a water/glycerol mixture with a viscosity six times larger than water, the size of satellite droplets formed by the micellar solutions increases more than twice, whereas the size of droplets formed by the bilayer-forming solutions remains almost constant over a range of concentration covering two orders of magnitude.

As a consequence, vesicle transport is very active during vitellogenesis, and oocytes are an outstanding system to study regulators of membrane trafficking. Here, we combine zebrafish genetics and the oocyte model {{to identify the}} molecular lesion underlying the zebrafish souffle (suf) mutation. We demonstrate that suf encodes the homolog of the Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) gene SPASTIZIN (SPG 15). We show that in zebrafish oocytes suf mutants accumulate Rab 11 b-positive vesicles, but trafficking of recycling endosomes is not affected. Instead, we detect Suf/Spastizin on cortical granules, which undergo regulated secretion. We demonstrate genetically that Suf is essential for granule maturation into secretion competent dense-core vesicles describing a novel role for Suf in vesicle maturation. Interestingly, in suf mutants immature, secretory precursors accumulate, because they fail <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> Clathrin-coated buds.

30|$|We {{present the}} {{electron}} transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at high electric bias conduction. When graphene is patterned {{into a few}} tens of nanometer width of a ribbon shape, the carriers are confined to a quasi-one-dimensional (1 D) system. Combining with the disorders in the system, this quantum confinement can lead into a transport gap in the energy spectrum of the GNRs. Similar to CNTs, this gap depends on {{the width of the}} GNR. In this review, we examine the electronic properties of lithographically fabricated GNRs, focusing on the high bias transport characteristics of GNRs as a function of density tuned by a gate voltage. We investigate the transport behavior of devices biased up to a few volts, a regime more relevant for electronics applications. We find that the high bias transport behavior in this limit can be described by hot electron scattered by the surface phonon emission, leading to a carrier velocity saturation. We also showed an enhanced current saturation effect in the GNRs with an efficient gate coupling. This effect results from the introduction of the charge neutrality point into the channel, and is similar <b>to</b> <b>pinch-off</b> in MOSFET devices.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} electrical and optical properties of GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) biased in a non-destructive breakdown regime. By means {{of a number of}} measurements carried out with varying voltage and temperature conditions, we show that: (i) HEMTs can reach a sustainable breakdown condition, when they are biased in current-controlled mode, with a gate voltage smaller than the pinch-off voltage; (ii) when biased in sustainable breakdown, HEMTs can emit a weak luminescence signal, localized in proximity of the drain edge; (iii) the breakdown voltage (BDV) is strongly dependent on temperature. Through a careful investigation of the drain, source and gate current components, we demonstrate that breakdown originates from two different mechanisms, depending on the gate voltage: for gate voltages close <b>to</b> the <b>pinch-off,</b> breakdown current originates from the space charge injection of electrons from the source to the drain. On the other hand, for more negative gate voltages, breakdown current originates from the injection of electrons from the gate. Finally, the analysis of the temperature dependence of the breakdown current confirms that two different mechanisms significantly contribute to current conduction at high drain voltage level...|$|R
40|$|An {{advection}} [...] diffusion-limited dissolution {{model of}} an object being eroded by a two-dimensional potential flow is presented. By {{taking advantage of the}} conformal invariance of the model, a numerical method is introduced that tracks the evolution of the object boundary in terms of a time-dependent Laurent series. Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink and then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a surprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a non-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent series coefficients describing the initial shape. This result is subsequently derived using residue calculus. The structure of the non-analytic function is examined for three different test cases, and a practical approach to determine the collapse point using a generalized Newton [...] Raphson root-finding algorithm is outlined. These examples also illustrate the possibility that the model breaks down in finite time prior to complete collapse, due to a topological singularity, as the dissolving boundary overlaps itself rather than breaking up into multiple domains (analogous <b>to</b> droplet <b>pinch-off</b> in fluid mechanics). In summary, the model raises fundamental mathematical questions about broken symmetries in finite-time singularities of both continuous and stochastic dynamical systems.
