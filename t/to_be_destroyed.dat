5|$|Disposal of damaged flags is also {{covered by}} the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method {{consistent}} with {{the dignity of the}} flag.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E

5|$|Spindler {{was ordered}} to switch his attacks further south to try to force the British away from the river, {{isolating}} the British from any hope of reinforcement and allowing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Despite their best efforts, however, they were unsuccessful, although the constant artillery and assaults continued to wear the British defences down further.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> rather than simply reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{then joined}} the revolt by Henry's sons in 1173. The attempt to {{overthrow}} Henry was unsuccessful, and in punishment the king ordered several Bigod castles, including Framlingham, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The king's engineer, Alnoth, destroyed the fortifications and {{filled in the}} moat at Framlingham between 1174–6 at a total cost of £16 11s 12d, although he probably shored up, rather than destroyed, the internal stone buildings.|$|E

5|$|In 1221 the castle's owner, William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, {{rebelled against}} Henry III; the {{fortification}} {{was captured by}} royalist forces and the King ordered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The remains of the castle had little value {{by the end of}} the 14th century and Skipsea Brough failed to attract many inhabitants. The castle passed into the control of the state in the early 20th century and various archaeological investigations were carried out between 1987 and 2001. In the 21st century, Skipsea Castle is managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{murdered his}} wife Nellie {{sometime}} between May 16 {{and the morning}} of May 18, 1927; she had just been discharged from the hospital with an undefined illness.

5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> due {{to their}} {{decrepit}} conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E
5|$|Representing himself {{during the}} hearing, he {{admitted}} the violation but {{pleaded not guilty}} and hinted at conspiracies. During a recess the judge apparently suggested a psychiatric evaluation to Reich's ex-wife, Ilse Ollendorff, {{but this was not}} communicated to Reich. The jury found him guilty on 7 May 1956, and he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Silvert was sentenced to a year and a day, the Wilhelm Reich Foundation was fined $10,000, and the accumulators and associated literature were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b>|$|E

Strong waves also cause beach erosion and several homes along the shore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Due to well-executed warnings, damages are extremely low, and it is reported that no deaths result from the storm.|$|E

5|$|The German Imperial Navy {{began its}} second {{submarine}} offensive in February 1916, declaring, among other provisions, that all enemy {{vessels in the}} war zone were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed</b> without warning. On 26 February 1916, UB-2 torpedoed and sank the cargo ship Arbonne, in what was ultimately her last wartime success.

5|$|The Predator {{travels through}} {{rural and urban}} areas of Gunnison, {{fighting}} more Aliens along the way, and occasionally being harassed by human soldiers and civilians. Finally, the main Alien lair is found in a hospital, where several mines are set by the Predator to bring the Hive down. The game concludes with the final fight against an attacking helicopter and the hospital's destruction. Suddenly, the Alien Queen is seen appearing out of the hospital's rubble, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed,</b> along with the entire town, by a nuclear warhead, while the Predator successfully leaves Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Uhud {{is the second}} of the two main battles {{featured}} in Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film centering on the life of Muhammad, Mohammad, Messenger of God.

The cave in Mount Uhud where Muhammad rested temporarily during the battle has also received recent media attention in the light of proposals by some Islamic scholars for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>destroyed.</b>|$|E
