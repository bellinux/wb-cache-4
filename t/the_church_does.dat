5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not {{recognise}} divorce as {{ending a}} valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> {{not require}} that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E

5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{not control}} its members strictly. Rituals such as weddings and {{funerals}} are often {{considered to be}} the most important reasons to remain a member.|$|E

50|$|Mount Pleasant Chapel, on Hammerton Street, {{was founded}} in 1858 and closed in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not have a graveyard. In 1858 members of the Sion Chapel took a room in Keighley Green {{to form a new}} society, and in 1868 the chapel was bought from the United Methodists by the new Baptist Society. In 1997 it moved to Rosehill Road (see below). <b>The</b> <b>church</b> {{published}} a Jubilee souvenir for 1868-1968. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not have a graveyard.|$|R

50|$|Some members owned slaves—the {{most famous}} of whom was Sojourner Truth—and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not support abolitionism. In rural areas, ministers preached in Dutch until about 1830 - 1850, then {{switched}} to English, {{at the same time}} finally dropping the use of many traditional Dutch clothing and customs. Although some ministers favored revivals, generally <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not support either the First or the Second Great Awakenings, which created much evangelical fervor.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> {{not exist}} {{to provide an}} ethos for {{democracy}} or {{any other form of}} social organization, but stands as a political alternative to every nation, witnessing to the kind of social life possible for those that have been formed by the story of Christ.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{not approve}} {{of the use of}} {{abortion}} as a means of birth control or family planning, but recognizes a woman's right to receive one. Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's physical or mental health is at risk. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix {{issued the}} fourth {{edition of his}} guide, Catholics in the Public Square. In it, he {{suggested}} to politicians supporting abortion that {{they would need to}} repent and go to Confession before receiving Holy Communion, dissenting from most other bishops including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Cardinal Donald Wuerl who said <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not deny communion over issues of legislation.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not {{consider}} at all illicit {{the use of}} those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result therefrom, {{so long as the}} contraceptive effect is not directly intended for any motive whatsoever. For example, the use of hormonal contraception as treatment for endometriosis rather than with contraceptive intent is {{not consider}}ed to conflict in any way with Catholic teaching.|$|E
25|$|According to Latter Day Saint scripture, {{a bishop}} in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> {{not need to}} be a high priest nor does he need counselors if he is a Levite and a direct {{descendant}} of Aaron, the brother of Moses. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), apostle Joseph Fielding Smith taught that this provision applied only to the Presiding Bishop of the church and not to bishops of wards.|$|E
25|$|Members claim <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} a formal organization. Members do not {{participate}} in, and many are unaware of, the church's governance. Although {{in the early years}} of the church, a headquarters was maintained in Belfast, no official headquarters currently exist and the church remains largely unincorporated. Both expenditures and funds collected remain secret from the membership and no accounting is made public. Funds are handled through stewardships, trusts, and cash transactions.|$|E
50|$|Bethel Chapel, on Hammerton Street, {{opened in}} 1852. In 1932 it {{closed and the}} {{building}} was sold to <b>the</b> Christian Science <b>Church.</b> <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not have a graveyard.|$|R
50|$|Immanuel Chapel, on Bright Street, {{was founded}} in 1895 and closed in 1970. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not have a graveyard. The {{building}} is now in commercial use.|$|R
50|$|The chapel bears {{a sign in}} Latin stating NON GODE L’IMMUNITA ECCLESIAS, {{meaning that}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not offer {{sanctuary}} to criminal offenders who sought asylum within <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> something common at that time.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{not require}} married clergy who are {{converts}} to cease their ministry if it considers their ordination valid. And celibacy {{has never been}} regarded as a divine law for priests. Francis expressed his openness to consider having some older married men ordained, especially in mission areas where there is an extreme shortage of priests. Consistent with his idea of collegiality, he chose {{to wait for the}} conferences of bishops to request this in the light of local situations.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{recognize}} that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.|$|E
25|$|Members who are {{not living}} in {{accordance}} with the doctrines taught in the INC are admonished. Those who continue in violation of INC doctrines after being admonished are excommunicated or expelled from the INC and thus lose salvation, and therefore, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not believe in the perseverance of the saints. Certain violations, such as eating blood, being absent from worship services too long without any solid reason, or marrying or having a romantic relationship with a non-member may result in mandatory excommunication.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not {{continue}} long after Botkin's death {{from a heart}} attack in December 1969, but some of his followers went on to join neopagan movements with beliefs drawing from <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Aphrodite.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not nationally {{allow the}} {{ordination}} of gay or lesbian pastors, but some Jurisdictions and Annual Conferences have begun to ordain gay and lesbian pastors and same-sex marriages or have passed resolutions supporting such ceremonies. The Baltimore-Washington, California-Nevada, California-Pacific, Desert Southwest, Detroit, Greater New Jersey, Great Plains, Illinois Great Rivers, Iowa, Minnesota, New England, New York, Northern Illinois, Oregon-Idaho, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, Southwest Texas, Upper New York, Virginia, West Michigan, and Wisconsin Annual Conferences have passed resolutions supporting same-sex couples or {{the ordination of}} gay and lesbian clergy.|$|E
25|$|In general, the LDS Church {{distances}} {{itself from}} politics, although it encourages {{its members to}} be politically active. Each summer in U.S. election years the church sends a letter to each bishop to be read over the pulpit stating that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not endorse any political parties or candidates, does not allow its buildings {{to be used for}} political events, and that no titles or positions that a person may have in the church may be used to imply church endorsement of any party or candidate.|$|E
25|$|In the Orthodox Church {{the use of}} the menorah {{has been}} preserved, always {{standing}} on or behind the altar in the sanctuary. Though candles may be used, the traditional practice is to use olive oil in the seven-lamp lampstand. There are varying liturgical practices, and usually all seven lamps are lit for the services, though sometimes only the three centermost are lit for the lesser services. If <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not have a sanctuary lamp the centermost lamp of the seven lamps may remain lit as an eternal flame.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>did</b> {{not form}} new dioceses to fit with this, instead three vicariates general were created, often {{with their own}} {{auxiliary}} bishop, to accommodate the three regional entities.|$|R
