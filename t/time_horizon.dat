25|$|Hof et al. (2008) (referred to by World Bank, 2010:8) {{examined}} {{the sensitivity of}} the optimal climate target to assumptions about the <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> climate sensitivity, mitigation costs, likely damages, and discount rates. The optimal target was defined as the concentration that would result in the lowest reduction in the present value (i.e., discounted) of global consumption. A set of assumptions that included a relatively high climate sensitivity (i.e., a relatively large global temperature increase for a given increase in GHGs), high damages, a long <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> low discount rates (i.e., future consumption is valued relatively highly), and low mitigation costs, produced an optimum peak in the concentration of CO2e at 540 parts per million (ppm). Another set of assumptions that assumed a lower climate sensitivity (lower global temperature increase), lower damages, a shorter <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> and a higher discount rate (present consumption is valued relatively more highly), produced an optimum peaking at 750ppm.|$|E

50|$|Carstensen {{originally}} formulated socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) in {{the early}} 1990s. SST is a life-span theory of motivation which posits that people prioritize emotionally meaningful goals when <b>time</b> <b>horizons</b> are constrained. According to SST, people with expansive <b>time</b> <b>horizons</b> {{are more likely to}} prioritize exploration and expanding horizons, seeking out new relationships that promise long-term benefits. In contrast, as <b>time</b> <b>horizons</b> grow limited people prioritize emotionally meaningful goals that are more likely to result in feelings of emotional satisfaction.

25|$|On February 3, 2010, EPA {{finalized}} the Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2) for 2010 and beyond. EPA incorporated {{direct emissions}} and significant indirect emissions such as emissions from land use changes along with comments and data from new studies. Adopting a 30-year <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> and a 0% discount rate EPA declared that ethanol produced from corn starch {{at a new}} (or expanded capacity from an existing) natural gas-fired facility using approved technologies would be considered {{to comply with the}} 20% GHG emission reduction threshold. Given average production conditions it expected for 2022, EPA estimated that corn ethanol would reduce GHGs an average of 21% compared to the 2005 gasoline baseline. A 95% confidence interval spans a 7-32% range reflecting uncertainty in the land use change assumptions.|$|E
25|$|Two 2008 studies, both {{published}} {{in the same issue}} of Scienceexpress, questioned the previous assessments. A team led by Searchinger from Princeton University concluded that once direct and indirect effect of land use changes (ILUC) are considered, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. The study limited the analysis to a 30-year <b>time</b> <b>horizon,</b> assuming that land conversion emitted 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur as a result of diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each natural land converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|EPA's draft {{analysis}} {{stated that}} ILUC can produce significant near-term GHG emissions due to land conversion, but that biofuels can pay these back over subsequent years. EPA highlighted two [...] scenarios, varying the <b>time</b> <b>horizon</b> and {{the discount rate}} for valuing emissions. The first assumed a 30-year time period uses a 0 percent discount rate (valuing emissions equally regardless of timing). The second scenario used a 100-year time period and a 2% discount rate.|$|E
