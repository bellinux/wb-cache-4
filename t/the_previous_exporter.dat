By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> advantage Hawaiian <b>exporters</b> enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Liliuokalani proposed a lottery and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.|$|R

Our results indicate that multinational firms dominate Japanese trade. In 2000, only 12. 4 percent of Japanese firms were multinationals but they accounted for 93. 6 and 81. 2 percent of Japanese exports and imports, respectively. We found that multinational firms emerged from being exporters/importers. These results imply that firms do not make the choice of either exporting or undertaking FDI, contrary to <b>the</b> findings of <b>previous</b> studies. Rather, <b>exporters</b> {{make a decision on}} whether or not to undertake FDI. ...|$|R
