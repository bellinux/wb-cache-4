In chapter two, I defend the claim that knowing all <b>the</b> physical <b>truths</b> is not sufficient for knowing all <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world. In addition to mounting a prima facie case for the knowledge intuition, I present and defend an epistemology grounded in direct acquaintance to provide a more substantive argument to accept it. Chapters three through five address the physicalist objections to the Knowledge Argument. The first set of objections advocates that knowing all <b>the</b> physical <b>truths</b> is, in fact, sufficient for knowing all <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world. The next set of objections admits that there is some sense in which knowing all <b>the</b> physical <b>truths</b> is not sufficient for knowing all <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world. However, these objections maintain that the kind of knowledge that is absent from the complete set of physical truths is know-how or knowledge by acquaintance, and not factual or propositional knowledge. The final set of objections maintain that the kind of propositional knowledge that is left out of the complete set of physical truths is compatible with physicalism. My response to these objections is part of advancing my prima facie case for the Knowledge Argument. The final chapter addresses a structural question that pertains to the Knowledge Argument. Some philosophers have maintained that the structure of the Knowledge Argument invites a kind of self-refutation of any systematic account of reality. The concern is that the Knowledge Argument proves too much, and that the dualist who uses the argument to refute physicalism risks the argument defeating his own position. I will argue that the Knowledge Argument does not refute dualism...|$|R

5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang {{in crystal}} stasis within the pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline.
