5|$|Kevin McNally {{was cast}} as the {{antagonist}} Robert Osbourne; McNally was chosen because the producers <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> perfect to play the part, {{as is the case}} with Debra Stephenson, who portrayed his wife. Child actor Daniel Chenery, who played the part of their son, Sammy, was chosen due to his likeness of a younger version of McNally. Also, Simon Crawford Collins's wife made a cameo appearance as a BT operator.|$|E
5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of}} his life, but the general election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E

5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} music career took off, began {{receiving}} offers for acting roles. He turned down every request until 1994, {{when he was}} offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received {{an increasing number of}} calls from directors who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.|$|E
5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, and he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck {{said it was not}} his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village.|$|E

5|$|England {{lost their}} leg spinner Doug Wright before the match to lumbago, so the off spin of Jim Laker {{was brought in}} at late notice. Laker had {{struggled}} when he had played for Surrey and the MCC against Australia in the lead-up matches, taking 1/137 and 3/127 respectively. In the MCC match, the Australians had attacked him, taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82-minute passage of play. Of the team that took to {{the field for the}} MCC, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, captain Norman Yardley, Laker and Jack Young were also selected for the First Test. Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings. Young had bowled 55.2 overs in Australia's only innings, taking 4/155. Opener Jack Robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck, and Cyril Washbrook, who had played against Australia in the 1946–47 series, partnered Hutton. Joe Hardstaff junior had scored 107 for Nottinghamshire, the only century made against Australia in the lead-up matches, earning himself Test selection. Paceman Alec Bedser did not play in the MCC match, but had been a regular during England's last series against Australia in 1946–47, and had taken 4/104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists. Godfrey Evans, who kept wickets in the previous Ashes series, also gained Test selection. According to former England bowler Bill Bowes, England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers. The home team's bowlers would tie down the Australians, forcing the batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal; however, if rain produced a sticky wicket, the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily. As such, England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers, Laker, Bedser and Young, and relied on Yardley, Edrich and Charlie Barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling. It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers; the all-rounder George Pope was in the squad and it was <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used in place of one of the bowlers, but in the end, he was omitted, as was Reg Simpson. The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man.|$|E

25|$|In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to disband {{his army}} {{and return to}} Rome because his term as Proconsul had finished. Moreover, the Senate forbade Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia. Caesar <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted and {{politically}} marginalised if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a Consul or without {{the power of his}} army. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. On 10 January 49 BC Caesar crossed the Rubicon river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only one legion and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon, Plutarch reports that Caesar quoted the Athenian playwright Menander in Greek, saying anerrhiphthō kubos (ἀνερρίφθω κύβος; let the dice be tossed). Suetonius gives the Latin approximation alea iacta est (the die has been tossed).|$|E

25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E
25|$|Jiangling was {{initially}} situated on flat lands {{and was a}} very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian (張咸) to oversee {{the construction of a}} large dyke to block the river flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu's plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang's officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing so because they <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> doing the enemy a favour, but Lu ignored them. When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽), he was dismayed to hear that the dyke had been destroyed. He {{had no choice but to}} transport his supplies on land, resulting in the wasting of time and effort.|$|E
