5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when chariot racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E

500|$|The 73rd Boat Race {{took place}} on 30 March 1921. [...] Held annually, the Boat Race is a {{side-by-side}} rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Cambridge, with the heavier crew, went into the race as reigning champions, having won the previous year's race. In total, nine of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> year's race had previous Boat Race experience, and five had won a silver medal in the 1920 Summer Olympics. In this year's race, umpired by former rower Frederick I. Pitman, Cambridge won by one length {{in a time of}} 19 minutes 45 seconds. It was Cambridge's third consecutive win, the fastest winning time since 1913 and the narrowest margin of victory since 1913. [...] The result took the overall record to 39–33 in Oxford's favour.|$|E

500|$|The Three Way Ultimate X {{match was}} next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. Petey Williams, Chris Sabin, and Matt Bentley were <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> encounter, which spanned 13 minutes and 13 seconds. Bentley was accompanied by Traci to the ring. In an Ultimate X match, ropes are hung above the ring in a manner to form an [...] "X", in which {{the objective is to}} climb the ropes and retrieve an object {{at the center of the}} [...] "X". In this case, the object was a giant red [...] "X". Sabin scaled the ropes above the ring midway through the match, before Bentley jumped up and tackled him to the mat below. The result of this impact caused the [...] "X" [...] to fall off the ropes. TNA officials then had to re-hang it while the match continued. Later, Bentley and Sabin attempted to retrieve the [...] "X" [...] again, only to cause it to fall once more. This time Williams was standing below and caught it; the referee declared Williams the winner, thus becoming the number-one contender to the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E

2500|$|Another study {{examined}} the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and executive functioning performance through a number of tests. Executive functions are a group of processes that serve to regulate more basic brain functions such as memory, motor skills and attention. Patients who had been exposed prenatally to alcohol show decreased ability to hold and manipulate information in working memory, (the memory system that is used to keep things in mind during complex tasks). [...] Those with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE), (defects caused by a mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy), have poor problem solving skills compared to control participants (participants that do not have either FAS or FAE).

The case report showed that there was a 65. 7 % reduction in wound surface area of the decubitus ulcer at the end of five weeks. Also, bacterial growth reduced from very heavy growth to scanty growth {{at the end of the}} 5 th week.

2500|$|Beginning with a {{plantation}} raid in January and a truck ambush in February, there was steady guerilla ambushes and raids became more regular in 1958, and of serious {{concern to the}} GVN. [...] This intensity level was consistent with Mao's Phase I, [...] "the period of the enemy's strategic offensive and our strategic defensive." [...] Mao's use of [...] "strategic defensive" [...] refers to the guerilla force making its presence known and building its organization, but not attempting to engage military units. [...] George Carver, the principal CIA analyst on Vietnam, said in a Foreign Affairs article, A pattern of politically motivated terror began to emerge, directed against {{the representatives of the}} Saigon government and concentrated on the very bad and the very good. The former were liquidated to win favor with the peasantry; the latter because their effectiveness was a bar to the achievement of Communist objectives. The terror was directed not only against officials but against all whose operations were essential to the functioning of organized political society, school teachers, health workers, agricultural officials, etc. The scale and scope of this terrorist and insurrectionary activity mounted slowly and steadily.

A coordinated command structure was formed by Communists in the Mekong Delta where 37 armed companies were being organized in June 1958. North Vietnam invaded Laos and occupied parts of the country.
