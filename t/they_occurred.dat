5|$|During the Civil War Centennial, the U.S. Post Office issued five {{postage stamps}} commemorating the 100th anniversaries of famous battles, as <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> over a {{four-year}} period, {{beginning with the}} Battle of Fort Sumter Centennial issue of 1961. The Battle of Shiloh commemorative stamp was issued in 1962, the Battle of Gettysburg in 1963, the Battle of the Wilderness in 1964, and the Appomattox Centennial commemorative stamp in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{were not}} held {{on a regular}} schedule; <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> usually every five to six years, upon Emperor's decree. Thus the deputies' term of office lasted about six years. The Diet had ten elections: 1861, 1867, 1870, 1877, 1883, 1889, 1889, 1895, 1901, 1908, and the final one, in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquakes}} were {{a series}} of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. <b>They</b> <b>occurred</b> just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> {{from the}} Eastern Cape to Limpopo. In Swaziland it {{is present in}} the western uplands, and in the Lebombo regions. <b>They</b> <b>occur</b> in coastal, scarp and mistbelt forests, rock outcrops, escarpments, {{riparian}} fringes, or in woodland.|$|R

50|$|A deep-focus {{earthquake}} in seismology is an earthquake with a hypocenter depth exceeding 300 km. <b>They</b> <b>occur</b> almost exclusively at oceanic-continental convergent boundaries {{in association with}} subducted oceanic lithosphere. <b>They</b> <b>occur</b> along a dipping tabular zone beneath the subduction zone known as the Wadati-Benioff zone.|$|R
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|The video debuted on 1 August 2005. It was {{nominated}} at the 15th annual Music Video Production Association Awards {{in the category}} of Adult Contemporary. After its release, the music video was repurposed as a tribute to the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, although it was filmed before <b>they</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which <b>they</b> <b>occurred.</b> The {{credit for the}} first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as <b>they</b> <b>occurred.</b> Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when <b>they</b> <b>occurred.</b> Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch the navigation lights off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|E
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as <b>they</b> <b>occurred,</b> she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E

5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage was}} done on the lakes. Major shipwrecks occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated that the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{river and}} its {{drainage}} basin experienced {{some of the}} world's greatest known catastrophic floods {{toward the end of}} the last ice age. The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods, with discharges exceeding the combined flow of all the other rivers in the world, dozens of times over thousands of years. The exact number of floods is unknown, but geologists have documented at least 40; evidence suggests that <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> between about 19,000 and 13,000years ago.|$|E
25|$|Monotropoids {{occur in}} {{coniferous}} or mixed coniferous forests, often {{in areas with}} a heavy, closed overstory with low light availability. <b>They</b> <b>occur</b> in boggy areas, in deep humusy soils, and even relatively dry slopes. The soil pH in locations in which <b>they</b> <b>occur</b> is acidic to varying degrees.|$|R

5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if <b>they</b> <b>occurred</b> in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{value of}} the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must {{have been based on}} solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an ideal world rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as <b>they</b> <b>occurred,</b> though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.|$|E
