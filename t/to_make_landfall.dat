25|$|Christian {{responded with}} an amphibious {{campaign}} in 1628, using his fleet <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfalls</b> along the occupied coastlines, and destroying the naval facilities in Ålborg, Wismar, and Greifswald. Wallenstein, who had nevertheless managed to build thirteen vessels in Wismar under Philipp von Mansfeld, {{was unable to}} use them, because Swedish ships were blockading that port. Christian IV concluded an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in April, and both supported Stralsund in her successful resistance against Wallenstein. In August, an attempt to secure another bridgehead on the southern Baltic shore failed with Christian IV's defeat in the Battle of Wolgast. After this battle, the final one in the Kejserkrigen, Christian IV was ready to negotiateand so was Wallenstein, whom the Scandinavian alliance seriously threatened.|$|R

5|$|Cyclone Jokwe of March 2008 was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> in Mozambique since Cyclone Favio struck in the previous year, and was the most recent cyclone <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> on Mazambique until Cyclone Dineo in 2017. The tenth named storm of the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Jokwe was first classified as a tropical depression on March 2 over the open Southwest Indian Ocean. It tracked west-southwest, crossing northern Madagascar as a tropical storm on March 5 before intensifying into a tropical cyclone on March 6. Jokwe rapidly intensified to reach peak winds of 195km/h (120mph), before weakening slightly and striking Nampula Province in northeastern Mozambique. It quickly weakened while paralleling the coastline, though the storm restrengthened as it turned southward in the Mozambique Channel. Late in its duration, it remained nearly stationary for several days, and steadily weakened due to wind shear before dissipating on March 16.|$|E
5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since Hurricane Andrew on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina was an {{extremely}} destructive Category 5 hurricane that affected {{the majority of the}} Gulf Coast. Its damaging trek began on August 23, 2005 when it originated as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas.

2500|$|The Duchy of Pomerania, which {{included}} Wolgast, capitulated to the Empire at Franzburg in November 1627. The Baltic Sea, however, remained under Danish control, {{due to the}} lack of an imperial navy. The Emperor Ferdinand II gave Wallenstein the Duchy of Mecklenburg in January, and promoted him [...] "General of the Oceanic and Baltic Seas" [...] in April 1628. Together with Spain, Wallenstein made plans for a Baltic imperial navy. Denmark and Sweden reacted by concluding an alliance, also in April. The Pomeranian port of Stralsund, some 70 kilometers west of Wolgast, refused to accept the Capitulation of Franzburg and with Danish and Swedish support successfully resisted Wallenstein's siege. In addition to the support for Stralsund, Christian IV had resorted to a strategy of amphibious ambushes, using his naval superiority <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfalls</b> on Fehmarn and in Eckernförde, and destroying the naval facilities in Ålborg, Greifswald and Wismar - all in imperial hands.|$|R
25|$|Germany {{launched}} their invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, {{and despite the}} efforts of the Norwegians and the British, the Germans controlled most of the country by the beginning of May.

5|$|Hurricane Rick was the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit {{almost a month}} after the more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters {{believed}} Alex {{would remain}} weak, {{and on the}} first advisory the storm was predicted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> as a minimal tropical storm. However, when strengthening became evident, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet about 20hours before hurricane conditions were experienced. In addition, a tropical storm warning existed {{for much of the}} North Carolina coastline as Alex paralleled the state.|$|E
5|$|On May12, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued {{warnings}} for the Tokyo area as Rammasun was forecast <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> {{near the}} city. As Rammasun became extratropical, the storm brushed the Japanese coastline on May13, producing winds gusting up to 85km/h (50mph) and high waves for several hours. An estimated 10hectares (24.7acres) of farmland were damaged. Damage {{from the storm}} amounted to ¥770million ($8.4million 2008 USD) in agricultural losses.|$|E
50|$|Hurricane Alma was {{the first}} of three {{consecutive}} storms to come close <b>to,</b> or <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. At least three, and possibly twenty, people were killed. Three were killed when a house near Lázaro Cárdenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in the state of Puebla caused by Alma's rains. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with debris throughout the affected area.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of {{where and when}} typhoons (or named hurricanes which form over the North Atlantic Ocean) will <b>make</b> <b>landfall</b> is critical <b>to</b> protecting human lives and properties. Although the traditional method of typhoon track prediction based on the steering flow theory has been proven {{to be an effective}} way in most situations, it slipped up in some cases. Our analysis of the long-term Chinese typhoon records reveals that typhoons, especially super typhoons (those with maximum sustained surface winds of greater than 51 ms(- 1)), have a trend <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>landfalls</b> toward warmer land in China over the past 50 years (1960 - 2009). Numerical sensitivity experiments using an advanced atmospheric model further confirm this finding. Our finding suggests an alternative approach to predict the landfall tracks of the most devastating typhoons in the southeastern China.
