40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Small {{businesses}} {{are essential for}} stimulating growth and alleviating poverty. The main {{aim of this study}} is to gather information regarding obstacles that withhold <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> from further development. This implies that attention will be given to the role of the entrepreneur, <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> and <b>the</b> role that <b>business</b> planning plays, in order to identify, minimise and possibly overcome the identified obstacles. Although small business is not an absolute distinctly defined sector, it has a particular role to play in the sustainability of the economy. Whatever the past, present or future economical position and function of <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector,</b> it is clear that entrepreneurship is one of the biggest driving forces in this sector. The contribution of <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> to <b>the</b> economy in terms of employment is of crucial importance (Timmons & Spinelli, 200454). Researchers agree that the establishment of small <b>business</b> in <b>the</b> community provides job creation and further contributes to the stimulation of the economy. Against the background of the relevant literature regarding the role that entrepreneurship plays in the development of <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> research questions driving this study were: What are the major obstacles towards entering <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> in <b>the</b> Emfuleni district? What initiatives should be followed to develop <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> in <b>the</b> Emfuleni district? A literature study in entrepreneurship, small business development, and business planning, pointed to a number of obstacles that are experienced during the start-up of a small <b>business.</b> <b>The</b> current situation pertaining to entrepreneurship indicates that training within this field would be beneficial. With a proactive entrepreneurial perspective, and the necessary government support, <b>the</b> small <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> will contribute to the sustainability of the economy in the Emfuleni district.

This study described the state of <b>the</b> informal <b>business</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> contributions thereof in local economic development, and the level of responsiveness from local authorities in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. A survey questionnaire was administered to informal business actors in BCMM and semi-structured interviews were conducted with BCMM managers in <b>the</b> <b>Business</b> Development and Local Economic Development Directorates who were purposively selected because of the positions that they hold in the municipality. This study found that <b>the</b> informal <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> is underdeveloped in BCMM, and is imbued with development challenges, namely; support services such as infrastructure (designated municipal trading stalls) and access to financial support and the lack of strategy/policy dedicated to the prioritisation of the needs of <b>the</b> informal <b>business</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> informal <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> in BCMM is dominated by small and micro <b>businesses.</b> <b>The</b> municipality acknowledges the contributions of <b>the</b> informal <b>business</b> <b>sector</b> in local economic development from a job creation (selfemployment) and poverty alleviation perspective.
