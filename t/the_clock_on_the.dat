5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were working around <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is mainly 14thcentury although the east {{wall of the}} chancel contains remnants of 12th-century material, including two clamped buttresses. The ashlar-faced tower is 14thcentury with angled buttresses north and south. The west window has three lights with flowing tracery. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east face of the tower, dated 1876, is by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire, the oldest firm of tower clockmakers in the world; it is wound weekly by the churchwardens.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{connected}} to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in {{the centre of the}} building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E

25|$|The Saints {{beat the}} Eagles 26–24 in the Saturday night game. It was the Saints' first ever road playoff victory. The Saints built an early 20–7 lead before the Eagles bounced {{back to take}} a 24–23 lead with {{less than five minutes}} {{remaining}} in the game. However, the Saints worked their way down the field while also working <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's final drive before Shayne Graham kicked the game-winning field goal from 32 yards out as time expired.|$|E
25|$|Steve Young came in {{to replace}} Montana on the next drive, and the 49ers tried to run {{as much time as}} they could off <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second play off the drive Brent Jones got behind the Giants defense and Young hit him for a twenty-five-yard gain. Two plays later, Craig {{recorded}} a six-yard gain for the 49ers' first rushing first down of the day. On the very next play Erik Howard poked the ball out of Craig's arms as he hit the line and Taylor caught it out of the air, giving the Giants possession on the first turnover of the game.|$|E
25|$|Notre Dame won a {{turnover}} filled game, 13–6. After a scoreless first quarter, Notre Dame {{opened the}} scoring with a 33-yard field goal from Kyle Brindza {{and added to}} its lead before halftime via a two-yard touchdown run from Tommy Rees. Notre Dame led 10–0 at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, Michigan scored its first points of the game via a 33-yard field goal from Brendan Gibbons. Notre Dame responded with a 39-yard field goal from Kyle Brindza, but Michigan added another field goal—a 31-yard kick from Gibbons—to cut the lead to seven. Notre Dame was able to run out <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ensuing drive, ending the game and ending a three-game losing streak to Michigan.|$|E

25|$|The match {{began with}} a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was {{seemingly}} {{the result of a}} defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to be after the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoreboard runs out.|$|E
25|$|For a {{brief period}} in the late 19th century, Yecapixtla {{experienced}} a surge in economic development when a railway was built through connecting it to Mexico City through {{what is now the}} eastern panhandle of the State of Mexico. Electricity and telephone were introduced. During this time Evaristo Navo was the head clergyman in the area and is credited with a number of developments including a parish school, the installation of a church organ, with accompanying encouragement of musical training. He also installed <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> San Juan Bautista Church. One purpose of the parish school was to preserve and in some cases restitute old traditions which had been lost due to the Liberal reforms of the latter 19th century. The school closed in 1911. Further attempts to keep older traditions alive were headed by Juventino Pineda Enriquez who created the “Misiones Culturales” (Cultural Missions).|$|E
25|$|This {{uncommon}} modern formation {{focuses on}} ball possession in the midfield. In fact, {{it is very}} rare {{to see it as}} an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or tie score. Its more common variants are 3–4–2–1 or 3–4–3 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on playing the ball back towards the own goal to assist with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, when the team is losing, {{at least one of the}} playmakers will more frequently play in the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. Guus Hiddink is one of the few coaches who has used this formation, recently for Australia during the 2006 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the second}} quarter commenced, both Brown and Gresham moved the ball for a {{touchdown}} on three different plays. Tech started their next drive at their own 38 and advanced the ball through the air to eventually get to the Oklahoma 15. Two incompletions caused the Red Raiders to face a 4th-and-3. Tech {{decided to go for}} it. Woods was unable to catch a pass by Harrell to convert and Tech turned the ball over on downs. Murray rushed the ball for 23yards on Oklahoma's first play of the drive. Murray followed with a 31-yard reception, which put the ball on the Tech 30. After two rushes by Brown, Gresham scored a touchdown on a 19-yard catch, and the subsequent extra point extended the Sooners lead to 21–0. Oklahoma's defense forced Tech to four plays on the next drive, with the fourth play being a 4th-and-4, Tech's second 4th down conversion attempt. With 9:31 remaining, Oklahoma completed a 1:44 scoring drive, which was capped by Juaquin Iglesias' 28-yard scoring reception. On the following possession, the Red Raiders reached the end zone, thanks to Harrell's 25-yard throw to Tramain Swindall. Matt Williams' extra point brought the score to 28–7. With 6:28 left in the half, Oklahoma began to drain the clock using their running game. The Sooners eventually scored on the 12th play of the drive. Once Tech got the ball, about a minute was left on <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second play, Harrell threw an interception to Travis Lewis, who returned the ball 47yards. Tech offensive guard Brandon Carter, who stopped Lewis at the Tech 1, received a personal foul. Murray scored on a 1-yard rush to increase the Sooners' lead to 42–7. Tech got the ball again after the Sooner touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Harrell threw a shovel pass to Baron Batch, who ran 21 yards to the Tech 28. The half ended with Tech receiving a 16-yard personal foul. The Red Raiders left the field facing their biggest deficit of the season (35 points).|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} considered models {{by several}} sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the [...] "most agreeable to Mrs. Logan." [...] She admired {{not only the}} posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments {{in the city that}} featured granite bases. [...] Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the reliefs to be found on the statue base. [...] Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government. [...] Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work. [...] He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896.

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins.
