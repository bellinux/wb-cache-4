25|$|The {{purpose of}} a DAO action in a {{semi-automatic}} is mostly to avoid the change in trigger pull {{between the first and}} subsequent shots that one experiences in a DA/SA pistol, while avoiding the perceived danger of carrying a cocked single-action handgun, although it also avoids having to carry a cocked and loaded pistol, or having to lower the hammer on a loaded chamber, if one only fires a partial magazine. A good example of this action in a semi-automatic is the SIG Sauer DAK trigger, or the DAO action of the Sig P250. For striker-fired pistols such as the Taurus 24/7, the striker will remain in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> through the entire reloading cycle. This term applies most often to semi-automatic handguns; however, the term can also apply to some revolvers such as the Smith & Wesson Centennial, the Type 26 Revolver, and the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolvers, {{in which there is no}} external hammer spur, or which simply lack the internal sear mechanism capable of holding the hammer in the cocked position.|$|E

40|$|Cerebral palsy {{are found}} {{as a result}} of these disorders, along with {{associated}} neuromuscular functional alterations that affect <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> head. In this context, <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> head could be responsible for several skeletal and dental occlusal disorders among patients with cerebral palsy. Objective: To assess the presence of malocclusions in patients with cerebral palsy, define the most frequent types of malocclusions, and evaluate how <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> head may be implicated in the development of such malocclusions. Study design: Forty-four patients aged between 12 - 55 years (18 males and 26 females) were studied. Occlusal conditions, the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI), changes in <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> head, and breathing and swallowing functions were assessed. Results: Orthodontic treatment was required by 70. 8 % of the patients, the most frequent malocclusions being molar class II, open bite and high overjet. These individuals showed altered breathing and swallowing functions, as well as habit and postural disorders. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> head, especially the hyperextended presentation, was significantly correlated to high DAI scores. Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that patients with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to present malocclusions, particularly molar class II malocclusion, increased open bite, and high overjet. Such alterations in turn are more common in patients with a hyperextended position of the head...|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{wire stripper}} was first patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism to return to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position.</b> The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before {{any other part of}} the mechanism began to return to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|E

50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the adjusting lever rocks enough to advance the adjuster gear by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|E
5000|$|To create catenanes, the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) {{can be used}} as a {{template}} to [...] "thread" [...] a crown ether with a π-donor component. Subsequently, its still open ends are linked with each other to obtain two closed rings. A bistable catenane (a ring with two π-donor components) is already a simple example of a molecular switch. In the present example, a cyclic ether has been selected with a TTF and a DNP moiety. While the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) surroundings the TTF unit in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position,</b> the DNP unit is stable when the TTF is (reversible) is oxidized. The ring rotates in this case due to the coulomb repulsion around itself until the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) encloses the DNP unit. A reverse movement occurs when the TTF unit is reduced again. This first example that proved the general feasibility, many more have followed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of low-frequency TENS (LFT) and high-frequency TENS (HFT) in post-episiotomy pain relief. Method: A randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial with placebo composed of 33 puerperae with post-episiotomy pain. TENS was applied for 30 minutes to groups: HFT(100 Hz; 100 &# 181;s), LFT (5 Hz; 100 &# 181;s), and placebo (PT). Four electrodes were placed in parallel near the episiotomy and four pain evaluations were performed with the numeric rating scale. The first and the second evaluation took place before TENS application and immediately after its removal and were done in <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> and in <b>the</b> activities of sitting and ambulating. The third and fourth evaluation took place 30 and 60 minutes after TENS removal, only in <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position.</b> Intragroup differences were verified using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests, and the intergroup analysis employed the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: In the intragroup analysis, {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>the</b> PT during <b>rest,</b> sitting, and ambulation (P> 0. 05). In the HFT and LFT, a significant difference was observed in all activities (P< 0. 001).

50|$|SIG {{released}} an altered {{version of the}} double-action only (DAO) pistols called the DAK (for Double Action Kellermann, after the designer of the trigger system, Harald Kellermann of Eckernförde, Germany). The DAK capability is available in 220, 226, 229 and 239 models. When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is 29 N (compared to 44 N for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward, the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position.</b> The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 38 N. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 29 N. To engage the intermediate reset, the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired. The pistol can be cocked by pulling the trigger just past the trigger reset, then stopping, then releasing.|$|E

5000|$|From {{his famous}} 1896 Lectures on Gas Theory, Boltzmann {{diagrams}} {{the structure of}} a solid body, as shown above, by postulating that each molecule in the body has a [...] "rest position". According to Boltzmann, if it approaches a neighbor molecule it is repelled by it, but if it moves farther away there is an attraction. This, of course was a revolutionary perspective in its time; many, during these years, did not believe in the existence of either atoms or molecules (see: history of the molecule). [...] According to these early views, and others such as those developed by William Thomson, if energy in the form of heat is added to a solid, so to make it into a liquid or a gas, a common depiction is that the ordering of the atoms and molecules becomes more random and chaotic with an increase in temperature:Thus, according to Boltzmann, owing to increases in thermal motion, whenever heat is added to a working substance, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> of molecules will be pushed apart, the body will expand, and this will create more molar-disordered distributions and arrangements of molecules.

Subjects and methods: Subjects were 28 healthy adults (12 men, 16 women; mean age, 39. 75 ± 9. 50 years) without any history or present complaints of swallowing disorders. We first established the participant’s posture a reclining wheelchair that was adjusted to a 30 -degree angle with the headrest (without excessive neck muscle tone) or without headrest (with excessive neck muscle tone), used an electromyogram above the mylohyoid muscle to represent the suprahyoid muscles and above the sternohyoid muscle to represent the infrahyoid muscles to confirm neck muscle tone, and then conducted VF of swallowing measurements. Videofluorographic images were obtained when 5 mL of 50 % (w/v) barium sulfate was being swallowed, and hyoid bone coordinate (<b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> and <b>the</b> elevated position), extent of horizontal and vertical hyoid bone elevation, as well as duration and velocity of hyoid bone elevation were evaluated (x-axis and y-axis coordinates for <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of hyoid bone {{are referred to as}} Xr and Yr, respectively; those for the elevated hyoid bone position induced during swallowing are referred to as Xs and Ys, respectively). Results: In <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of <b>the</b> hyoid bone, the Yr coordinates in those with excessive neck muscle tone were significantly lower than in those without excessive neck muscle tone. Vertical hyoid bone elevation and hyoid bone elevation velocity were significantly higher with excessive neck muscle tone than without excessive neck muscle tone, whereas horizontal elevation showed no significant differences. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the generation of neck muscle tone due to inappropriate posture may encourage hyoid depression and increase the extent of hyoid bone elevation, thereby increasing the risk of aspiration.
