In 1884, with Angel Celli, he first {{observed}} Gram-negative diplococci in the cerebrospinal fluid of a fatal case of meningitis in 1884.

The results from their study showed a strong positive relationship between leisure satisfaction and the patients' met needs. The results basically state that the more leisure patients experienced, the more likely they felt their social, education and psychological needs were met. The study concluded that leisure is as important for people with psychiatric disabilities as it is for the general public. As Lloyd, King, Lampe, & McDougall (2001) explained, the general public may view an event, such as a leisure activity, as unsatisfactory, but to a mental patient a leisure activity can greatly raise their average happiness. Prvu, J. (1999) conducted a study among brain injury patients. Results showed that patients involved in the leisure activity program that helped increase leisure skills and knowledge of community resources also provided patients with an increase in self-confidence and leisure participation, which in turn increased leisure satisfaction. Leisure activity can be a significant factor in lowering a person's level of depressive symptoms.|$|R

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) ensures correct separation of sister chromatids in somatic cells and provokes a cell cycle arrest in metaphase if one chromatid is not correctly {{attached to the}} bipolar spindle. Prolonged metaphase arrest due to overexpression of Mad 2 {{has been shown to}} be deleterious to the ensuing anaphase, leading to the generation of aneuploidies and tumorigenesis. Additionally, some SAC components are essential for correct timing of prometaphase. In meiosis, we and others have shown previously that the Mad 2 -dependent SAC is functional during the first meiotic division in mouse oocytes. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Mad 2 interferes with the SAC in metaphase I, and a knock-down approach using RNA interference accelerates anaphase onset in meiosis I. <b>To</b> <b>prove</b> unambigiously <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of SAC control for mammalian female meiosis I we analyzed oocyte maturation in Mad 2 heterozygote mice, and in oocytes overexpressing a GFP-tagged version of Mad 2.

Furthermore, SAC control is impaired in mad 2 +/- oocytes, also leading to the generation of aneuploidies in meiosis I...|$|R

Minimally invasive knee prosthetic surgery, with only a compartment replacement (unicompartmental knee replacement), {{might be a good}} compromise between osteotomy and total knee prosthesis. The focus {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a protocol to assess the fixation method of the femoral components in mechanical simulation, for pre-clinical validation; the wear behaviour of two different fixation frames was quantified and compared. In particular, two different wear tests were conducted using the same knee simulator, the same load profiles and the same kinematics; two different fixation methods were applied to the femoral sleds (synthetic femur and metal block). Surface characterization on both articulating bearings was performed by a roughness measuring machine and coordinate measuring machine. The wear produced by the tibial inserts using the synthetic femur was considerably higher than the wear registered by the metal-block holder. Roughness measurements on femoral sleds showed a limited number of scratches with high Rt values for the metal-block set-up; the damaged surface broadened in the case of femoral condyles and tibial inserts mounted on composite bone, but lower Rt and linear penetration values were measured. The two holding frames showed different wear activities as a consequence of dissimilar dynamic performance.

40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) encodes ORF 57, which {{enhances the}} expression of intronless KSHV genes on multiple posttranscriptional levels. However, it remains elusive how ORF 57 recognizes viral RNAs. Here, we demonstrate that ORF 57 also increases {{the expression of}} the multiple intron-containing K 15 gene. The nucleotide bias of the K 15 cDNA revealed an unusual high AT content. Thus, we optimized the K 15 cDNA by raising the frequency of GC nucleotides, yielding an ORF 57 -independent version. <b>To</b> further <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of <b>the</b> sequence bias of ORF 57 -dependent RNAs, we grouped KSHV mR-NAs according to their AT content and found a correlation between AT-richness and ORF 57 dependency. More importantly, latent genes, which have to be expressed in the absence of ORF 57, have a low AT content and are indeed ORF 57 independent. The nucleotide composition of K 15 resembles that of HIV gag, which cannot be expressed unless RNA export is facilitated by the HIV Rev protein. Interestingly, ORF 57 can partially rescue HIV Gag expression. Thus, the KSHV target RNAs of ORF 57 and HIV gag RNA may share certain motifs based on the nucleotide bias. A bioinformatic comparison between wild-type and sequence-optimized K 15 revealed a higher density for hnRNP-binding motifs in the former. We speculate that binding of particular hn-RNPs to KSHV lytic transcripts is the prerequisite for ORF 57 to enhance their expression. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> <b>The</b> mostly intronless genes of KSHV are only expressed {{in the presence of the}} viral regulator protein ORF 57, but how ORF 5...|$|R
40|$|WT 1, a {{critical}} regulator of kidney development, is a tumor suppressor for nephroblastoma {{but in some}} contexts functions as an oncogene. A limited number of direct transcriptional targets of WT 1 have been identified to explain its complex roles in tumorigenesis and organogenesis. In this study we performed genome-wide screening for direct WT 1 targets, {{using a combination of}} ChIP–ChIP and expression arrays. Promoter regions bound by WT 1 were highly G-rich and resembled the sites for a number of other widely expressed transcription factors such as SP 1, MAZ, and ZNF 219. Genes directly regulated by WT 1 were implicated in MAPK signaling, axon guidance, and Wnt pathways. Among directly bound and regulated genes by WT 1, nine were identified in the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting that WT 1 modulates a subset of Wnt components and responsive genes by direct binding. <b>To</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> biological <b>importance</b> of <b>the</b> interplay between WT 1 and Wnt signaling, we showed that WT 1 blocked the ability of Wnt 8 to induce a secondary body axis during Xenopus embryonic development. WT 1 inhibited TCF-mediated transcription activated by Wnt ligand, wild type and mutant, stabilized β-catenin by preventing TCF 4 loading onto a promoter. This was neither due to direct binding of WT 1 to the TCF binding site nor to interaction between WT 1 and TCF 4, but by competition of WT 1 and TCF 4 for CBP.
