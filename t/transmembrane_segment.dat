D54 and D55 interact electrostatically with R237 in the S4 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor, helping to stabilize S4 in the activated state, which in turn locks open the channel unless the cell is held at a strongly hyperpolarizing (negative) membrane potential.

The 10 TMS proteins appear to have two extra TMSs between the two 4 TMS repeat units. Like the ABC exporters, {{it is possible that the}} integral membrane proteins of ABC uptake systems also evolved at least 3 times independently, based on their high resolution 3-dimensional structures.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} subfamily of membrane proteins are the transmembrane α-helical proteins, {{in which}} the membrane-spanning regions {{are made up of}} α-helices. Given the obvious biological and medical significance of these proteins, it is of tremendous practical importance to identify the location of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments.</b> The difficulty of inferring the secondary or tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins using experimental techniques has led to a surge of interest in applying techniques from machine learning and bioinformatics to infer secondary structure from primary structure in these proteins. We are therefore interested in determining which physicochemical properties are most useful for discriminating <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane <b>segments</b> in <b>transmembrane</b> proteins, and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured <b>segments</b> in <b>transmembrane</b> proteins, and in using the results of these investigations to develop classifiers to identify <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments</b> in <b>transmembrane</b> proteins. Results We determined that the most useful properties for discriminating <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane segments and for discriminating intrinsically unstructured segments from intrinsically structured <b>segments</b> in <b>transmembrane</b> proteins were hydropathy, polarity, and flexibility, and used the results of this analysis to construct classifiers to discriminate <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments</b> from non-transmembrane segments using four classification techniques: two variants of the Self-Organizing Global Ranking algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, and a support vector machine algorithm. All four techniques exhibited good performance, with out-of-sample accuracies of approximately 75 %. Conclusions Several interesting observations emerged from our study: intrinsically unstructured <b>segments</b> and <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments</b> tend to have opposite properties; transmembrane proteins appear to be much richer in intrinsically unstructured segments than other proteins; and, in approximately 70 % of transmembrane proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured segments, the intrinsically unstructured segments are close to <b>transmembrane</b> <b>segments.</b> </p...|$|R
