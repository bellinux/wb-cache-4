5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and emerged into the Pacific, where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was moving slowly northward due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of a large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E

Chisholm graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1931 and as Doctor of Music in 1934.
