5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{campaigned for}} state {{government}} programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed {{affirmative action and}} same-sex marriage. David Brooks opined that Corzine was so liberal that his election, although {{the fact that his}} predecessor was also a Democrat, helped push <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> the left.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E

5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest. Consistent with {{his support of}} Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson. In 1833, Clay proposed a compromise in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> quell the Nullification Crisis; Letcher introduced Clay's compromise in the House.|$|E
5|$|Burton was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. Burton and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. Burton also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{actions as}} emperor were {{described}} as being especially harsh to <b>the</b> <b>senate,</b> <b>to</b> the nobility and to the equestrian order. According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula. Eventually, officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea succeeded in murdering the emperor. The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} been informed of it and involved in it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> {{was headed}} by the Governor-General of Finland. The members of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> had <b>to</b> be Finnish citizens. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> was divided into the {{economic}} division and the judicial division. In 1822 both divisions were given a Finnish vice-chairman. From 1858 and onwards the members of <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> were formally known as senators. After the February Revolution in Russia the Vice Chairman of the Economic Division became the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Civil War in 1918 <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town of Vaasa from January 29 to May 3.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>senate</b> was <b>to</b> {{supervise}} <b>the</b> {{chamber of}} deputies, ensuring it acts {{according to the}} constitution, and ensure the proper procedure during <b>the</b> elections. <b>The</b> <b>senate</b> could object <b>to</b> a legislation, but could be overruled by the king.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.|$|E
5|$|Each Senator has {{at least}} one {{standing}} committee assignment. The first is to one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings. A number of Senators have secondary committee assignments, most prominently to the Executive Nominations Committee, which oversees the constitutional responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> approve nominations by the Governor. Assignment to the Rules or Executive Nominations committees or to any Ad Hoc committees is not noted.|$|E
50|$|Governor Dewey {{appointed}} Dulles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> vacancy {{caused by}} the resignation of Democrat Robert F. Wagner.

In 1995, Hatfield was the only Republican in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> vote against the proposed balanced budget amendment, and was the deciding vote that prevented {{the passage of the}} bill. In 1996 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a group he served on previously, granted him their Distinguished Service Award.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering {{the powers of the}} head of state; both pressured <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the UN's goal of {{reducing}} the number of hungry people in the world by half by 2015, Ambassador McGovern formulated detailed plans, urging delivery of more surplus food to foreign school-lunch programs and the establishment of specific targets such as had been done in old American programs. He began working again with fellow former Senator Bob Dole to convince <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> support this effort, as well as expanded school lunch, food stamps, and nutritional help for pregnant women and poor children in the U.S.|$|E

In light of Sulla's recent election as consul, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> appointed him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> command, and Marius, now nearing seventy, was furious. He appealed to the mob, which turned out in his support and eventually marched on <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> threatening <b>to</b> kill Sulla.|$|R
5|$|In the Philippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts {{of three}} scenes {{depicting}} sexual intercourse and female nudity before the movie could {{be shown in}} theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> demand {{the abolition of the}} censorship board. President Fidel V. Ramos himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the debates}} {{leading up to}} World War I, a number of isolationist {{senators}} filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, {{the small group of}} senators continued to lock up <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>to</b> prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of all Senators, not only the ones voting.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E

Although he had no mandate from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> authorize such a move, he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, Jefferson removed 146 of 316 (46%) incumbent, second-level, {{appointed}} federal officials, including 13 U.S. Attorneys and 18 U.S. Marshals. Jefferson also displaced two district judgesRay Greene and Jacob Readciting technical {{flaws in}} their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and {{removed from office}} on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, but six Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> prevent his conviction by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, established by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>to</b> deal with particular issues. This may occur when {{a particular group}} of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E
