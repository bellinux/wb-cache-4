5000|$|The family's current name <b>Thylacomyidae</b> {{is derived}} from an invalid synonym Thylacomys, meaning ‘pouched mouse’, from the Ancient Greek [...] ( [...] , ‘pouch, sack’) and [...] ( [...] , ‘mouse, muscle’), {{sometimes}} misspelt Thalacomys.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{molecular}} analyses {{have resulted}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction of the members of Peramelemorphia with quite strong support. The most basal split separates <b>Thylacomyidae</b> (Macrotis) from all other bandicoots. Probably the next to diverge was the recently extinct Chaeropodidae (Chaeropus). The remaining taxa comprise the Peramelidae, which divides into subfamilies Peramelinae (Isoodon and Perameles) and a clade in which the Echymiperinae (Echymipera and Microperoryctes) form a sister group to Peroryctinae (Peroryctes): ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{specimens}} of modern peramelemorphian (e.g. Perameles spp. and Isoodon spp.) {{have been recovered}} in the fossil record from Pleistocene and Holocene fossil localities. However, very few fossil species have been recovered to date. The first species of fossil peramelemorphian was described by R. A. Stirton in 1955. The specimen Stirton described was a partial lower jaw from the Tirari Desert in Central Australia, Pliocene in age. The lower jaw morphology suggested a relationship with bilbies (Family <b>Thylacomyidae),</b> and was named Ischnodon australis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} year, Richard Owen read a paper {{before the}} Zoological Society of London, {{in which he}} proposed to erect a new genus for this species, named Thylacomys. This name was widely adopted and remained in use for many years. Thus it was that when B. Arthur Bensley erected a subfamily to hold the genus in 1903, he named it Thylacomyinae. [...] This name remains valid, and has since been promoted to family rank as <b>Thylacomyidae,</b> but Thylacomys itself is no longer considered valid, as Reid's original paper is held to have established the generic name Macrotis. Thus the currently accepted scientific name for the species is Macrotis lagotis.|$|E
40|$|Bandicoots and bilbies (Peramelemorphia) {{represent}} a distinct lineage within the marsupial adaptive radiation, which despite several curious anatomical traits has received little morphological attention. Many bandicoot species (family Peramelidae) dig for subterranean food, while bilbies (family <b>Thylacomyidae)</b> employ their forelimbs to dig extensive burrow systems for shelter. In the current study, dissections {{of the southern}} brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) (n≤ 7) and greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) (n≤ 4) provide the first anatomical descriptions of forelimb musculature in these species. The anatomical arrangement of forelimb muscles in I. obesulus and M. lagotis {{differs from that of}} other marsupials and corresponds to the aclaviculate pectoral girdle and modified arrangement of digits in the study species. Comparative and functional interpretations indicate that the forelimb of I. obesulus is well equipped for scratch digging and demonstrates muscular modifications in order to generate large out-forces. The bones of the forelimb, and in particular the antebrachium, are relatively short, stout bones, improving both their resistance to mechanical forces and providing a mechanical advantage via a reduced out-lever length. There has been an increase in the absolute volume of muscles employed during digging, thereby increasing the magnitude of the in-force. Increased in-lever lengths have been achieved via the migration of muscle insertions, including the elongate olecranon for the insertion of the m. triceps brachii, and the distal migration of the humeral attachments of the teres major, latissimus dorsi and superficial pectoral muscles...|$|E
