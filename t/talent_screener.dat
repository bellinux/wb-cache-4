40|$|The {{system of}} {{promotion}} and relegation in sports {{is most often}} associated with team leagues in Europe. Mechanisms by which teams are promoted are generally not examined since {{the length of the}} season and the nature of play in a team sports league make it clear which are the best performing teams. Thus, <b>screening</b> <b>talent</b> has been a fairly simple process in a team sports league. Although the dynamics of promoting an athlete to a major individual sports league is not entirely different, an individual’s talent can be assessed through mechanisms that offer more or less observations. This paper examines the ability of two PGA TOUR promotion mechanisms— the Nationwide Tour and Qualifying School—to predict success. Thus, assessment mechanisms with either many or few observations can be used to <b>screen</b> <b>talent.</b> As expected, the results suggest that more observations from the Nationwide Tour assessment mechanism provide more information about talent {{that can be used to}} better predict success on the PGA TOUR...|$|R

Still, Teen Beach 2 lacks a bit of the charm exhibited in the first movie, although that will not matter much to fans of the original." ...|$|R
