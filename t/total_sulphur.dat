The quality of this gas, although adequate {{for use in the}} power station, was not suitable for delivery to the National Transmission System (NTS). Because of the high nitrogen content (8-11 mol %) the Wobbe number was too low (45.9-48.1 MJ/m3) and the <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> content (35 ppm) was too high. A gas treatment plant with a capacity of 200 MMSCFD (for times when the power station operated at reduced capacity) was constructed at Connah's Quay to treat the gas to a quality suitable for delivery to the NTS.The plant was owned and operated by PowerGen (now E.ON UK) and started up in November 1997, the plant was built by Costain's, the capital cost of the project was £40 million.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: During coal {{processing}} such as pyrolysis, liquefaction, gasification and combustion, significant {{quantities of}} toxic trace-metals and sulphur can be {{released into the}} atmosphere causing severe environmental problems (water, air & soil pollution). Some of these contaminants are corrosive in nature and can cause damages to the combustion reactors which might lead to {{the reduction of the}} reactor life span. Additionally, other elements in coal might be trapped inside the combustion boilers and cause slagging, abrasion and fouling. Coal impurities such as trace-metals and sulphur cannot be controlled or prevented as they occur naturally during coal genesis. Therefore, development of analytical procedures is urgently required for determination of coal impurities for future clean-up strategies. Concentration levels of the elemental contaminants in coal must be monitored and controlled {{in order to determine the}} coal quality and value. The aim of the current study was to develop cost-effective, novel and environmentally friendly sample preparation procedures based on the use of microwave radiation for quantitative extraction of trace-metals and sulphur in coal samples followed by ICP-MS/OES & IC analysis and coal clean-up approaches. Determination of trace-metals and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> was conducted by using two microwave based methods followed by ICP-MS/OES analysis. The first developed sample preparation procedure was microwave-assisted acid extraction (MW-ADAE) using different dilute inorganic acid and their combination with hydrogen peroxide. Optimisation for trace-metals and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> extraction was conducted by using multivariate and univariate approaches, respectively. In both cases (trace-metals and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> optimisation), results indicated that dilute HNO 3 -H 2 O 2 was the suitable mixture for simultaneous extraction of 22 elements and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> in coal samples. The use of dilute nitric acid eliminates the carcinogenic nitrous oxides that are produced by concentrated nitric acid (normally used in classic acid digestion methods) and also reduces laboratory waste generated. The MW-ADAE method was then applied in three South African coals coded as coal sample A, B & C (CSA, CSB & CSC) for determination of trace-metals and <b>total</b> <b>sulphur</b> [...] . Ph. D.
