5|$|On November 6, 1998, President Bill Clinton {{sent the}} first ever presidential email to Glenn aboard <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery.</b> Clinton sent the email from {{the home of a}} friend in Arkansas using a Toshiba Satellite laptop {{computer}} that belonged to White House physician Robert Darling.|$|E
5|$|At Cape Canaveral, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E

25|$|On September 20, 2009, {{the airport}} {{was used as}} a {{refueling}} stop for the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) piggybacking <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> back to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) from Amarillo after STS-128. The short hops between refueling the SCA were due to the heavy payload still inside the orbiter, specifically the Leonardo (ISS module) that carried wastes from the International Space Station. After refueling, the tandem flew to Barksdale Air Force Base, using most of the runway. This was the last flight of a Space Shuttle between Edwards Air Force Base and Kennedy Space Center; all of the remaining landings of the Shuttle were at KSC.|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} fix to a leak in the oxidizer {{system of}} <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery's</b> {{attitude control system}} was proposed by MSFC. This fix involved the passing of a shuttlecock past the leaking Dynaflow fitting and sealing the vent tube containing the fitting with Chemseal 3808 -A 2. The {{question of whether the}} Chemseal 3808 -A 2 can flow into the leak path and provide a better seal was addressed analytically and by experiment to verify the analytical formula used.

25|$|A space {{observatory}} is any instrument, {{such as a}} telescope, {{in outer}} space which is used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects. In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer {{was the first to}} conceive the idea of a telescope in outer space, a decade before the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik into orbit. Spitzer's proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hindered by Earth's atmosphere. After lobbying in the 1960s and 1970s for such a system to be built, Spitzer's vision ultimately materialized into the world's first space-based optical telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched on April 20, 1990 by <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> (STS-31).|$|E
25|$|Ulysses was {{deployed}} into low-Earth orbit from <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery.</b> From there, it was propelled on {{a trajectory}} to Jupiter {{by a combination}} of solid rocket motors. This upper stage consisted of a two-stage Boeing IUS (Inertial Upper Stage), plus a McDonnell Douglas PAM-S (Payload Assist Module-Special). The IUS was inertially stabilised and actively guided during its burn. The PAM-S was unguided and it and Ulysses were spun up to 80 rpm for stability at the start of its burn. On burnout of the PAM-S, the motor and spacecraft stack was yo-yo de-spun (weights deployed at the end of cables) to below 8 rpm prior to separation of the spacecraft. On leaving Earth, the spacecraft became the fastest ever artificially-accelerated object, and held that title until the New Horizons probe was launched.|$|E

[...] He was the pilot for <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> during its August 2009 flight, and has logged over 332 hours in outer space.

50|$|In 1979 the Concorde visited Bergstrom, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttles</b> Columbia and <b>Discovery</b> aboard their NASA Boeing 747 carrier aircraft in 1981 and 1985, respectively.|$|R
500|$|Some {{areas of}} Florida {{received}} over [...] of rain {{as the system}} moved slowly through the state. Heavy rains caused a large sinkhole to develop on Interstate 95 in Palm Beach County, which closed the highway to traffic. Similar to Hurricane Charley earlier in the month, the Florida citrus crops took large amounts of damage. Frances caused heavy damage to the large Vehicle Assembly Building at <b>the</b> Kennedy <b>Space</b> Center, ripping off 820 4-by-10foot aluminum panels covering the building. While Charley caused $700,000 damage (2004 dollars), Frances' damage was significantly greater. Two external fuel tanks for <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> were in <b>the</b> building but seemed undamaged. <b>The</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery's</b> hangar was without power. The total damage to space and military facilities around Cape Canaveral, Florida was reported at about $100million (2004 dollars). Orlando, Florida's theme parks closed Sundayâ€” only the third time Walt Disney World closed for a hurricane, but {{the second time in}} a month.|$|R
50|$|Morelos I was Mexico's first {{communications}} satellite.

500|$|In 2009, NASA {{engineered}} a new treadmill for the International Space Station. It {{was brought}} to the ISS by <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> during the STS-128 mission in August 2009. The complex machine is now used eight hours daily by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station in order to maintain their muscle mass and bone density while spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity environment. While engineers at NASA were constructing this treadmill, it was simply called T-2 for more than two years. However, on April 14, 2009, NASA renamed it the [...] "Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill", or COLBERT. NASA named the treadmill after Colbert, who took an interest during the Node 3 naming census for the ISS module, Tranquility.|$|E
500|$|... 1995 {{began with}} the launch of <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Discovery</b> on February 3. Discovery's mission, STS-63, was the second Space Shuttle flight in {{the program and the}} first flight of the shuttle with a female pilot, Eileen Collins. Referred to as the [...] "near-Mir" [...] mission, the eight-day flight saw the first {{rendezvous}} of a Space Shuttle with Mir, as Russian Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov and the rest of Discoverys crew approached within [...] of Mir. Following the rendezvous, Collins performed a flyaround of the station. The mission, a dress rehearsal for the first docked mission in the program, STS-71, also carried out testing of various techniques and pieces of equipment that would be used during the docking missions that followed.|$|E
