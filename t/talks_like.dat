25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword {{in one hand and}} a long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They spend a lot of time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E
500|$|Actor Billy Bob Thornton {{admitted}} to {{watching the show}} during a 2016 interview with GQ. He and his daughter Bella used to watch My Little Pony, which she eventually grew out of, and when searching for the series to watch again, came across Friendship Is Magic and started watching it with her. He also liked the show's positive messages about how the world works, pointing to [...] "The Cutie Map" [...] as an example. On an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, Thornton also claimed that while his daughter's favorite character is Twilight Sparkle, his favorites were Fluttershy (who he said was his favorite because [...] "she <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> Marilyn Monroe") and Rainbow Dash.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{power of}} Saruman's voice is noted {{throughout}} the book. Jonathan Evans calls {{the characterization of}} Saruman in the chapter The Voice of Saruman a [...] "tour de force". Roger Sale says of the same chapter that [...] "Tolkien valiantly tried to do something worth doing which he simply cannot bring off." [...] Tom Shippey writes that [...] "Saruman <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> a politician ... No other character in Middle-earth has Saruman's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved, and none comes out with words as empty as 'deploring', 'ultimate', worst of all, 'real'. What is 'real change'?" [...] Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King Dáin, which Shippey believes represent Tolkien's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf.|$|E
500|$|As September began, {{while on}} the {{campaign}} trail in Iowa, Biden confided to the Associated Press that he was [...] "counting on Iowa a lot". He hoped to come in [...] "first, second or an indistinguishable third" [...] and if not he would leave the campaign trail and return to Washington. His early statements seemed to mirror the future as he would ultimately drop out of the race after finishing lower than third in the Iowa Caucus. The results also presented a refutation of what he stated in September 2007 when he said that the campaign was [...] "gaining some traction [...]" [...] The September 2007 assessments made by University of Iowa professor Bruce Gronbeck and Drake University professor Dennis Goldford displayed more merit {{at the end of the}} race after Gronbeck stated that Biden was not gaining traction in the race and with Goldford adding that [...] " [...] <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> a senator, not a president". Democratic strategist Ron Parker argued in September that Biden still had a chance but just had to sell his case to the American people.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968 there was widespread rioting and disorder across the US. The trouble reached Baltimore on April 6, {{and for the next}} three days and nights the city burned. Agnew {{declared a state of emergency}} and called out the National Guard. When order was restored there were six dead, more than 4,000 were under arrest, the fire department had responded to 1,200 fires, and there had been widespread looting. On April 11, Agnew summoned more than 100 moderate black leaders to the state capitol, where instead of the expected constructive dialogue he delivered a speech roundly castigating them for their failure to control more radical elements, and accused them of a cowardly retreat or even complicity. One of the delegates, the Rev. Sidney Daniels, rebuked the governor: [...] "Talk to us like we are ladies and gentlemen", he said, before walking out. Others followed him; the remnant was treated to further accusations as Agnew rejected all socio-economic explanations for the disturbances. Many white suburbanites applauded Agnew's speech: over 90 percent of the 9,000 responses by phone, letter or telegram supported him, and he won tributes from leading Republican conservatives such as Jack Williams, governor of Arizona, and former senator William Knowland of California. To members of the black community the April 11 meeting was a turning point. Having previously welcomed Agnew's stance on civil rights, they now felt betrayed, one state senator observing: [...] "He has sold us out ... he thinks like George Wallace, he <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> George Wallace".|$|E

5000|$|In {{interview}} Sachs {{also had}} a funny anecdote about the casting of Arye Gross who played gang member Turbo in the movie: [...] "He came in and read for me, and he was <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> Marlon Brando, through his nose. It was fantastic, so I gave him the part. And when we did the scene, he didn’t <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> that. I said, ‘You’re not <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> you did in your reading!’ And he said, ‘I had a cold.'" ...|$|R
500|$|Angel season four {{played with}} audience's {{expectations}} of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, [...] "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy." [...] She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; [...] director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode [...] "Orpheus" [...] because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new [...] "schizophrenic madwoman" [...] characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a [...] 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline [...] "freaked him out." [...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E

2500|$|Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy novel Too Many Magicians (1966) {{includes}} an appearance by the Marquis of London, a fat genius who looks and <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> Nero Wolfe, never leaves home, and is intensely {{interested in his}} hybridized plants. He has an assistant, Lord Bontriomphe (a literal French translation of [...] "Goodwin"), who is first seen examining an exhibition of plants (like Archie in [...] "Black Orchids"), and a cook corresponding to Fritz Brenner. The title pays homage to that of many Nero Wolfe stories, from Too Many Cooks (1938) to Too Many Clients (1960).|$|E

2500|$|During his twenties, Sundar Singh's Gospel work widened greatly, {{and long}} before he was thirty, his name and picture were {{familiar}} all over the Christian world. He described a struggle with Satan to retain his humility, but people described him as always human, approachable and humble, {{with a sense of}} fun and a love of nature. This character, with his illustrations from ordinary life, gave his addresses great impact. Many people said, [...] "He not only looks like Jesus, he <b>talks</b> <b>like</b> Jesus must have talked." [...] His talks and his personal speech were informed by his habitual early morning meditation, especially on the gospels. In 1918 he made a long tour of South India and Ceylon, and the following year he was invited to Burma, Malaya, China and Japan.|$|E
