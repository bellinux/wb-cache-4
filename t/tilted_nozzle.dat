40|$|The {{dripping}} {{dynamics of}} Newtonian liquids emanating from a <b>tilted</b> <b>nozzle</b> is studied. A high speed camera is employed {{to observe the}} drop breakup process. The level of viscosity, flow rate, nozzle diameter, and nozzle inclination angle had been varied independently. The drop break up time tb, which is the time interval between two subsequent drops, and the different modes of dripping have been identified. The new experiments reveal that increasing the nozzle inclination angle results in lowering the drop breakup times for all viscosities and nozzle diameters investigated, suggesting that the surface tension forces cannot hold the drops longer despite the weakened effective gravitational pull. This counter-intuitive finding is further corroborated by pendant drop experiments and computations. In the modes of dripping, as the liquid flow rate increases, the system transitions from period- 1 (P 1) dripping to limit cycle (LC) before showing chaotic (C) responses. A phase diagram showing the transition between the different dripping modes for different nozzle inclination angle is constructed in the (We, Ka) space, where We (Weber number) measures {{the relative importance of}} inertia to surface tension force and Ka (Kapitza number) measures the relative importance of viscous to surface tension forces. At low values of We and Ka, the system shows a transition from period- 1 to limit cycle before chaos. The limit cycle region narrows down with increase in inclination. Further increase in the values of We and Ka gives a direct transition from period- 1 to chaos. The experimental volumes of primary drops by image analysis show good agreement with the volumes obtained from the correlation developed, showing a maximum of 15...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{feasibility}} study of jet propulsion for remote operated vehicles (ROV’s). The concept {{of using a}} <b>tilting</b> type <b>nozzle</b> for improved maneuverability is discussed. Though the propulsion efficiency of jets is less {{compared to that of}} the propeller for the velocity ranges usually encountered in ROV movements, the implementation of jet propulsion is considered in view of the advantages in improving maneuvering qualities. Also, the simplicity of the system and les complexity in pressure compensation adds to its advantages. This study concentrates on the selection of an optimum nozzle configuration for ROV’s. [...] An experimental set-up was designed and fabricated for this investigation. Ten different plexi-glass conical nozzles were used for five different circular disk shaped drag plates, simulating the drag of the ROV motion under water. Energy losses were determined both experimentally and theoretically. Wall effects encountered in the experimental tank were compensated by towing the model in an open water wave tank for the same range of speeds. It was found that the propulsion efficiency is maximum for one particular nozzle over a wide range of flow rates encountered in the experiments. Finally, a feasible design of a jet propelled ROV with <b>tilting</b> type <b>nozzles</b> is presented. This design could be fabricated and tested for commercial production...|$|R
50|$|Shot in Lyon in {{the spring}} of 1895, the film portrays a simple {{practical}} joke in which a gardener is tormented by a boy who steps on the hose that the gardener is using to water his plants, cutting off the water flow. When the gardener <b>tilts</b> the <b>nozzle</b> up to inspect it, the boy releases the hose, causing the water to spray him. The gardener is stunned and his hat is knocked off, but he soon catches on. A chase ensues, both on and off-screen (the camera never moves from its original position) until the gardener catches the boy and administers a spanking. The entire film lasts only 45 seconds, but this simple bit of slapstick may be the forerunner of all subsequent film comedy.|$|R

40|$|Premixed charge {{compression}} ignition {{mode of operation}} simultaneously reduces oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter with improved fuel economy. Late injection is one such strategy to achieve premixed charge {{compression ignition}} mode along with the control over the ignition timing. Late injection along with charge dilution retards combustion and prepares homogeneous mixture by providing sufficient ignition delay. The in-cylinder charge distribution dictates mixture formation which affects the performance and emissions characteristics. Experimental results fail to provide an insight of the in-cylinder processes involved. Hence, numerical simulations have been performed to get in-cylinder distributions of scalars, which help in understanding the combustion process. The work consists of late in-cylinder injection of Diesel wherein the heat release rate trace shows only a premixed mode with lower soot and NOx. The absence of diffusion combustion confirms that the engine operates in a premixed charge compression ignition mode. In this work, effects of various injection parameters and swirl ratio on engine in-cylinder processes, performance and exhaust emissions have been studied using a three-dimensional model with detailed chemistry by using Converge, a computational fluid dynamics tool. Increasing swirl ratio improved air-fuel mixing causing lower soot emission {{up to a certain}} limit beyond which further increase in swirl ratio led to higher soot emission due to increased heat loss. Delayed start of injection resulted in delayed combustion leading to lower soot and NOx emission but partial oxidation resulted in higher carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. <b>Nozzle</b> <b>tilt</b> angle beyond 70 degrees {{led to the formation of}} fuel-rich mixture at the center of combustion chamber resulting in higher soot and CO emissions. A narrow spray cone angle improved air-fuel mixing leading to lower soot but produced higher NOx. Medium swirl with late injection timing and wide <b>nozzle</b> <b>tilt</b> angle along with narrower spray cone angle resulted in lower emissions without deteriorating engine performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{printing}} of {{a thin line}} of liquid onto a moving flat solid substrate was studied numerically. For a fixed value of the Capillary number, the window of steady state deposition was explored {{in terms of the}} substrate-nozzle gap and flow rate parameter space for two nozzle configurations: a nozzle pointing vertically at the plate and a <b>nozzle</b> slightly <b>tilted</b> towards the substrate motion direction. A lower limit for the flow rate was found, below which no steady state solutions could be obtained. This minimum flow rate increases as the nozzle stand-off and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tilting</b> do. Solutions near this lower flow rate boundary were stable under a flow rate perturbation. The process was also studied experimentally and the measurements were compared with the corresponding numerical simulations, giving a fairly good agreement, except in the advancing front deposition region...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} paper, predictive modelling of NOx emission of a 210 MW capacity pulverized coal-fired boiler and combustion parameter optimization to reduce NOx emission in flue gas is proposed. The effects of oxygen concentration in flue gas, coal properties, coal flow, boiler load, air distribution scheme, flue gas outlet temperature and <b>nozzle</b> <b>tilt</b> are studied.   The {{data collected from}} parametric field experiments are used to build a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural net (ANN). The coal combustion parameters are used as inputs and NOx emission as outputs of the model. The ANN model is developed for full load condition and its predicted values are verified with the actual values. The algebraic equation containing weights and biases of the trained net is used as fitness function in simulated annealing (SA) to find the optimum level of input operating conditions for low NOx emission. The result proves that the proposed approach {{could be used for}} generating feasible operating conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} convective heat transfer in a multiple-jet systems composed of straight and inclined slot nozzles. The application concerned is the fast cooling of moving strip. The experimental approach involves the application of infrared thermography associated with the steady-state heated foil technique. Three-dimensional numerical simulations performed with the code FLUENT compare agreeably with the IR data. The study aims {{to determine the effect}} on the average heat transfer coefficient of the slot Reynolds number up to the value of 100000, the nozzle spacing normalised by the slot hydraulic diameter in the range 6 £ W/S £ 18, the normalised nozzle emergence length, E/S, from 5 to 17 and the normalised nozzle to strip standoff distance Z/S from 3 to 10. The geometrical arrangements tested include perpendicular (90 º) and <b>tilted</b> (60 º) <b>nozzles.</b> A thermal entrainment phenomenon is found for cooling system of small width. A corrective factor is derived to account for this effect. The experimental findings are compared with existing correlation; deviations, which are observed at high values of the Reynolds number may reach 25 %.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCold flow {{tests were conducted}} on a four <b>nozzle</b> (<b>nozzles</b> <b>tilted</b> at a 15 degree angle) gas educator system to evaluate the system's performance utilizing a short slotted missing stack and two shrouds with diffuser rings. The stack length-to-diameter ratio, (L/D), was 1. 0, and with the shroud and diffuser rings extended to L/D to 1. 5. The difference in the two shrouds was the separation distance between stack and shroud and between shroud and diffuser rings. This separation distance resulted in exit diffuser angles of 10. 8 and 7. 3 degrees. The nozzles were constructed with a ratio of total area of primary flow to area of mixing stack of 2. 5. Secondary and tertiary pumping coefficients, mixing stack pressure distributions, and exit velocity profiles were {{used to evaluate the}} shrouded mixing stacks. The stack and shrouds were evaluated with the stack slots closed and then with the slots open. Secondary pumping was found to be independent of changes in diffuser angle. Tertiary pumping decreased with the separation distance and only showed a slight increase when the slots were opened. The 7. 3 degree shroud had a lower tertiary flow; however, in the regions of low flow at the exit plane, the severity of the velocity fluctuations was much reduced and hence better overall performance was achieved.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{numerical}} experiment is conducted {{to study the}} effect of the combination of complex nozzle sweep and lean on the performance of the steam turbine LPC last stage. To perform the numerical experiment, an automated search procedure has been developed using the CFD package NUMECA and the program IOSO. This procedure is designed to search for a combination of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tilt</b> angles, which are key ones to determine the laws of the nozzle sweep and lean. The target function of the optimization process is the maximum efficiency level at constant mass flow rate of steam. The sweep and lean angles and the stagger of the nozzle were varying values during the search. To calculate the span-wise distribution of kinetic energy losses in last stage nozle on the basis of CFD calculation of vapor flow, using the Numeca CFView software, the article offers a method based on the calculation of steam parameters along the individual conditional streamlines. In the CFView program this method is implemented using the integrated programming language Python. As a result of the numerical experiment, the combination of angles has been found to improve the efficiency level by 1. 8 %, and reduce the total kinetic energy losses in the nozzle by 1. 6 %. Application the combined sweep and lean resulted in a decrease in the mass flow rate of steam in the shroud area, and due to this, increase in the hub area. The redistribution of the mass flow rate of steam and preload of the vapor flow to the hub led to decreasing the static pressure gradient and the reactivity degree in the nozzle height. Reduction of the pressure gradient and the preload of the vapor stream to the hub led to a decrease in the intensity of secondary flows at the hub area. The local preload of the steam flow to the shroud together with decreasing pressure gradient resulted in reduced intensity of secondary flows and reduced losses of kinetic energy in the shroud area. Increase in the static pressure in the lower third of the nozzle in the section between the nozzle and the bucket under constant static pressure before the nozzle led to a decrease of the Mach number and the decrease in the intensity of shock waves. An increasing gap between the nozzle and bucket in the shroud area because of the nozzle sweep should reduce the erosive wear of {{the leading edge of the}} last stage bucket. </p...|$|R
