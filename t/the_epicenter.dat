5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> in Cuautepec.|$|E

5|$|When {{a second}} {{simultaneous}} set of earthquakes occur, the parallel universe's version of Nick Lane (David Call) approaches Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) {{of the prime}} universe, believing {{him to be the}} parallel universe's version of Lee. Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions of being at <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> of the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, <b>the</b> <b>epicenter</b> is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E

A future earthquake {{in the region is}} extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois–Indiana border or the New Madrid fault zone.|$|E

The width of the aftershock distribution narrows near the hypocenter of the mainshock rupture (section  01 in Fig.  2 b). However, the northern extension of the aftershock distribution is sporadic and aligns along a conjugate west-dipping fault plane (sections  05 and 06 in Fig.  2 b). Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>epicenters</b> to <b>the</b> south of the mainshock hypocenter are tightly aligned along an ENE–WSW-striking plane. The depth sections indicate a fault plane dipping steeply (70 °– 80 °) to the southeast (sections  07 – 10 in Fig.  2 b). This fault plane is adjacent to a fault plane near the mainshock hypocenter that dips at ~[*] 45 ° toward the east, but the two fault planes {{do not appear to}} intersect.|$|R
