5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E

40|$|There the {{grinding}} processes of tool steels {{and the working}} processes of parts with <b>the</b> use of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tungstenless steels have been studied. The study purpose is to rise <b>the</b> efficieng of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new tongstenless steels by means of grinding condition optimization. The relation mechanisms between {{the grinding}} process variables, the surface layer quality and the tool reliability have been brought out. The mathematical models and the design programs for the optimization of grinding conditions of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tungstenless steels have been developed. The recommendations about the wheel characteristic choice and about the grinding regime choice for <b>the</b> cutting <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tungstenless steels have been given. The rational application fields of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tungstenless steels at the machining have been determined. The study results {{have been sent to}} the works and have been used at the grinding (sharpening) of <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tungstenless steels and at the machining of parts of petroleum-production equipmentAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{study of}} partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, {{it is possible}} to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} career, Teller made {{contributions}} to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects), and surface physics. His extension of Fermi's theory of beta decay (in {{the form of}} the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions) provided an important stepping stone in the applications of this theory. The Jahn–Teller effect and the BET theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern <b>tool</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored a paper which is a standard starting point for the applications of the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics.|$|E
