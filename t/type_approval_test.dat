The {{gaseous emissions}} (NOx, HC, CO and CO 2) were measured using the typical <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedure for light duty vehicles. Since all the vehicles tested had been certified using the relevant current legislative cycle (i. e. NEDC or EDC), these vehicles were clearly not optimized for the WMTC cycle.

In this respect several aspects must be addressed, such as the representativeness of different test duty cycles versus real driving, the impact of different environmental conditions {{as well as the}} energy demand of auxiliaries in different operation conditions. In the last years the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has initiated pre-normative research on hybrid and battery electric vehicles, in order to support policy makers with independent expertise to define better and more representative EU <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedures for electrified vehicles, and harmonise the current reference EU regulation at global level in the framework of the activities of the UNECE.

Euro 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 differ (beside vehicle preconditioning and warm-up procedures introduced since Euro 3) only because limits for the different pollutants have been progressively lowered. This paper analyses {{through a number of}} experimental tests on spark-ignition cars, a hybrid and a conventional vehicle, the driving conditions responsible for most of the emissions and assesses how such conditions are reproduced by the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test.</b> The engine conditions mostly responsible for emissions are: warm-up phase, full loads and transients. Only the warm-up is well covered by the NEDC for vehicles with more than 35 kW/ton power-weight ratio. Tests performed with the Honda Hybrid (the low environmental impact vehicle) and with the Alfa Romeo 147 1. 6 (the conventional vehicle) showed how on the NEDC most emissions are produced in the warm up phase and are of the same order of magnitude for both cars while on more realistic driving cycles (ARTEMIS cycles have been used here) the capacity of the Hybrid to mitigate the transients effects results in a much lower emission rate. Full load conditions are not kept under control by the Hybrid as by the conventional vehicle when the O 2 exhaust sensor is disabled and the air-fuel ratio is no more stoichiometric. Even though this paper has not tested all possible vehicles types, it shows that European type {{approval procedure}} has some weaknesses in accounting for the main causes of vehicle emissions.

Drivers were asked to drive normally and not requested to do anything special but to scrupulously follow the given itinerary. Results Two main results were obtained: average and maximum emission levels for the three cars are quantified; the effects of the drivers on such levels assessed. The conventional car (with two people and 250 kg of measurement tools onboard) consumes an average of 12. 6 l/ 100 km, its CO 2 emissions range between 200 g/km and 300 g/km with an average of 260 g/km.

In the course of the development of WLTP, the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission has tested gaseous emissions of twenty-one Euro 4 – 6 gasoline and diesel vehicles, on both the current European <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> procedure (NEDC) and the progressive versions of the WLTP. The results, which should be regarded just as an initial and qualitative indication of the trends, demonstrated minimal average differences between CO 2 emissions over the NEDC and WLTP. On the other hand, CO 2 emissions measured at JRC on the NEDC were on average 9 % higher than the respective type approval values, therefore suggesting that for the tested vehicles, CO 2 emissions over WLTP were almost 10 % higher than the respective NEDC type approval values. That difference is likely to increase with application of the full WLTP test procedure. Measured THC emissions from most vehicles stayed below the legal emission limits and in general were lower under the WLTP compared to NEDC. Moving from NEDC to WLTP did not have much impact on NOx from gasoline vehicles and CO from diesel vehicles. On the contrary, NOx from diesel vehicles and CO from low-powered gasoline vehicles were significantly higher over the more dynamic WLTP and in several cases exceeded the emission limits. Results from this study can be considered indicative of emission patterns of modern technology vehicles and useful to both policy makers and vehicle manufacturers in developing future emission policy/technology strategies.

40|$|AbstractThe World-wide {{harmonized}} Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP) issued as UNECE GTR No. 15 {{is designed}} to check the emissions compliance of Light Duty Vehicles (LDVs) {{around the world and}} European Commission is planning to introduce the WLTP in the European Type Approval process starting on 1 September 2017. WLTP has greatly reduced the flexibilities that are in the NEDC procedure and has eliminated many loopholes. However a certain degree of flexibility in the test procedure is necessary, otherwise no <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> would be valid. In order to lower the impact of those flexibilities having influence on CO 2 emissions, a European Task Force dealing with the corrections of WLTP flexibilities was established. The work presented in this paper shows the result of the practical implementation of some corrections, such as imbalances in the state of charge (SOC) of the battery, deviations against the target road load, target speed, target distance, and target soak temperature. These corrections have been applied also to NEDC tests, in order to compare their impact with WLTP corrections. The repeatability “r” (test-to-test variations) and the reproducibility “R” (lab-to-lab variations) of CO 2 results measured in different laboratories, for the same vehicles, are evaluated before and after the normalization. In summary, all corrections steps performed in this study influenced the average CO 2 emissions by approximately 1. 3 % and 3. 8 %, for WLTP and NEDC respectively, which in our opinion is an indication of the reduction of flexibilities from NEDC to WLTP. This initial analysis {{of the impact of the}} correction on the repeatability and reproducibility of test results shows promising potential, however it must be pointed out also that in several cases the application of this methodology has led to a worsening of either r and/or R. In particular, the correction of the Road Load coefficients seems to have practical issues of difficult solutions. Further tests and analyses are needed and expected for a better understanding of this issue and for the improvement of the whole procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of the effect of various fuel economy technologies on the certified CO 2 emissions of light duty vehicles. The vehicles operate under two different driving cycles, namely the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP), which is considered closer to real world driving and {{is going to be the}} new <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> in the near future. The study focuses on the comparative evaluation of the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions under these two driving cycles. To this aim, simulation models for a number of passenger cars were developed and validated against test data, generated via a specifically developed test protocol. In order to cover a large share of the market, the European fleet was divided into a number of segments based on specific vehicle characteristics and technologies, and representative vehicles for each segment were chosen. In order to minimize flexibilities and sources of uncertainty, the models were developed according to a standardized modelling procedure, based on the development of a reference “template model”. AVL's Cruise was used as simulation platform. The various components and modules for each vehicle model, as well as the respective input parameters, were defined with the support of the respective OEMs. After gaining confidence in the simulation models for all the vehicles considered in the present work, additional technologies, such as start-stop, brake energy recuperation and different drivetrain configurations, were implemented in each model. Specific strategies have been defined for the implementation of individual technologies and, where needed, additional algorithms were developed in Cruise. The results show that the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions is different between NEDC and WLTP, owing to the different characteristics of each cycle. For example, the effect of start-stop on CO 2 emissions is larger in NEDC, due to longer idling periods compared to WLTP. In this context, the results of this study can provide useful indications for the most effective fuel economy technologies under the new type approval procedure...|$|E
40|$|Durability {{testing of}} {{materials}} exposed to natural weathering requires testing of the ultraviolet (UV) stability, especially for polymeric materials. The <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> of photovoltaic (PV) modules according to standards IEC 61215 and IEC 61646, which includes a so-called UV preconditioning test with a total UV dose of 15 kWh/m(2), does not correspond to the real loads during lifetime. Between 3 %- 10 % of the UV radiation {{has to be in}} the spectral range between 280 and 320 nm (UV-B) in the recent editions of the standards. However, the spectral distribution of the radiation source is very important because different samples show very individual spectral sensitivity for the radiation offered. Less than 6 % of the intensity of solar radiation exists in the UV range. In the case of an increase of the intensity of the light source for accelerating the UV test, overheating of the samples would have to be prevented more rigorously and the temperature of the samples have to be measured to avoid misinterpretation of the test results...|$|R
40|$|The PMP is an inter-governmental {{research}} programme conducted {{under the auspices}} of UNECE GRPE to develop new vehicle exhaust particle measurement procedures for regulatory use. The PMP was inaugurated due to health concerns over nanoparticles and concerns over the ability of the current particulate mass measurement method to enable the forced adoption of technologies which effectively control their emissions. The PMP mandate was to develop techniques to replace or complement the particulate mass measurement method that must be applicable to Light Duty Vehicle & Heavy Duty Engine <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>testing.</b> A further objective was to provide data on the performance of different vehicle technologies according to the new measurement procedures. The PMP has proceeded in 3 phases: ¿	Phase I (2001 - 2) developed protocols for examining different candidate measurement systems. ¿	Phase II (2002 - 3) evaluated a range of measurement techniques and sample conditioning systems. ¿	Phase III (2004 -) is validating the recommended measurement techniques via inter laboratory test programmes.

40|$|Modern railway {{vehicles}} are requested to achieve improved performances together with higher safety for passengers and crew: {{for this reason}} recent European and National Standards claim for more demanding <b>tests</b> for <b>type</b> <b>approval.</b> In this contest, the initial phase of <b>type</b> <b>approval’s</b> <b>tests</b> became very important {{in order to achieve}} good results before the on line tests. This paper deals with the set up of test bench to perform <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> on carbody, used for the new Italian double deck coaches. This bench is composed by two longitudinal beams headed by two crossbeams: at one side hydraulic actuators are placed in order to apply the requested load. With a simple procedures is available to perform compression test on bumpers and also compression or traction test on a coupler a worm screw it is possible to apply both traction or compression loads to the carbody. At the other side there is only a reaction crossbeam, rigidly connected with the longitudinal member. Moreover a truss structure should be mounted at one end in order to apply the load at higher levels. The reaction is, however, provided at the other side at bumper level, as stated in the European norm EN 12663. So, this test bench allowed to perform traction and compression tests, at bumpers level or in higher position (window level or roof). The driving/trailer and the trailer double deck coaches tested with this new test bench will compose the 60 new 5 coaches “Vivalto” regional train of Trenitalia developed from October 2005, with the main following characteristics: - Number of seats/places: 90 / 126 - Maximum speed: 160 Km/h The first phase regarded compression tests at bumper level. The European Standard (EN 12663) provide for 2 x 1000 kN symmetric load applied on the head beam of the carbody in the bumper zone and for 2000 kN on the coupler area. Moreover diagonal compression tests are requested: this test is performed applying a force up to 500 kN at one bumper, reacting at the opposite side. The test bench is able, with small adjustments, to provide traction test on the couplers, applying up to 1500 kN, as suggested in the EN 12663 Standard for different types of automatic coupler. In addition, the EN standard provides for compression tests at different height, applying high level loads (up to 400 kN) up to the roof level, by means of an auxiliary truss structure between test bench and carbody. Thusthese compression tests were performed in the third phase: 400 kN 150 mm over the bumpers, 300 kN at window level and 300 kN at the roof level. In the full paper the results of the test listed before will be summarised giving the evidence of the great correspondence with the results of FEM calculations...|$|R
