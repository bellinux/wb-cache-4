5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Chajoma of Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) initially allied themselves with <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> together with the Kaqchikel kingdom of Iximche, and that they also rebelled against <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> in 1524. It is known that when the lords of Iximche broke their alliance with the conquistadors, they took refuge in Jilotepeque. The site was abandoned after <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> conquest and the inhabitants were moved by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> to San Martín Jilotepeque, after which the area was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> {{continued}} {{to strengthen their}} blockade of trade activities in the Sulu Archipelago, resulting in the blockade's opposition by Germans when many of their trading ships were seized by Spain. Both Berlin and London stated the archipelago should remain open to world trade route. Soon, the British began to co-operate with German when rumours about the seizure of their trading ship by <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> began arriving to Great Britain which lead the British to oppose <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> action. British and Germans then refused to recognise <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> sovereignty over Sulu. But with strong opposition from Germans over the illegal seizures of their ships and the British fear of the German presence (which was stronger than <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> during the time), a protocol known as Madrid Protocol was then signed in Madrid to secure Spanish sovereignty over the archipelago, making <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> free to wage any war with the Sultanate of Sulu without the fear of other foreign western powers intervening and as a return <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> would not intervene {{in the affairs of}} British in northern Borneo.|$|E

5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northwards to Sacapulas and climbed the steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold {{and set it on}} fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders and the next day Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> as soon as news of the battle reached them. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> infantry eventually decided the battle. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves.

By the end of the battle, <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> had lost over fifty men, more than half their number, and five more men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned. The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Diego Velázquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold.

5|$|After {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Cuchumatanes fell to <b>the</b> <b>Spanish,</b> the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, {{four years after the}} conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> decided that military action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> army then marched east toward Uspantán itself; Arias then received notice that the acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, had deposed him as magistrate.

As soon as <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. <b>The</b> <b>Spanish</b> forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed on the altar of their deity Exbalamquen.

5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion.

In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters.

Finally, in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line.
