5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed.

The greater the deformation of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E

5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The base of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few}} hundred feet. Because <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> over the valleys would be thicker than <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively.

5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> becomes more transparent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a Neural Network (NN) identification of icing parameters in an A 340 aircraft and a reconfiguration technique {{to keep the}} A/C performance close to the performance prior to icing. Five aircraft parameters {{are assumed to be}} considerably affected by <b>icing.</b> <b>The</b> off-line training for identifying <b>the</b> clear and <b>iced</b> dynamics is based on the Levenberg-Marquard Backpropagation algorithm. <b>The</b> <b>icing</b> parameters are located in the system matrix. The physical locations of <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> are assumed at the right and left wings. The reconfiguration is based on the technique known as the control mixer approach or pseudo inverse technique. This technique generates the new control input vector such that the A/C dynamics is not much affected by <b>icing.</b> In <b>the</b> simulations, the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of an Airbus A 340 aircraft model are considered, and the stability derivatives affected by <b>icing</b> are identified. <b>The</b> simulation results show the successful NN identification of <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> parameters and <b>the</b> reconfigured flight dynamics having the similar performance before <b>the</b> <b>icing.</b> In other words, <b>the</b> destabilizing <b>icing</b> affect is compensated...|$|R
