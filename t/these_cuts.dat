5|$|One {{week before}} Greeds release the New York State Motion Picture Committee (which censored films) demanded several more cuts on moral grounds. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> {{included}} {{the administration of}} ether in the dental scenes and certain instances of foul language. Although <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> were made to prints that were screened in New York State, the footage was kept in many other prints.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are also}} cut from grazing animals, usually farmed, other than cattle, {{including}} bison, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, reindeer, turkey, deer and zebu {{as well as}} various types of fish, especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish, shark and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon and veal, <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> are {{often referred to as}} chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.|$|E
50|$|Larger mills have {{recently}} {{come on the}} market which are portable only in sections. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> faster and can handle larger logs but do require additional set up.|$|R
25|$|Sawtooth bits {{are also}} available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have {{advantages}} over Forstner bits when boring into end grain.|$|R
50|$|Early flapwheels {{were large}} {{diameter}} and {{intended for use}} on fixed buffing machines. They were used for deburring and polishing of castings, often instead of wire wheels. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> faster, with less burnishing and surface contamination from the bristles.|$|R
5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E
5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With <b>these</b> <b>cuts,</b> Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play. Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.|$|E

50|$|Between 1910 and 1915 {{there were}} seven trains per day but the advent of World War 1 saw <b>these</b> <b>cut</b> back to six by 1917. Four of these worked through from Norwich, the other two from Tivetshall (the main line junction).|$|R

50|$|There is {{one type}} of plane with faces: a flattended {{triangular}} tiling {{with half of the}} triangles as holes. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> face-diagonally through the original cubes. There are also square tiling plane that exist as nonface holes passing through the centers of the octahedral cells.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the film}} was passed uncut with an 'X' {{certificate}} for its UK theatrical run, the 18-rated VHS release suffered 17 secs of BBFC cuts which considerably reduced the violence and nudity during the murder of Karen in the jacuzzi. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> were eventually waived for the 2002 Sanctuary DVD, and all subsequent releases were fully uncut.|$|E
25|$|Modern cutting {{technology}} {{has allowed the}} development of increasingly complex and hitherto unthinkable shapes, such as stars and butterflies. Their proportions are mostly {{a matter of personal}} preference; however, due to their sharp terminations and diamond's relative fragility, <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> are more vulnerable to accidental breakage and may therefore be more difficult to insure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008 Ryanair {{announced}} a large cut in capacity {{at a number of}} airports, including Stansted, from October 2008 to March 2009, although Blackpool was not affected by <b>these</b> <b>cuts.</b> However, on 25 November 2008 Ryanair announced the intention to withdraw all flights from 5 January 2009 following the airport's introduction of a £10 per person Airport Development Fee.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, about 25 minutes {{worth of}} some very short censored black and white 16mm film clips were {{recovered}} from the National Archive vaults, snipped by the censor {{from a variety of}} 1960s episodes, <b>these</b> <b>cut</b> portions of 16mm film had not been {{in the hands of the}} ABC, and had been impounded by the Australian censors.|$|R

50|$|The California {{mountains}} {{rose and}} shifted several times {{within the last}} fifty million years, and each time, old streambeds moved and were dried out, leaving the deposits of gold resting within the ancient gravel beds where the gold had been collecting. Newer rivers and streams then developed, and some of <b>these</b> <b>cut</b> through the old channels, carrying the gold into still larger concentrations.|$|R
25|$|Risson's era saw ongoing {{industrial}} disputes, regarding pay, bus operation (the union {{insisted on}} two-person operation of 41+ seat buses), {{and even the}} implementation of a summer uniform. There were also cuts to all-night and Sunday tram services, and the abandonment of the Point Ormond line, and Footscray system. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> were part of Risson's economy drive, justified by low patronage and a need to decrease costs.|$|E
25|$|Slowly {{other child}} {{agencies}} such as The Radio Research Center and Electronics & Tech. Services were added to R in the 1970s and 1990s. In the 1970s the Special Frontier Force moved to R's control, working to train Bengali rebels. In 1977, R's operations and staff were dramatically cut under the Premiership of Morarji Desai, which hurt the organizations capabilities with the shutting of entire sections of R, like its Information Division. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> were reduced following Gandhi's return.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} downturn {{that began in}} 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to <b>these</b> <b>cuts,</b> ASU capped enrollment, closed down about four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators; however, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses, and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in Lake Havasu City.|$|E

(The art style is slightly reminiscent of certain Philips CD-i titles' cut scenes.) ...|$|R
25|$|In 1996, Night Slave was {{a shooter}} RPG {{released}} for the PC-98 that combined the side-scrolling shooter gameplay of Assault Suits Valken and Gradius, including an armaments system that employs recoil physics, with many RPG {{elements such as}} permanently levelling up the mecha and various weapons using power-orbs obtained from defeating enemies as well as storyline <b>cut</b> scenes. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> scenes also occasionally contain lesbian adult content.|$|R
30|$|Islands {{attached}} to a step edge. Again these tend to form a circle-like structure but are hindered by the edge. The islands do not continue their extension {{on the other side}} of the edge but seem to be cut off. No tendency can be seen as to whether <b>these</b> <b>cut</b> islands appear more often on the upper or lower side of the step edges.|$|R
25|$|In 2011 Donnelly {{voted against}} H.R. 2219 {{which would have}} cut the U.S. {{military}} budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on weapons programs. Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.|$|E
25|$|Harris' {{government}} reduced Ontario {{welfare rolls}} by 500,000 people; critics contend <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> {{led to a}} rise in homelessness and poverty. Supporters argued that high welfare rates had created disincentives to find entry-level jobs, and that poverty levels remained relatively unchanged between 1995 and 2005. Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize. The previous NDP government's law outlawing the hiring of replacement workers during strikes was repealed.|$|E
25|$|Die-off could {{potentially}} be explained by pathogens of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013). Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails Littoraria irrorata make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass infections, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} is most easily visualized {{by using the}} stereographic projection described above. On the sphere one of <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> runs longitudinally through the southern hemisphere, connecting a point on the equator (z = 1) with another point on the equator (z = 1), and passing through the south pole (the origin, z = 0) on the way. The second version of the cut runs longitudinally through the northern hemisphere and connects the same two equatorial points by passing through the north pole (that is, the point at infinity).|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the BBFC cut the UK version by {{approximately}} 52 seconds, removing the sexual assault scene {{and images of}} throwing stars. <b>These</b> <b>cuts</b> were waived for the 2004 10th Anniversary release. Ninja Scroll was released in Australia by Manga UK in 1995 uncut with the MA15+ classification. In 1997 after it was screened on SBS, former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock controversially appealed the film's original classification and successfully had the classification upgraded to R18+ with no cuts. In January 1998 it broadcast twice on midnights on the new Teletoon station in Canada along with the Macross Plus trilogy.|$|E
25|$|Under the Pataki Administration, New York's {{credit rating}} was {{increased}} three times by Moody's Investors Service, {{a fact that}} he highlighted often before his critics. During his three terms in office, he introduced and approved more tax cuts {{than any of his}} predecessors. Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. New York's infamously high income tax rate dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following the attacks of September 11 and increasing state spending caused Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno to coordinate an effort to roll back a number of <b>these</b> <b>cuts</b> in 2003 over Pataki's veto power.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of <b>these</b> <b>cut</b> outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs. Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. <b>These</b> <b>cut</b> outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made {{in order to keep the}} ritual aspect separate.|$|R
