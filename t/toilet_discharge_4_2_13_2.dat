30|$|The {{major sources}} of total {{dissolved}} CO 2 contributing to aquatic systems are (1) diffusion of atmospheric CO 2 from the atmosphere, (2) hydrologic transport from upstream, (3) groundwater <b>discharge,</b> (<b>4)</b> CO <b>2</b> derived from organic matter decomposition within the water column and the soil, and (5) the dissolution of C minerals (Telmer and Veizer 1999; Finlay 2003). In some river and small stream systems, metabolism of C inputs appears to be greater than in situ primary production resulting in higher aqueous dissolved CO 2 than CO 2 in the atmosphere (Cole et al. 1994). A total metabolic balance is driven by factors that govern both primary production and respiration. Productivity can be influenced by nutrients, light availability, thermal cycle, hydrodynamics (i.e., current, velocity, mixing, etc.), internal loading of organic matter, and food web structure. Meanwhile, ecosystem respiration may be strongly subsidized by external loading of organic matter and nutrients (Odum 1956; Kling et al. 1991; Wetzel 1992; Cole et al. 2000; Hessen et al. 2004; Elser et al. 2007; Gu et al. 2011). Therefore, the combination and interaction of these factors influence the partitioning and conversion of C into distinct pools.|$|R

40|$|Mass {{loss from}} glaciers and ice sheets {{currently}} accounts for {{two-thirds of the}} observed global sea-level rise and has accelerated since the 1990 s, coincident with strong atmospheric warming in the Polar Regions. Here we present continuous GPS measurements and satellite synthetic aperture radar based velocity maps from the Austfonna ice cap, Svalbard, that demonstrate strong links between surface-melt and multiannual ice-flow acceleration. We identify a hydro-thermodynamic feedback that successively mobilizes stagnant ice regions, initially frozen to their bed, thereby facilitating fast basal motion over an expanding area. By autumn 2012, successive destabilization of the marine terminus escalated in a surge of the ice cap's largest drainage basin, Basin- 3.

The city of Nuevo Laredo {{proposes to}} {{rehabilitate}} and expand its drinking water distribution system and sewer collection system {{to service the}} city of Nuevo Laredo and its surrounding areas through the year 2020. Nuevo Laredo operates two water treatment plants (WTP) with design capacities of 2, 000 and 400 liters per second (45. 654 million gallons per day- MGD, and 9. 1308 MGD), respectively. These plants have deficiencies that must be corrected and are overloaded and able to serve only 92 percent of the population. About 45 percent of the potable water is lost with approximately 75 percent of the losses going into the sewer collectors to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The wastewater collection system is old and deteriorated. It can service only 87. 5 {{percent of the city}} and does not have the ability to handle the design flow.

The 69 [*] 457 individuals who registered for drug treatment in Scotland during 1 April 1996 - 31 March 2006. Time-at-risk was from the date of an individual's first attendance at drug treatment services after 1 April 1996 until the earlier date of death or end-of-study, 31 March 2006, and was categorized according to time since the most recent hospitalization, as during hospitalization, within 28 days, 29 - 90 days, 91 days to 1 year and > 1 year since discharge from most recent hospital stay versus 'never admitted' (reference).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{estimation}} of infarct size by biochemical myocardial necrosis markers {{is used in}} current clinical practice, rather than the more expensive and not always available imaging techniques. However, for this purpose, the peak value of serum biomarkers can overestimate the necrotic area, especially after reperfusion. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether late release cardiac troponin I (cTnI) values could predict more precisely infarct volume measured by delayed-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) in patients with acute myocardial infarction [ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) ] independently of reperfusion (spontaneous and provoked). METHODS: Sixty patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (55 STEMI and five NSTEMI) and normal function were enrolled. Among STEMI patients, 52 underwent reperfusion. cTnI and creatine kinase-myocardial band were assessed at admission and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h (+/- 1 h) from symptom onset. DE-CMR (Siemens Avanto 1. 5 T) was performed before <b>discharge</b> (<b>4</b> +/- <b>2</b> days). Infarct size was determined by manual delineation of the areas of delayed enhancement. Infarct volume was calculated as the sum of each slice of infarct size area multiplied by thickness. RESULTS: Peak cTnI was 55 +/- 59 ng/ml (range 0. 3 - 347). The area under the curve of cTnI was 1916 +/- 2224 ng/ml. The volume of infarcted myocardium assessed by DE-CMR was 27 +/- 25 ml (range 0 - 134). The single value of cTnI at 72 h after symptom onset provided the most accurate {{estimation of}} predischarge infarct volume (r = 0. 84, 95 % confidence interval 0. 75 - 0. 91) and was significantly more accurate than creatine kinase-myocardial band value assessed {{at any time during}} the same period (r = 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval 0. 19 - 0. 62; P < 0. 002).

In experiments on slices kept in 10 or 4 mM glucose (at 33 degreesC), hypoxia was applied until the pre-synaptic afferent volley disappeared - after 12 - 13 min in most slices, but much earlier (5 +/- 0. 8 min) in diabetic slices kept in 4 mM glucose. When oxygenation was resumed, the afferent volley returned in all slices, for an overall mean recovery of 86. 5 % (+/- 8. 8 %). Field post-synaptic potentials were fully blocked within 2 3 min of the onset of hypoxia. After the end of hypoxia, they failed to reappear in some slices: overall, their recovery varied between 62 and 68 % in control slices, {{as well as in}} diabetic slices kept in 10 mM glucose; but recovery was very, poor in diabetic slices kept in 4 mM glucose (only 15 +/- 0. 94 %).

Fish were released downstream from the fish bypass channel, and tracking began immediately using mobile multiplexed scanning receivers and GPS. In total there were 888 recorded positions of radiotagged northern pike over a 6 month period. Fish locations relative to the Port Davidson Weir allowed us to characterize specific discharge-dependent barriers to northern pike movement, and important spawning habitat. Movement patterns showed that northern pike were able to move upstream and downstream through the newly built bypass channel and weir constriction {{that was designed to}} improve river water quality. Passage rates at the Port Davidson Weir were 80 % for upstream migrating northern pike, and 50 % for downstream migrating northern pike. During the study period, there were 14 upstream movements through the Port Davidson Weir bypass channel from March 27 to April 24, with river discharge between 0. 7 and 15. 2 m 3 /s. Upstream movement peaked when river <b>discharge</b> was <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> - 6. <b>4</b> m 3 /s.

Fish were released upstream and downstream from the Canborough Weir on Oswego Creek to test bi-directional passage through the newly constructed fish bypass channel. Fish locations relative to the Canborough Weir revealed critical spawning habitat and the distribution of discharge-dependent barriers to fish movement within Oswego Creek. Movement patterns through the bypass channel indicated that northern pike were able to move upstream and downstream through a specific range of flows, rather than becoming stranded by low water levels upstream from the Canborough Weir. For northern pike that moved through the fish bypass channel, the initial upstream passage rate was 100 % (five out of five fish), and the overall downstream passage rate was 89 %.

The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is the threshold value in outcomes observed in a trial at which providers should choose to adopt a treatment. There has been limited assessment of MCID for outcomes after OHCA. Therefore, we conducted an international survey of individuals interested in cardiac resuscitation to define the MCID {{for a range of}} outcomes after OHCA. Methods: A brief survey instrument was developed and modified by consensus. Included were open-ended responses. The survey included an illustrative example of a hypothetical randomized study with distributions of outcomes based on those in a public use datafile from a previous trial. Elicited information included the minimum significant difference required in an outcome to change clinical practice. The population of interest was emergency physicians or other practitioners of acute cardiovascular research. Results: Usable responses were obtained from 160 respondents (50 % of surveyed) in 46 countries (79 % of surveyed). MCIDs tended to increase as baseline outcomes increased. For a population of patients with 25 % survival to discharge and 20 % favorable neurologic status at discharge, the MCID were median 5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3, 10) percent for survival to discharge; median 5 (IQR 2, 10) percent for favorable neurologic status at <b>discharge,</b> median <b>4</b> (IQR <b>2,</b> 9) days of ICU-free survival and median <b>4</b> (IQR <b>2,</b> 8) days of hospital-free survival. Conclusion: Reported MCIDs for outcomes after OHCA vary according to the outcome considered as well as the baseline rate of achieving it. MCIDs of ICU-free survival or hospital-free survival may be useful to accelerate the rate of evidence-based change in resuscitation care. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{describe}} {{the phenomenon of}} delayed-onset neurologic deficit after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and to discuss management {{of this type of}} deficit in a case series. Methods: Since September 1992 we have used cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion routinely {{to reduce the risk of}} neurologic deficit in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm patients. All patent intercostal arteries were reattached when this was technically feasible. Delayed neurologic complications occurred in eight patients who underwent operation for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm between September 1992 and March 1997, between 1 and 14 days after awakening from anesthesia. All patients had immediate cerebrospinal fluid drainage on recognition of their symptoms. Results: Patients were evaluated by an independent neurologist and were classified by a modified Tarlov score between 0 and 5. All eight patients improved at least two points by discharge. The mean change in Tarlov score from onset to <b>discharge</b> was <b>2.</b> <b>4</b> ± 1. 1 (p = 0. 008). Conclusions: Cerebrospinal fluid drainage significantly improved late-onset neurologic deficit that occurred between 1 day and 2 weeks after operation in our series. Immediate drainage should be considered when signs of neurologic deficit first begin to appear. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 26 : 616 - 22. ...|$|R
40|$|Greywater {{consists}} of household wastewater excluding <b>toilet</b> <b>discharges.</b> Three systems were compared for the biological treatment of greywater {{at a similar}} hydraulic retention time of approximately 12 – 13 hours. These systems were aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor, anaerobic treatment in an up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor and combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment (up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor + sequencing batch reactor). Aerobic conditions resulted in a COD removal of 90 %, which {{was significantly higher than}} 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment. The low removal in the anaerobic reactor may have been caused by high concentration of anionic surfactants in the influent (43. 5 mg/L) and a poor removal of the colloidal fraction of the COD in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Combined aerobic-anaerobic treatment accomplished a COD removal of 89 %, similar to the aerobic treatment alone. Greywater methanization was 32 % for the anaerobic system and 25 % for the anaerobic-aerobic system, yielding a small amount of energy. Therefore, anaerobic pre-treatment is not feasible and an aerobic system is preferred for the treatment of greywate...|$|R

To elucidate the molecular basis that underlies the diversity of P <b>4.</b> <b>2,</b> the gene structures of bovine P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 76 and P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 75 were investigated. Two P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> cDNA clones were isolated from bone-marrow cDNAs of the animal with the P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> (76 / 75) phenotype. These were identical in size (2. 2 kb), encoding major erythroid P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> with 687 amino acids, but were different in three nucleotides, resulting in changes of amino acids at the 599 th, 601 st and 627 th residues. Analysis of genomic DNA from the three phenotypes demonstrated that these two clones were derived from gene transcripts by which P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 76 and/or P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 75 were produced. In vitro transcription and translation of P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 76 and P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 75 cDNAs indeed generated P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 76 and P <b>4.</b> <b>2</b> / 75 identical in size to the red-cell proteins.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} climate model simulations of a split {{of the polar}} jet stream during the late Pleistocene, we hypothesize that (1) 20 - 13. 5 ka BP, season-toseason variation in the latitudinal maximum of the jet stream core led to enhanced wetness in the Great Basin, and (2) after 13. 5 ka BP, northward movement of the jet stream resulted in increased aridity similar to today. We suggest that the enhanced effective wetness was due to increased precipitation combined with an energylimited reduction in evaporation rates that was caused by increased summer cloud cover. A physically based thermal evaporation model was used to simulate evaporation for Lake Lahontan under various hypothesized paleoclimates. The simulated evaporation rates, together with hypothetical rates of precipitation and discharge, were input to a water balance model of Lake Lahontan. A 42 % reduction in evaporation rate, combined with maximum historical rates of precipitation (1. 8 times the mean annual rate) and <b>discharge</b> (<b>2.</b> <b>4</b> times the mean annual rate), were sufficient to maintain Lake Lahontan at its 20 - 15 ka BP level.
