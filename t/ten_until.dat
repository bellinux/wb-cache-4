25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a five-place grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but slid in turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top <b>ten</b> <b>until</b> a tear-off visor wrapped itself around one of his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an engine component. His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one lap on soft compound tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|E
500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gibbons [...] produced five more novels, as well as two poetry collections, a children's book, and a number of short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the Holly Lodge Estate off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons regularly worked in the mornings from <b>ten</b> <b>until</b> lunchtime. [...] Her novels were generally well received by critics and the public, though none earned the accolades or attention that had been given to Cold Comfort Farm; [...] readers of The Times were specifically warned not to expect Gibbons's second novel, [...] Bassett (1934), to be a repetition of the earlier masterpiece. Enbury Heath (1935) is a relatively faithful account of her childhood and early adult life with, according to Oliver, [...] "only the thinnest veil of fictional gauze cover raw experience". Miss Linsey and Pa (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her analysis of women writers from 1914 to 1939, to parody Radclyffe Hall's [...] 1928 lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness. Gibbons's final prewar novels were [...] Nightingale Wood (1935)—"Cinderella brought right up to date"—and My American (1939), which Oliver considers her most escapist novel, [...] "a variant of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen." ...|$|E
500|$|Their {{grandmother}} {{preferred to}} raise them simply, and they made their own clothes. A new governess from Switzerland, Madame Gelieux, was appointed, giving the children lessons in French; as was common for royal and aristocratic children of the time, Louise became fluent and literate in the language, while neglecting her own native German. She received religious instruction from a clergyman of the Lutheran Church. Complementary to her lessons was an emphasis on charitable acts, and Louise would often accompany her governess when visiting the houses {{of the poor and}} needy. Louise was encouraged to give out as much as was in her means, although she often got into trouble with her grandmother for donating too much for charity. From the age of <b>ten</b> <b>until</b> her marriage at 17, Louise spent most of her time in the presence of her grandmother and governess, both well-educated and refined. When only nine years old, Louise was present when the poet Friedrich Schiller read from the first act of [...] "Don Carlos" [...] for the entertainment of the assembled court, thus sparking her love for German as a literary language, especially works of Schiller. Louise loved history and poetry, and not only enjoyed reading Schiller, but also came to like the works of Goethe, Paul, Herder and Shakespeare, as well as ancient Greek tragedies.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the author}} Raymond Benson, Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's {{previous}} work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond [...] "becomes something more than... cardboard figure" [...] {{that he had been}} in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as [...] "Elastic office hours from around <b>ten</b> <b>until</b> six,... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends,... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women." [...] This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing [...] "a sourness" [...] in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling—illegal except in private members clubs in 1955—and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption [...] "meant relaxation, ritual and reliability". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.|$|E

2500|$|To {{help display}} its many prizes, {{the show has}} {{featured}} several models who were known, during Barker's time on the show, as [...] "Barker's Beauties". Some longer-tenured Barker's Beauties included Kathleen Bradley (1990–2000), Holly Hallstrom (1977–1995), Dian Parkinson (1975–1993), and Janice Pennington (1972–2000). Pennington and Bradley were both dismissed from the program in 2000, allegedly because they had given testimony on Hallstrom's behalf in the wrongful termination litigation she pursued against Barker and the show. Following the departures of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar and Claudia Jordan in the 2000s, producers decided to use a rotating cast of models (up to <b>ten)</b> <b>until</b> the middle of season 37, after which the show reverted to five regular models. Since March 2008, the models include Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster and Gwendolyn Osbourne; Manuela Arbeláez joined the cast in April 2009, replacing Brandi Sherwood and James O'Halloran joined the cast in December 2014. Carey does not use a collective name for the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models {{will be able to}} use the show as a [...] "springboard" [...] to further their careers. In a change from previous policy, the models appearing on a given episode are named individually in the show's credits and are formally referred as [...] "The Price Is Right models" [...] when collectively grouped at events. Since season 37, the show often uses a guest model for certain prizes, often crossing over from another CBS property or come courtesy of the company providing the prize. Some such models have been male, especially for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and used in guest appearances during the Showcase. Owing to the traditionally female demographic of daytime television shows, along with the pregnancies of Reynolds and Osbourne, CBS announced that the game show would add a male model for a week during season 41, fitting with other countries with the franchise that have used an occasional male model. The show held an internet search for the man in an online competition that featured Mike Richards, the show's executive producer, Reynolds, Lancaster, Osbourne and Arbeláez serving as judges and mentors during the web series, narrated by Gray. Viewers selected the winner in October 2012. On October 5, 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Rob Wilson of Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson appeared as a model on episodes through April 15, 2014. This contest was scheduled to be repeated in 2014, with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014. On December 8, 2014, CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O'Halloran.|$|E
