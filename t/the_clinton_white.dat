5|$|In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican {{and flat}} tax {{advocate}} Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

[...] The magazine The American Spectator, {{which had}} a well-established animus towards the First Couple, focused on the Travelgate story as one of many [...] Clinton-related matters it thought scandalous, describing it as [...] "a story about influence-peddling and sleazy deal-making... in <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House".

500|$|In his own estimation, the Arizona {{senator is}} {{straightforward}} and direct, but impatient. Other traits include {{a penchant for}} lucky charms, a fondness for hiking, {{and a sense of}} humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: [...] "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly?â€“ Because Janet Reno is her father." [...] McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House accepted his apology. McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him. [...] He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the [...] "Three Amigos".|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 2000, Gore {{announced}} that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became [...] "the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second-highest office." [...] Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House. Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Laura Callahan {{resigned}} from the United States Department Of Homeland Security after it was learned that she had received her doctorate from the unaccredited Hamilton University (not {{to be confused with}} the fully accredited Hamilton College in Clinton, New York).

2500|$|Sessions {{also served}} as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee during the {{nomination}} process for Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens.

Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E

5000|$|Trailer parks, {{especially}} in American culture, are stereotypically viewed as lower income housing {{the occupants of}} which live at or below the poverty line, have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives, as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser James Carville who, {{in the course of}} one of <b>the</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House political scandals, suggested [...] "Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find," [...] in reference to Paula Jones.

During the general election campaign, Perry refused to debate White until White released his tax returns from 1995, his last year as deputy energy secretary in <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration. <b>White</b> released his tax returns for his six years as mayor of Houston. According to his spokesperson, White had taxes withheld from his $133,000 salary in 1995, the amount of which was offset by losses in the starting of an energy business.|$|R

2500|$|William Gould's term as NLRB chair {{ended on}} August 27, 1998. Two days later, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House asked Truesdale {{to return to}} the NLRB as chair. [...] "I was very {{conflicted}} about it," [...] Truesdale later said. [...] "But I worked for the NLRB for almost 50 years. How can you say no?" [...] The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House {{press office}} issued a {{response}} to McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] article by arguing that it contained [...] "numerous factual inaccuracies and misleading statements."

[...] Supporters of the Clinton plan questioned McCaughey's claims, including her statements that [...] "the law will prevent you from going outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better" [...] and that [...] "doctor can be paid only by the plan, not by you" [...] by pointing to the text of the legislation such as Section 1003: [...] "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting...

2500|$|The First Lady's role in {{the secret}} {{proceedings}} of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit {{in relation to the}} Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires openness in government. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House argued that the [...] in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.|$|E
5000|$|WCRW was a [...] "shared time" [...] AM {{radio station}} in Chicago, Illinois; sharing its {{frequency}} with two other stations, (WEDC and WSBC), each broadcasting a part of <b>the</b> day. <b>Clinton</b> <b>White,</b> a radio engineer, started the station in 1926; it initially operated on 720 kHz from studios at Waveland and Pine Grove on Chicago's north side. White and his wife, Josephine, worked at their station as a team, with both sharing the on-air duties. Josephine {{claimed to be the}} first female disk jockey. While the Whites entertained friends and neighbors with their radio station, this programming was not able to pay the station's operating expenses.

While White sought new sources of funding in London, Humphrey circulated in the Puritan circle of his brother-in-law <b>the</b> Earl of <b>Clinton.</b> <b>White</b> succeeded in interesting new investors, under whose auspices the Massachusetts Bay Company was established in 1628. The company acquired {{a grant from the}} Plymouth Council for New England for land roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers.

A number of Clinton's associates, notably John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, Richard Bellingham, and Simon Bradstreet, were also drawn to the idea of migration to North America.
