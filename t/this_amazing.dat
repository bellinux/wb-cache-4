5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
25|$|The biology behind <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> {{ability is}} that when one trigger hair is stimulated, it {{actually}} causes all four large motor neurons to become active. These large motor neurons are fully covered in a glial sheath which {{is a group of}} specialized cells that nourish and support neurons. A glial sheath is essential for sending signals at a fast rate, because it allows for a single smooth road rather than having the signal jump from neuron to neuron.|$|E

25|$|At Indian Wells, {{she became}} the No.33 seed after Elena Dementieva withdrew. She {{made the most of}} her luck, {{stunning}} everyone by making the semifinals of the Tier I event, her first-ever semifinal at this level. In the fourth round, she stunned No. 10 seed Ana Ivanovic, and beat No.13 seed Tatiana Golovin in the quarterfinals. Unfortunately, her fairytale came to an end in the semifinals losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova, the second seed, with a result of 7–6, 4–6, 1–6. Due to <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> run, she rose to a new career high of No.30.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just {{a quarter of an}} hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). <b>This</b> <b>amazing</b> effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E

Why, {{the business of}} Venus, Erotium replies coyly. Messenio whispers to his master that the lady undoubtedly is a schemer for his money, and asks her if she knows his master. He is Menaechmus, of course, replies Erotium. <b>This</b> <b>amazes</b> the twin, but Messenio explains that spies of the city's thieves probably have learned his name.|$|R
500|$|In mid-2009 Vogg stated: [...] "It {{has been}} {{the hardest thing for}} me to move on without Vitek by my side, but he would have wanted me to {{continue}} with the band.

500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> mind, she has <b>this</b> <b>amazing,</b> you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
60|$|Now Umslopogaas was {{by nature}} a {{fighting}} man, one {{who took a}} positive joy in battle, and like an old Norseman, {{seemed to think that}} thus only could a man decorously die. <b>This</b> <b>amazed</b> me, a peaceful person who loves quiet and a home. Still, I gave way, partly to please him, partly because I hoped that we might discover something of interest, and still more because, having once undertaken an enterprise, my pride prompted me to see it through.|$|R

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] {{was directed by}} Rich Lee and filmed in early May 2011. During the video shoot, Derulo spoke to MTV News about the video's concept, saying, [...] "Basically, [...] not {{about going to the}} club, [...] never leaving the club. [...] these creatures who can't get enough of <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> party. But it's not a club – it's a warehouse and we live here." [...] On May 23, 2011, a 30-second teaser of the music video was released online, showing Derulo dancing with former Pussycat Dolls member, Melody Thornton. The video premiered on MTV on May 25, 2011.|$|E

After watching the preview, a staff member of Idolator commented that it [...] "reminds us of our own family Turkey Day get-togethers: there are people running around in ridiculous attire, someone’s crying and the hostess is a (Mother) Monster of sorts." [...] In a three-minute teaser trailer, Gaga makes crafts and shares holiday food with third-grade children. The full TV special premiered on November 24, 2011, at 9:30pmET.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Parklife (1994) revived Blur's {{commercial}} fortunes. The album's first single, the disco-influenced [...] "Girls & Boys", found favour on BBC Radio 1 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 59 in the US Billboard Hot 100 where {{it remains the}} band's highest-charting single. Parklife entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks. Enthusiastically greeted by the music press—the NME called it [...] "a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [...] "—Parklife is {{regarded as one of}} Britpop's defining records. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for Parklife. Coxon later pointed to Parklife as the moment when [...] " [...] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> new pop sensation".|$|E
60|$|To do him justice, he kept {{still as}} a log of wood, and so, {{yielding}} partly to the stream, I landed him somewhat further down than the place where my own clothes were lying. To them he walked, and very quietly picking up my whinger and my raiment that he gathered under his arm, he concealed himself in a thick bush, albeit it was leafless, where no man could {{have been aware of}} him. <b>This</b> <b>amazed</b> me not a little, for modesty did not seem any part of his nature.|$|R

500|$|Voss {{and the six}} {{remaining}} British aces swirled down to 600meters (2,000feet). At times, Voss had {{the altitude}} advantage over his foes, but {{did not try to}} escape the fight. Using the triplane's superior rate of climb and its ability to slip turn, Voss managed to evade his opponents and return to battle. He continued to flick turn at high speeds and attack those behind him. As Bowman later noted concerning his only shot at Voss: [...] "'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his nose up slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> stunt appeared to have any effect on the controllability of his machine." [...] Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight.|$|E
500|$|In Crunchyroll's inaugural The Anime Awards, {{which are}} based on an online popular vote, Yuri on Ice {{received}} awards in all of its seven nomination categories: Best Boy (Yuri K.), Best Animation, Most Heartwarming Scene ("The Kiss", episode seven), Best Couple (Yuri K. and Victor), Best Opening, Best Closing, and Anime of the Year. Although some Crunchyroll users complained that the show won awards it did not deserve, notably the award for Best Animation, and accused fans of Yuri on Ice of rigging the vote, others defended the awards, writing that there was no conclusive evidence to prove this, while Crunchyroll stated on Twitter that they had used strong anti-cheating methods. Kun Gao, the general manager and founder of Crunchyroll, wrote [...] "We are thrilled that Yuri!!! on Ice has both captivated passionate anime fans and introduced new viewers to anime, and we are privileged to {{have had the opportunity to}} distribute <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> property to its many viewers outside Japan".|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido, in a 2012 {{review for}} Tor.com, gave the episode {{a score of}} 7 out of 10. He said that the {{majority}} of the guest cast were [...] "pretty nowhere", but that the backbone of the episode was Lenard portraying Sarek, [...] "one of the most beloved recurring roles in the franchise's history, and this episode is a beautiful illustration of why". He called the telepathy plot [...] "dopey sci-fi stuff", but praised the direction of Landau in—among others—the concert scene, which he called a [...] "tour de force". He said, however, that the standout part of the episode was the interaction of Stewart and Lenard, who he referred to as [...] "two great actors at the absolute top of their game". He said that [...] "Stewart simply owns the mind-meld, a turbulent, raw scene that leaves the character of Sarek completely exposed, and Stewart sells it amazingly. At that point, the plot contrivances are forgotten, as you realize that the whole episode was worth it to watch <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> scene".|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{after a few}} failed attempts; Aphrodisiac {{manages to}} get the Crystal Ball to signal again by {{consuming}} some fireflies, and he helps Nymphomania and Little Dick to reunite, whilst also curing the King's impotence. She also casts acrobatic spells on Little Dick, which causes him to grow erections that reach extreme lengths. <b>This</b> <b>amazes</b> the circus crowd, and an obese female circus participant - Miss Lulu Lashers, a tightrope walker - runs after the little dwarf, so she can have sex with him. To prevent this from happening; Nymphomania races to rescue Little Dick, followed by Aphrodisiac with the Crystal Ball.|$|R
60|$|And another {{consideration}} stayed me. She {{seemed to}} love the King. Young and lacking in wisdom, <b>this</b> <b>amazed</b> me. In age he compared favourably with her husband he was but thirteen years older than herself--but in nothing else. He was a weedy, unhealthy-looking man, weakly of frame, rachitic, undersized, with spindle-shanks, and a countenance that was almost grotesque, with its protruding jaw, gaping mouth, great, doglike eyes, and yellow tuft of beard. A great king, perhaps, this Philip, having so been born; but a ridiculous man and an unspeakable lover. And yet this incomparable woman seemed to love him.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 1394, {{a group of}} {{indigenous}} people came from the Pacific coast. They {{wanted to get to}} Tenochtitlan in order to attend the crowning of the emperor. On their way to their destination, these Pacific people established in Ixtapan de la Sal where they formed communities. Here they noticed that once the geothermally heated water was evaporated naturally in the sunlight, salt was formed. <b>This</b> <b>amazed</b> them because back then, salt was a very precious item. When the emperor found out about this discovery, he also ordered men and women to move there, which led to the foundation of Ixtapan de la Sal.|$|R
500|$|Zahir was {{surprised}} and angered by Ismail's reticence to attack. In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including Quneitra, while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Bani Nu'aym tribe in Hauran, also part of Damascus. In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under Abu al-Dhahab in May. Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa, the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of Sidon from Darwish Pasha. However, Abu al-Dhahab was persuaded by Ismail that confronting the Ottoman sultan, who carried a high religious authority as the caliph of Islam, was [...] "truly... a scheme of the Devil" [...] and a crime against their religion. A short time after capturing Damascus, Abu al-Dhahab and Ismail subsequently withdrew from the city, whose inhabitants were [...] "completely astonished at <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> event", according to a chronicler of the time period. The sudden turn of events compelled Zahir's forces to withdraw from Sidon on 20 June.|$|E
500|$|... "Watch n' Learn" [...] {{was written}} by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The {{production}} of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> [...] Priscilla Renea, and I {{was going to tell}} her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here and see if you could come up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it. [...] Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011).|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just <b>this</b> <b>amazing</b> emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

This is the first provable, direct {{evidence of what}} has happened to at least 11,000 human beings who have been tortured and executed and apparently disposed of. <b>This</b> is <b>amazing.</b> <b>This</b> is the type of evidence a prosecutor looks for and hopes for. We have pictures, with numbers that marry up with papers with identical numbers - official government documents. We have the person who took those pictures.

5000|$|They {{then headed}} back east, not going {{directly}} to Kharta but climbing {{a considerable number of}} mountains over 20000 ft during which Bryant had no altitude problems and had [...] "never felt fitter". Counting over the entire expedition, they had climbed 26 peaks over 20000 ft (24 of them climbed for the first time) and Bryant had climbed 10 (8 for the first time). Beyond Kharta, on the trek back to Sikkim they reach a rope bridge where, for a bet, Bryant swam across the torrent. <b>This</b> <b>amazed</b> the Sherpas who, although very adept at wading (even when carrying the Europeans on their backs), had never seen or heard of anyone swimming.|$|R
