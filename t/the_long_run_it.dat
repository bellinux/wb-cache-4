5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff {{and a key}} {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had wide experience as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> <b>it</b> was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} long-term adjustment, the United States promoted European and Japanese trade competitiveness. Policies {{for economic}} {{controls on the}} defeated former Axis countries were scrapped. Aid to Europe and Japan was designed to rebuild productivity and export capacity. In <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> was expected that such European and Japanese recovery would benefit the United States by widening markets for U.S. exports, and providing locations for U.S. capital expansion.|$|E
25|$|Partnerships {{present the}} {{involved}} parties with complex negotiation and special challenges {{that must be}} navigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and succession, how success is evaluated and distributed, and often {{a variety of other}} factors must all be negotiated. Once agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by civil law, especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up Articles of Partnership. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance and clear communication are critical success factors in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run.</b> <b>It</b> is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.|$|E

Jackson in 1952, during early {{deliberations}} that led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: [...] "I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed." [...] Rehnquist continued, [...] "To the argument ... that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities are."

500|$|Wałęsa {{has been}} criticized for a confrontational style and for instigating [...] "war at the top", whereby former Solidarity allies clashed with one another, causing annual changes of government. This {{increasingly}} isolated Wałęsa on the political scene. As he lost political allies, he came to be surrounded by people who were viewed by the public as incompetent and disreputable. Mudslinging during election campaigns tarnished his reputation. Some thought Wałęsa, an ex-electrician with no higher education, was too plain-spoken and too undignified for the post of president. Others thought him too erratic in his views or complained he was too authoritarian and that he sought to strengthen his own power {{at the expense of the}} Sejm. Wałęsa's national security advisor Jacek Merkel credited the shortcomings of Wałęsa's presidency to his inability to comprehend the office of the president as an institution. He was an effective union leader capable of articulating what the workers felt but as president he had difficulty delegating power or navigating bureaucracy. Wałęsa's problems were compounded by the difficult transition to a market economy; in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> was seen as highly successful but it lost Wałęsa's government much popular support.|$|E
500|$|During {{the dispute}} with Taylor over the High National Council in December, Khánh {{had tried to}} frame the dispute in {{nationalist}} terms, {{in an attempt to}} rally support around himself against what he saw as overbearing US influence. This worked for a while, as Taylor had angrily berated Khánh's generals, but in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> failed, as South Vietnam and the generals' careers and advancement were dependent on US aid. Taylor hoped Khánh's appeals to nationalism might backfire by causing his colleagues to fear a future without US funding. On occasions during the December stand-off, Khánh had appealed to his colleagues to support the expulsion of Taylor from the country. The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Khánh said the military did not need US aid. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding. After the December coup, Taylor credited the fear of US abandonment for having [...] "raised the courage level of the other generals to the point of sacking him", as many were seen as beholden to their desire for personal advancement above all.|$|E

Although based on a specific example, the evidence supports more general conclusions: when assessing the regional redistributive and risk-sharing power of national fiscal policies, many different factors related to the existing policy regime should be accounted for, particularly the distribution of government spending between current expenditure and public investment...|$|R

She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What {{are we going to}} do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was an examination of the band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run.</b> <b>It</b> comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Students began {{arriving}} in Zap on Friday, May 9, 1969. They quickly filled the town's two taverns. The demand for beer {{was such that}} the tavern owners decided to double the price.

Vomiting and urinating on the streets by the students caused great concern among the locals, who quickly began to fear for their safety. The temperatures fell below freezing and the drunken college students started a bonfire in the center of town, using wood that was left over from a recent demolition project. The townspeople, led by Mayor Fuchs, asked the students to leave: most complied but some did not. What had started out as a spring break get-together quickly turned into the only riot in North Dakota's history. Local security forces were overwhelmed and the cafe and one of the bars were completely destroyed.|$|E

If he has no such sympathy, and if his desires leading to bad actions are at the time strong, and when recalled are not overmastered by the persistent social instincts, then he is essentially a bad man;[122] and the sole restraining motive left is the fear of punishment, and the conviction that in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> {{would be best for}} his own selfish interests to regard the good of others rather than his own.|$|E
