5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against early in <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>process,</b> {{for a number}} of reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be {{adequate}} in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>process</b> and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>process</b> for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult {{than it would have been}} for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E
5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights gameâhe felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time. Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.|$|E

Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
