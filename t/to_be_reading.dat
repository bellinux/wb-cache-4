25|$|After singing The Star-Spangled Banner, {{while the}} {{opposing}} team is being introduced, members of the student section take out {{a copy of the}} student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> it in an effort to show lack of interest in {{the opposing team}}. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.|$|E

25|$|Schorr {{attracted}} {{the anger of}} Richard Nixon's White House. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.|$|E
500|$|Connelly gained public {{recognition}} with Jim Henson's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie, {{in which}} she played Sarah, a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby {{from the world of}} goblins. Although a disappointment at the box office, the film later became a cult classic. The New York Times, while noting the importance of her part, panned her portrayal: [...] "Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing. ... She looks right, but she lacks conviction and seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it." [...] Two years later, she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film Étoile, and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman's Some Girls.|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

500|$|The band {{contacted}} local Toronto artist Oli Goldsmith {{who happened}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> the same book, {{to create the}} artwork for the upcoming album. In total, he made around 200 paintings relating to the project, {{many of which were}} used for the album art, promotional singles and the band's website. Based on the success of that commission, the record label asked him to also create and direct music videos for the singles [...] "In Repair" [...] and [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which took his paintings and brought them to life with animation and stylized live motion. His artwork was described as [...] "Integrating photographs, logos, television images, signs, as well as a variety of written forms, such as epigrams and poetry, Goldsmith's art juxtaposes the unexpected, resulting in pieces that are bold, colourful, and energetic." [...] When the album insert is unfolded, it reveals a surrealistic panorama that appears to be set in a hospital. The official photo shoot for Spiritual Machines took place on October 7, 2000 on the sixth floor of St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto, formerly an intensive-care unit.|$|E

The police officers who first responded, recognizing that Lennon's wounds were severe, decided not to wait for an ambulance and rushed him to Roosevelt Hospital in a squad car. Chapman was arrested without incident. In his statement to police three hours later, Chapman stated, [...] "I’m sure the big part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil." [...] Lennon was pronounced dead by Dr. Stephan Lynn at 11:07p.m. at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929, Beckett {{published}} his first work, a critical essay entitled [...] "Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce". The essay defends Joyce's work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett's contribution to Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by Eugene Jolas, Robert McAlmon, and William Carlos Williams). Beckett's {{close relationship with}} Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce's daughter Lucia owing to her progressing schizophrenia. Beckett's first short story, [...] "Assumption", was published in Jolas's periodical transition. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem [...] "Whoroscope", which draws on a biography of René Descartes that Beckett happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> when he was encouraged to submit.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} during November 2009 that the band were now working with producer Ross Robinson, with Robinson confirming through his Twitter account. The band stated {{that work with}} Ford had gone astray, reaching difficulties with Ford acting as both producer and drummer. Klaxons broke from recording {{at the end of}} the year to perform at Get Loaded In the Dark at Brixton Academy on 31 December 2009, featuring alongside Chase & Status and Annie Mac. Recording was completed to the satisfaction of both band and label in February 2010. The following month, it was confirmed that the band would be playing Open'er Festival in Poland as well as the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK. They headlined the BBC Radio 1/NME Stage. Taylor-Davies suggested Reading and Leeds would be a UK-exclusive, saying, [...] "I think in England it's just going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Reading</b> and Leeds, in terms of festivals, this summer".|$|E
2500|$|Kushner's {{criticism}} of Israel's {{treatment of the}} Palestinians and of the increased religious extremism in Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy with U.S. Jews, including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of Brandeis University. [...] The Zionist Organization of America unsuccessfully lobbied the university to rescind its invitation to Kushner. During the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner {{said at the time}} that his quotes were [...] "grossly mischaracterized." [...] Kushner told the Jewish Advocate in an interview, [...] "All that anybody seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reading</b> is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am." [...] In an interview with the Jewish Independent, Kushner commented, [...] "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a one-state solution, which is not true." [...] However, he later stated that he hopes that [...] "there might be a merging of the two countries because [...] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map," [...] although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.|$|E
