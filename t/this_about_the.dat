500|$|Wanting {{to have a}} {{new style}} of music, Gaga made it clear she did not want her fans to like the song. She wanted to write a song that could define where she was with Born This Way and her life. In an {{interview}} with NME, Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: [...] "This song is about me going back to New York. I wrote <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> courage it took for me to say 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".|$|E
500|$|Drake has {{described}} the song as [...] "eerie" [...] and [...] "dark", and as [...] "simplistic" [...] having a [...] "reverb-driven harmony." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News said <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song: [...] "Trey Songz's hook expresses the dreams of a young black male coming from nothing to something, and Drake's raps put the hip-hop nation on notice, while conveying his own desperation and hope and revealing family struggles. Let's not forget Lil Wayne's magnificent at bat as cleanup hitter..." [...] An [...] "endearing and revealing" [...] moment happens in the record when Drake refers to an incident when his mother contemplated leaving home during family troubles.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 2003, about 20 {{percent of the}} {{population}} of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis: they are often referred to as [...] "Sushis".

In both instances the United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring <b>this</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook.

2500|$|Maiorescu himself {{suggested}} that Pogor's Bucklean discovery facilitated Junimisms transformation into a socio-political movement. Other such influences came from Schopenhauer, and from John Stuart Mill's Subjection of Women. Buckle influenced the main Junimist historical narratives, from Maiorescu's historical lectures to A. D. Xenopol's own History of Civilizations. Pogor's own belief, namely that Romania was essentially peripheral to European civilization, was not readily welcomed {{by the national}} conservative faction at Junimea. A glimpse of this is provided by a maverick Junimist, George Panu, as a purported clash between Pogor and the autochthonist Eminescu. According to Panu, Pogor openly ridiculed national historians: [...] "What's all <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of the Romanians? Can't you see {{that we have no}} history? A people which has no literature, art, or past civilization—such a people is not worth the attention of historians... At a time when France could produce Molière and Racine the Romanians were in a state of utter barbarism." [...] Eminescu retorted, promptly and (Panu notes) violently: [...] "What you call barbarism, I call the settled wisdom of a people that develops in conformity with its own genius and shuns any mixing with foreigners" [...] (alternatively translated as: [...] "the wisdom of a nation, which progresses according to the rhythm of its own genius, away from any foreign interference").|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, {{he moved}} to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, {{influenced}} by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied {{in the works of}} Richard Wagner and the French racist Arthur de Gobineau. In his book Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, the aristocratic snob Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends. Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst {{what was left of the}} [...] "Aryan race", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans. The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer wrote that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely [...] "redemptive anti-semitism", a type of völkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of [...] "redemption" [...] for the anti-Semitic. Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow-despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year {{he moved to}} Germany and became an important member of the [...] "Bayreuth Circle" [...] of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the Master's message of racial hatred. Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness. In another letter, Chamberlain stated <b>this</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the Wagner cult:If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning-that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its [...] "pristine holy worth"-then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our being forever. In Chamberlain's viewpoint, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult.|$|E
