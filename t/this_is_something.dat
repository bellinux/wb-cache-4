5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E

5|$|Smaller squares do exist, {{including}} Dortmund Square, St Peters Square, Queen Square, Woodhouse Square and Hanover Square. While {{the rest}} of Leeds has large open parks, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> the city centre lacks and most free recreational space is contained within these squares. Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping. In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Teebo (Voiced by Eric Peterson then James Cranna) - Wicket's {{best friend}} and the older child of Warok and Batcheela. Fascinated by tales of sorcery and magic becomes his Master Logray's Apprentice. He {{is a bit of}} a dreamer, and {{sometimes}} a little clumsy. Teebo often lacks discipline, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> he learns to master over time from Logray, and eventually becomes a respectful young Ewok. Has ochre fur and he wears a tan, baggy hood with a feather.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that a Muslim {{gynecologist}} {{can tell}} you {{if you need to}} or not… There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman.|$|E

25|$|During his {{period as}} Minister of Finance, Sassoon founded all the {{financial}} and budgeting structures and laws for the Kingdom and looked whole-heartedly after {{the interests of the}} monarchy and the proper fulfilment of its laws. Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of Iraqi dinars for the State. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that the Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|E
25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that is usually not found in written language.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|A second album, Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks: The Original Soundtrack of Dreamcast, {{composed}} by Ishiwatari and arranged by Koichi Seiyama, {{was released on}} January 17, 2001. It was well received by critics, with perfect scores from GoldfishX and Z-Freak of Square Enix Music Online. According to Goldfishx, [...] "Even if you're skeptical about hard rock, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that everyone should experience in their lifetime. It's rare to have this type of heart-pounding sound without some form of vocals, but it's even rarer that the compositions reach this overall level of greatness." [...] Z-Freak wrote, [...] "Unless you totally hate hard rock, you [...] have this CD" [...] and David Smith of IGN said that its music would either be loved or hated.|$|E
