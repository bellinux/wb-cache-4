5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives.</b> Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|On the Droits de l'Homme, many {{survivors}} {{were too}} weak to reach the boats, {{and a number of}} men fell from the hull and drowned in the attempt. Many more could not find room in the small boats, and only 150 men were rescued on 17January. The following morning, when the boats returned, they found only 140survivors left, at least as many again having died during the night. The last two people to leave the ship were the commanders General Humbert and Commodore Lacrosse. Taken to Brest, the survivors were fed and clothed and given medical treatment. All the surviving prisoners from the Cumberland were released and returned to Britain, in recognition of their efforts <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> from the shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Since 1987, Gates {{has been}} {{included}} in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2009, he held the title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from 2014–July 2017, with an estimated net worth of US$89.9billion as of October 2017. However, on July 27, 2017, and since October 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of US$93.9billion. In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.|$|E

25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some would argue that military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others would argue that the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E
25|$|GIS {{offers a}} {{superior}} method for landslide analysis {{because it allows}} one to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively. Because so many variables are involved, {{it is important to}} be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth's surface. Researchers need to know which variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location. Using GIS, extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives,</b> property, and money.|$|E

He would later (e.g. in June 1919) defend the decision <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and money by offering Germany an armistice once she was clearly beaten, although with hindsight this allowed the myth to grow up that Germany had not really been defeated.

25|$|During {{the early}} years of World War II, Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz were in the United States on a fund raising mission. As the war broke out, their only option to ensure the {{longevity}} of the Yeshiva was to transfer the whole yeshiva to American soil. In October 1940, a group of students led by Rabbi Chaim Stein escaped from war-ravaged Lithuania as it was overrun by the Nazis. This daring flight took place on the Sabbath. While travel is ordinarily prohibited on the Sabbath, one must transgress this prohibition in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives</b> and escape great peril. The original faculty, their families and most of the student body who chose to be left behind in Europe, were killed in Lithuania by Nazi forces and Lithuanian collaborators.|$|E
25|$|Peter Medawar was a {{zoologist}} turned clinician, {{who specialized}} in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives.</b> Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions. Medawar then set out {{in search of the}} reason why rabbits rejected non-self grafts.|$|E

25|$|The 9/11 Commission Report {{noted that}} lack of {{preparedness}} could {{have led to the}} deaths of first responders {{at the scene of the}} attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years. The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>lives.</b> Giuliani testified to the Commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33 million no-bid contract with Motorola, and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter's calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old analog radios from 1993. A book later published by Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission, argued that the Commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with Giuliani.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, the {{scientist}} Nicholas E. Scott-Samuel and colleagues presented evidence using moving patterns {{on a computer}} that human perception of speed is distorted by dazzle patterns.
