Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests. By October, all <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia.

40|$|Abstract. At present, {{by using}} {{qualitative}} methods, many scholars studied their motivation mechanisms and analyzed their motivation factor and processes {{from the perspective}} of behavior and psychology, but attempts to consider the interaction among <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff,</b> between <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enterprises have been very few. So, this paper establishes an evolutionary game models for studying motivation mechanisms of <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff</b> under <b>the</b> assumptions that the enterprises <b>and</b> <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff</b> all have bounded rationality. By using replicator dynamics equations, this paper analyses the strategy choice on the interaction between <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enterprises, among <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff,</b> <b>and</b> furthermore, discusses <b>the</b> evolutionary stability strategies of <b>the</b> R&D <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enterprises...|$|R

5|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{departure}} of those assistants, reports began to surface that O'Brien had interviewed for the Houston Texans' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak, who was fired late in the season. Subsequently, the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract, and on January 3, 2014, the Texans {{held a press conference}} announcing O'Brien as their new head coach. Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon, safeties coach Anthony Midget, defensive coordinator John Butler, running backs coach Charles London, and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6, and most were expected to follow O'Brien to the NFL, leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter, who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State, defensive line coach Larry Johnson, a long-time member of <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> <b>and</b> tight ends coach John Strollo, as assistant coaches on <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> <b>and</b> thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach, as he could bring in his own staff.|$|E

From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commanding officer of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at RAAF Station East Sale, Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its Avro Lincoln bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over East Gippsland, reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone. Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948, and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commanding officer of a re-formed No.10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World WarII. In its new guise the squadron was established from <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in Townsville. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland, and preparing No.10 Squadron for search-and-rescue operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln Mk 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.|$|E

40|$|Time {{management}} techniques say that it's better {{to keep track}} of tasks using a reminder system rather than your memory.
