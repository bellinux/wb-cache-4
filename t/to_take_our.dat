The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.|$|E

I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> time with the next album." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{practice}} of military deception predates Russia. The Art of War, written in 5th century BC and {{attributed to the}} ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tsu, describes a strategy of deception: [...] "I will force the enemy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness". Early in Russia's history, in the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, Prince Dmitry Donskoy defeated the armies of the Mongol Golden Horde using a surprise attack from a regiment hidden in forest. The tactics of that battle are still cited in Russian cadet schools.|$|E
500|$|McCain finally {{formally}} {{announced his}} candidacy on September 27, 1999 before {{a thousand people}} in Greeley Park in Nashua, New Hampshire, saying [...] "It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am {{a candidate for president}} to the United States." [...] He further said he was staging [...] "a fight <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve."

Commenting on the occasion, a security official said: [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> relationship with China to the next level".|$|E

As sponsor of the North American Monster Ball Tour, Virgin Mobile {{customers}} had access to presale tickets. Bob Stohrer, VP of Marketing for Virgin Mobile USA said [...] "We are excited <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> partnership with Lady Gaga and The Monster Ball Tour to another level. [...] We'll also build on our partnership around combating youth homelessness and continue to enhance the tour experience for fans and our customers." [...] Shows in {{the first leg of}} the tour were sold-out completely, prompting Live Nation Inc. to announce that Gaga will return to the U.S. in February 2011 for another run of U.S. dates. The 2011 dates for the North American Monster Ball Tour were announced as starting from February 19 in Atlantic City, with ten arena dates confirmed through April 18. Additional shows were announced, and Semi Precious Weapons collaborated with Gaga until the tour ended. Live Nation Entertainment's global touring division, headed by chairman Arthur Fogel, held the reins as promoter/producer of the Monster Ball tour.|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens who have come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater {{would lead to a}} nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E

Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare. Requiring funding, Castro toured the U.S. in search of wealthy sympathizers, there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a failed assassination attempt against him. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE), founded by José Antonio Echeverría. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.|$|E

He {{sent a letter to}} the press, declaring that he was [...] "leaving Cuba because all doors of peaceful struggle have been closed to me.

500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's {{one of the reasons we}} look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stukas, however, had {{numerous}} successes against Allied naval vessels {{and in particular}} the Royal Navy which posed a formidable threat to German naval and coastal operations. The heavy cruiser Suffolk was attacked on 17 April. Her stern was virtually destroyed but she limped back to Scapa Flow with 33 dead and 38 wounded crewmen. The light cruiser squadron consisting of the sister ships Curacoa and Curlew were subjected to lengthy attacks which badly damaged the former for one Ju 87 lost. A witness later said, [...] "they threatened <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> masthead with them in every screaming nerve-racking dive". The same fate nearly befell the sloop Black Swan. On the 27 April a bomb passed through the quarter deck, a wardroom, a water tank and 4-inch (10.2cm) magazine and out through the hull to explode in the fjord. The muffled explosion limited the damage to her hull. Black Swan fired 1,000 rounds but failed to shoot any of her attackers down. [...] was sunk on 30 April. The French large destroyer Bison was sunk along with [...] by Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 on 3 May 1940 during the evacuation from Namsos. Bisons forward magazine was hit, killing 108 of the crew. Afridi, which attempted to rescue Bisons survivors, was sunk with the loss of 63 sailors. 49 officers and men, 13 soldiers and 33 survivors from Bison were lost aboard Afridi. All ships were targeted. Armed trawlers were used under the German air umbrella in attempt to provide smaller targets. Such craft were not armoured or armed. The Ju 87's demonstrated this on 30 April when they sank the Jardine (452 tons) and Warwickshire (466 tons). On 15 May the Polish troopship Chrobry (11,442 tons) was sunk.|$|E
