5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, two {{problems}} were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized.

25|$|In logic, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> on David Hilbert's list of open {{problems}} {{presented in}} 1900 was {{to prove that}} the axioms of arithmetic are consistent. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible – at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's tenth problem was to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved that this could not be done.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> {{is due to}} food {{composition}} and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat.

25|$|Two {{problems}} ensue {{from the}} multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit.

With the labor and technological problems resolved, silver mining flourished.

25|$|These systems had {{two primary}} {{problems}} {{in terms of}} accuracy. The first {{was that there were}} several steps that had to be carried out in sequence in order to set up the bombsight correctly, and there was limited time to do all of this during the bomb run. As a result, the accuracy of the wind measurement was always limited, and errors in setting the equipment or making the calculations were common. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was that the sight was attached to the aircraft, and thus moved about during maneuvers, during which time the bombsight would not point at the target. As the aircraft had to maneuver {{in order to make the}} proper approach, this limited the time allowed to accurately make corrections. This combination of issues demanded a long bomb run.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot. He tried to solve the first problem by buying an engine built by the recently founded Miller company of Turin; the engine wasn't expensive and the Trentine engineer was glad to use an Italian-built piece of technology, because of his irredentist sentiments; however, the four-cylinder W engine proved quite unreliable and was apparently unable to run smoothly {{for more than a}} few minutes at a time. As far as <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>problem</b> was concerned, Caproni decided to have Ugo Tabacchi, a Veronese-born Trentine chaffeur who had recently joined Caproni's team, pilot the maiden flight of his aircraft.
