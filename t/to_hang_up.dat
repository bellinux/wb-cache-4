5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for {{the damage to the}} chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E

25|$|Hayes and the company's {{marketing}} manager Glenn Sirkis approached Heatherington with an outline {{for a new}} command-driven external modem. A few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started, but the real problem was somehow sending a command <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up,</b> while the modem was already connected.

25|$|On August 23, 2008 Josh White, {{writing in}} the Washington Post, {{reported}} the paper had received 3,000 pages of documents arising from the NCIS investigation through Freedom of Information Act requests.

The report said the deaths occurred in Camp 1, a camp for compliant captives, which had since been closed.

25|$|In late October 2010, Sarah Palin {{announced}} on Fox News Channel that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring {{to make up}} stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof. It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> a phone after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail. During the conversation, they laughingly considered twittering about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there. The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the remarks were taken out of context, but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.|$|E

25|$|Manobos {{occupied}} hinterland areas we {{now call}} Davao. Originally, they either wrapped the corpse in mat and bamboo slats <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> on the tree or laid the dead on an elevated station (such as platform) beside the trees. Placing the body on an elevated place was believed to help the dead’s soul reach the heaven. However, after the Americans introducing Abaca plantation system in the 20th century, the custom changed to burying the corpse under the house. Due to the plantation, it became impossible to simply move out from their places like how they did before. For Ata-Manobos occupying the forest areas of Davao, have the unique superstition in teaching Antuk (riddles) other than for wake ceremony will bring misfortune. So in Ata-manobos’ joyful wake custom, close people of the deceased gather and sit around the corpse (in laid down position) and chat, tell stories, sing, dance, play instruments and more to elevate the atmosphere of grief.|$|E

The expansion team Red Bull picked unprotected players from the dispersal draft, which includes himself and got his rights. To avoid leaving Ginebra and playing for Red Bull, he announced his retirement and decided <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> his jersey that year. His early retirement ended a long distinguished career that started in 1984 as an amateur guest player in the PBA. He also became the third PBA player after Ramon Fernandez and Bogs Adornado {{to be given the}} honor of retiring the jersey number by a PBA team and was the first by two PBA teams, the San Miguel Beermen and the Barangay Ginebra Kings. Both franchises retired his number 8 jersey in honor of his legacy in the PBA. In the same year, he was named in the PBA 25 greatest players ever to play in the league's history after the PBA celebrated its 25th year as the first professional basketball league in Asia.|$|E
500|$|Doggett {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in Season 1, episode 5 and is initially is the main antagonist but becomes a protagonist in later seasons. In her debut episode, she unsuccessfully attempts <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> a cross in the prison chapel and expresses homophobic views. She conflicts with Alex Vause and Piper Chapman throughout the first season. In the second season, Doggett's storyline revolves around her friendships with Sam Healy and Carrie [...] "Big Boo" [...] Black. This friendship with Big Boo continues into the third season. Big Boo comforts Doggett when the latter is feeling remorse for her abortions and when she is raped by a correctional officer. The character Doggett has received mixed reviews from critics, though Manning's performance has received positive feedback.|$|E

60|$|If I had {{any money}} to spend I’d buy some and take them back <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> right <b>up.</b> Mr. Leverett says it would do them good—not the pictures, but the Bangor folks (though {{sometimes}} he seems <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> them <b>up</b> too). He thinks everything of the French, anyhow, and says we don’t make nearly enough of them. I couldn’t help telling him {{the other day that}} they certainly make enough of themselves. But it’s very interesting to hear him go on about the French, and it’s so much gain to me, since it’s about the same as what I came for. I talk to him as much as I dare about Boston, but I do feel as if this were right down wrong—a stolen pleasure.|$|R

500|$|The tour {{concluded}} with the November 22, 2009, show at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. [...] Fans came {{from far away}} and the show dominated {{the feel of the}} city that day. [...] The full album played was Springsteen's first, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which he wryly said [...] "was the miracle. This was the record that took everything from way below zero to ... one." [...] The performance of it was dedicated to his first manager and producer, Mike Appel, who was present in the audience, and featured quite rare renditions of [...] "Mary Queen of Arkansas" [...] and (the first ever with the E Street Band) [...] "The Angel". [...] Other rarities peppered the 34-song, nearly 3½-hour night, including Chuck Willis's [...] "(I Don't Want <b>to)</b> <b>Hang</b> <b>Up</b> My Rock and Roll Shoes" [...] and, to mark Steven Van Zandt's birthday, totally obscure outtake [...] "Restless Nights" [...] (supposedly Van Zandt's favorite Springsteen song) and a now-unusual second song from the current album, [...] "Surprise Surprise". [...] Near the end he said, [...] "So we're gonna say goodbye, but just for a little while ... a very little while ..." [...] The tour finished not with the emotional statement in song that some other Springsteen tours have in the 2000s, but instead with John Fogerty's [...] "Rockin' All Over the World".|$|E
2500|$|Another episode {{featured}} the Dalek singing trio (who {{were unable to}} complete any songs with the word [...] "Doctor" [...] in the lyrics without resorting to extermination).

2500|$|A clothespin is a {{fastener}} with a lever action used <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> clothes for drying, usually on a clothes line. Clothespins often come {{in many different}} designs.
