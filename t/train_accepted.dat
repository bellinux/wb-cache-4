40|$|How {{can they}} fail to {{understand}} that vice is only alluring when it is beautiful and hidden, when it wears the mask of virtue?”-Anton Chekhov, A Nervous Breakdown On March 21 st, the pale sun started its slow climb north, but spring would not come to St. Petersburg for months. The winter of 1908 had been especially cruel, and the city lay buried in snow, its pastel palaces whipped by polar wind and draped in early darkness. The Neva, a sheet of crumpled ice trapped between granite bands, stretched like a used carpet before the Winter Palace; not yet had the pistol-like reports, which signaled tale cracking and collision of escaping floes, been heard through its lofty windows. In her fine home {{in the center of}} town, Countess Marina de Hayden, who was to be married in one month, waited for the return of the sun and its promising warmth for, she wrote, her soul, too, was crushed by ice. Inexorably, the grim days passed. Her mind fixed only on her impetuous lover, Count Nicholas Yusupov, Marina drifted like a shade through the preparations for her lavish wedding to another man. Dutifully she admired her ivory satin gown with its long <b>train,</b> <b>accepted</b> gifts and invitations, and went about town with her fiancé, Coun...|$|E

If I know anything at all of human nature--and the if is no mere figure of speech, but stands for honest doubt--no series of benefits conferred, or even dangers shared, would have so rapidly confirmed our friendship as this quarrel avoided, this fundamental difference of taste and <b>training</b> <b>accepted</b> and condoned.|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{instance}} learning (MIL) {{can reduce}} the need for costly annotation in tasks such as semantic segmentation by weakening the required degree of supervision. We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment. Fully convolutional <b>training</b> <b>accepts</b> inputs of any size, does not need object proposal pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances. Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge.

Sinkewitz initially denied the allegation and called for his B sample to be tested. German television withdrew from covering the Tour in protest when his positive test came to light. On 31 July Sinkewitz subsequently retracted his denial and confessed to using a testosterone gel on his upper arms whilst <b>training.</b> <b>Accepting</b> the positive test result, Sinkewitz stated that: [...] "It was a big mistake and irresponsible toward my team, colleagues, the sponsor and the whole of cycling."
