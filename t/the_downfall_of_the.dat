5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to trigger <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minoan civilization. Some sites were {{abandoned}} or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Antioch (8 June 218) {{was fought}} between the Roman armies of the Emperor Macrinus and his rival Elagabalus, whose troops were {{commanded}} by General Gannys, probably {{a short distance}} from Antioch.

5|$|The medieval {{history of}} Tiruchirappalli {{begins with the}} reign of the Pallava king Mahendravarman I, who ruled over South India in the 6th century AD and {{constructed}} the rock-cut cave-temples within the Rockfort. Following <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pallavas in the 8th century, the city was conquered by the Medieval Cholas, who ruled until the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Bokassa also {{hunted down}} Banza's close associates, such as Joseph Kallot, Faustin Marigot and Polycarpe Gbaguili. Kallot and Marigot died {{in prison in}} June 1969 and April 1971, respectively. With the {{exception}} of Gbaguili, who remained in prison until <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bokassa regime on 20 September 1979, the other associates were released months after their arrest. Gbaguili served as a witness in Bokassa's criminal trials for treason, murder, cannibalism and embezzlement during the 1980s, explaining in detail the numerous crimes and human rights violations the former dictator had completed.|$|E
5|$|He {{supported}} the secretary Mariano Moreno within the Junta, and {{was moved to}} the distant city of San Juan when the Morenists were removed from government. He returned as a deputy for Córdoba in the Assembly of Year XIII constituent assembly, promoting many resolutions. Together with Carlos María de Alvear, he organized the strategy for <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royalist stronghold in Montevideo, a threat to Buenos Aires during the Argentine War of Independence. Despite the victory, he faced political conflicts with admiral William Brown and an economic crisis, and was exiled from the country.|$|E
25|$|In drama, Kong Shangren's Kunqu opera The Peach Blossom Fan, {{completed}} in 1699, portrayed <b>the</b> tragic <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ming dynasty in romantic terms.

The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after his death and mainly {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian monarchy, Caxias' reputation was initially overshadowed by that of Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval, but with time surpassed even Erval's renown. In 1925 his birthday was established as the Day of the Soldier, a day of honor for the Brazilian army. On 13 March 1962 he was officially designated the army's protectorits soldierly ideal and the most important figure in its tradition. Historians have regarded Caxias positively, several ranking him as the greatest of Brazil's military officers.|$|E
5|$|Philippe Dollinger {{associates}} <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hansa {{to a new}} {{alliance between}} Lübeck, Hamburg and Bremen, which outshadowed the older institution. He further sets the date of dissolution of the Hansa at 1630 and concludes that the Hansa was almost entirely forgotten {{by the end of}} the 18th century. Scholar Georg Friedrich Sartorius published the first monograph regarding the community in the early years of the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hungary {{was marked}} by the battle of Mohács (Hungary) where the royal army was annihilated by the Ottomans on August 29, 1526. Thereafter the noblemen's {{political}} factions engaged in conflict and elected two kings. One of them, John I Szapolyai (15261540) {{was supported by the}} lesser nobility, while Ferdinand I of Habsburg (15261564) was recognized mainly in the kingdom's western counties, but the Transylvanian Saxons also supported him. Seeking the assistance of the Ottomans, John I had to pay homage to the sultan at Mohács in 1529.|$|E
5|$|The {{new road}} also led {{indirectly}} to <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's public transportation system. Between 1925 and 1932, the Texas Interurban Railway, an electric commuter rail service that ran from Dallas to Denton, operated a station in Lewisville. Business {{leaders in the}} Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time, proudly citing the city's progressive citizenship. The area's low population density could not sustain the venture, however, and in 1932, the line {{went out of business}} and immediately halted service.|$|E

25|$|A {{prime example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline is the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. Robert Crawshay ('Iron King') {{can be seen}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main reasons for <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> Cyfarthfa. <b>The</b> Crawshays refused to modernise by {{replacing}} iron production with steel production, using the newly discovered Bessemer process. This led to <b>the</b> closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works in 1874, which caused economic hardship and unemployment in Merthyr.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from the war, Porto Alegre resumed his {{political}} career. He became an active advocate for {{the abolition of slavery}} and a patron in the fields of literature and science. His death came on 18 July 1875 while again serving in Parliament. He was highly esteemed until <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchy in 1889. Regarded as too closely associated with the fallen regime, Porto Alegre slipped into obscurity. His reputation was eventually rehabilitated to a certain degree by historians, some of whom consider him to be among Brazil's greatest military figures.|$|E
5|$|Warwick {{had been}} such an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power and popularity. Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on the spot where Warwick purportedly died.|$|E
5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the baby on a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E

Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry {{was no match for}} the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{considerations}} for sending troops to Yemen may {{have included the}} following: (1) impact of his support to the Algerian War of Independence from 1954–62; (2) Syria breaking up from Nasser's United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1961; (3) {{taking advantage of a}} breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the FLN in Algeria and primarily for his efforts to undermine the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), which caused <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi monarchy in 1958; (4) confronting imperialism, which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny; (5) guaranteeing dominance of the Red Sea from the Suez Canal to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait; (6) retribution against the Saudi royal family, whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.|$|E
5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe <b>the</b> <b>downfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Copán dynasty.|$|E
