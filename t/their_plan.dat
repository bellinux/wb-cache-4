5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> was too costly.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 March, the prisoners enacted <b>their</b> <b>plan.</b> Serious {{problems}} arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom. As originally intended, Marcinkus {{was one of the}} first ten to escape.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins {{assigned}} spiritual {{values to}} Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover {{each of these}} in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.|$|E

5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> {{for the defense}} of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E
5|$|At a {{party in}} the Great Northern to welcome the new investors, Benjamin and Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{secretly}} discuss <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> to burn the town's sawmill and buy the land cheaply. Leland begins sobbing hysterically when {{a piece of music}} begins, and Martell escorts him away. Meanwhile, Shelly waits at home with her gun, as Johnson arrives back.

5|$|Billy and Stu discuss <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> to kill Sidney {{and frame}} the murder spree on her father, {{whom they have}} taken hostage. The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive.

Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and assassinate him. However, a witness goes to the FBI and identifies Tony.|$|E
5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began {{to sit back}} in their own half inviting Liverpool to attack them. <b>Their</b> <b>plan</b> worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, but to no avail. Midfielders John Wark and Mølby {{tried to find a}} way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut {{discovered}} {{a photo of}} the light and began to research its history. Joel Severance, chairman of the harbor commission, wanted to build a 28-foot (8.5 meter) tall replica that would primarily function as a daymark and <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> was endorsed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the United States Coast Guard and both the town of Deep River and Middlesex County, Connecticut, but it was expected to be denied by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
5|$|Many senior officers, {{particularly}} the Catholic Generals Khiêm and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried what they {{viewed as a}} handing of power to the Buddhist leaders. They tried to remove Khánh in favor of Minh, and recruited many officers to their plot. Khiêm and Thieu sought out US Ambassador Maxwell Taylor for a private endorsement of <b>their</b> <b>plan,</b> but Taylor did not want any more changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{selected}} three individuals from this analysis {{in order to}} delve more deeply into the sociocultural and contextual factors that influenced <b>their</b> <b>planning.</b> To do this, we focused on the three participants in the USE project who {{were included in the}} previous analysis in order to begin exploring the effects of the project on their behaviors. For this analysis, we returned to the full interview transcript and in places where the respondent discussed <b>their</b> <b>planning,</b> which often took place throughout the interview, we identified other factors that influenced <b>their</b> <b>planning.</b> These sociocultural and contextual factors were then graphically overlaid on the decision chains identified in the previous analysis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In most {{practical}} situations, agents need to continuously improve or repair <b>their</b> <b>plans.</b> In a multiagent system agents {{also need to}} coordinate <b>their</b> <b>plans.</b> Consequently, we need methods such that agents in a multiagent system can construct, coordinate, and repair <b>their</b> <b>plans.</b> In this paper {{we focus on the}} problem of coordinating plans without exchanging explicit information on dependencies, or having to construct a global set of constraints. Our approach is to combine a propositional plan repair algorithm for each agent with a blackboard that auctions subgoals on behalf of the agents. Both the details of a first construction and some initial experimental results are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Stephen Báthory {{had decided}} to secure the Bishopric of Kraków for his nephew, but the Holy See did not appoint Andrew coadjutor bishop of the Kraków See, because he was still too young. The king wanted to invade Russia and sent Andrew to Rome to {{convince}} Pope Sixtus V to support his plan. Andrew left Poland on 22 March 1586. Samuel Zborowski's brothers (he had been executed on Stephen Báthory's orders), wanted to capture and murder Andrew, but <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> failed because of a flood. Andrew came to Rome on 24 July. He informed the pope about Stephen Báthory's plan, asking financial support from the Holy See against Russia.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{selected}} the code name Mincemeat {{from a list}} of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to cooperate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{had also}} been {{mandated}} to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave, which amounted to 315,000 in France and Belgium alone.

After resistance from the French committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on French territory, the Commission revised <b>their</b> <b>plan</b> and reduced the number of memorials, and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures.|$|E
