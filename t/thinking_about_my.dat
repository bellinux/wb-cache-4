LaBelle described the single as an [...] "anthem for women", in which she defined the term [...] "sexify" [...] as a way for women to [...] "make [...] feel comfortable and confident and happy and proud" [...] or help their men feel the same way. The chorus is accompanied by a [...] "summery two-step tune", and includes lyrics such as [...] "I gotta whole bunch of ways" [...] and [...] "He'll come home girl / If you know what I mean."

500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E

However, Gaye felt the success was something he [...] "didn't deserve" [...] and that he [...] "felt like a puppet – Berry's puppet, Anna's puppet...." [...] Gaye followed it up with [...] "Too Busy <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> <b>My</b> Baby" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is", which reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Marvin Gaye {{had fallen}} into a deep {{depression}} following the brain tumor diagnosis of his Motown singing partner Tammi Terrell, the failure of his marriage to Anna Gordy, a growing dependency on cocaine, troubles with the IRS, and struggles with Motown Records, the label he had signed with in 1961. At one point, Gaye attempted suicide at a Detroit apartment with a handgun, only to be saved from committing the act by Berry Gordy's father. During this time, Gaye began experiencing international success {{for the first time in}} his career following the release of [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and subsequent hit singles such as [...] "Too Busy <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> <b>My</b> Baby", [...] "Abraham, Martin & John" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". But Gaye was in no mood to celebrate: [...] "My success didn't seem real. I didn't deserve it. I knew I could have done more. I felt like a puppet—Berry's puppet, Anna's puppet.

2500|$|Hughes had a {{very poor}} {{relationship}} with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico {{for a brief period}} in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, [...] "I had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much." [...] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when I was {{learning}} to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E

[...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.

Taking up the project of what German philosopher Karl Jaspers calls 2 ̆ 2 philosophizing in communication, 2 ̆ 2 this exercise in thought reflects an emotive and scholarly movement that dances around a central notion of communication as possibility.
