25|$|With the {{beginning}} of Euro-American contact in Interior Alaska in the early 19th century, trade influences and influxes of new populations began to change life in the region. Land use patterns shifted from traditional indigenous uses to activities based on Euro-American economic and political systems. As Euro-American traders (merchants), miners, missionaries and explorers moved into the Tanana Valley, the traditional life ways of local Athabaskan groups were disrupted. Access to trade goods {{and the development of}} the fur trade not only affected traditional material culture, but also began to dramatically affect subsistence activities and settlement patterns. Similarly, the arrival of missionaries in the Alaskan Interior profoundly influenced traditional social organization. The introduction of mission schools for Native children and the doctrine of new religious beliefs contributed to an erosion of <b>traditional</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> and other traditional practices. After the Alaska Purchase in 1867, most of the Koyukon were converted by either Catholic or Protestant denominations, and by 1900 virtually all Alaskan Athabaskans were Christians at least by name if not entirely by practice. An influenza epidemic in 1920 claimed one-fourth of the Lower Tanana Athabaskan population of Nenana (Toghotili).|$|E

Turtles exhibited fidelity to foraging areas considerably smaller than anticipated, with activity space sizes (85 pvc) that were on average 186. 0 km 2 (± 206. 0 sd). To complement tracking data, I interviewed eight Aboriginal fishermen and local ecotourism operators and recorded their <b>traditional</b> and local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> concerning loggerhead turtle movements and habitat use.

[...] The weak powers given to Aboriginal people on wildlife advisory boards allow the state to maintain political authority over wildlife resources, while giving the appearance of a participatory consensus-building approach with Aboriginal hunters.

40|$|The Cook Inlet beluga whale, {{one of five}} Alaskan stocks, is genetically {{distinct}} and geographically isolated from other populations. Historically, Cook Inlet whales were hunted commercially, for sport, and for subsistence uses. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 ended commercial and sport hunting; in 1999, subsistence hunting voluntarily ended. In 2008, Cook Inlet beluga whales were listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act after annual aerial surveys indicated the population was not recovering as expected.

30|$|The central aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether in very remote rural areas of Mongolia where infrastructure and government support are deficient, livestock herders use <b>traditional</b> and local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> to predict and cope with winter disasters. The relevance of this topic was also underlined in the study by Middleton et al. (2015). To put into perspective the importance of local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> for herders in the two Bulgan counties of Bayan-Ölgii and Khovd provinces, we explored the livestock losses experienced during the 2009 / 10 dzud as well as the cumulated livestock losses during the years 2005 to 2010 and compared these to the post-dzud (2013) livestock possession of the interviewees. We could unfortunately not collect reliable data for the pre-dzud livestock possession of individual herders, but we might of course have applied the percentage loss of cattle, camels, goats, sheep and yak in Bulgan (National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2014) to each household, so as to reconstruct the 2009 herd sizes. Yet with this approach, we would have postulated that across all herds, the percent losses were the same, which certainly is not true; therefore, we abstained from this exercise.|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{are learning}} contexts {{of importance for}} generating, transferring, and updating <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> of natural environments through everyday work practices. The rich knowledge fishers have of local ecosystems {{is the result of}} the intimate relationship fishing communities have had with their natural environments across generations (see e. g. Urquhart and Acott 2013). This relationship develops strong emotional bonds to the physical and social place. For fishing communities and fishers – who depend directly on local ecosystems to maintain their livelihoods – fishing environments are natural places for living, working and defining themselves. Previous research on fishers’ <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> has mainly been descriptive, i. e., has focused on aspects such as reproduction, nutrition and spatial-temporal distribution and population dynamics, from a traditional view of knowledge that only recognises scientific knowledge as the true knowledge. By doing this, fishers’ <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> has been investigated separately from the learning contexts in which it is generated, ignoring the influence of social, cultural and historical aspects that characterise fishing communities, and the complex relationships between fishers and the natural environments they live and work in. This thesis investigates <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> among small-scale fishers living and working in the ecosystems of Lake Vättern and the Blekinge Archipelago (Baltic Sea) in Sweden and explores how <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> is generated with particular regard to the influences of work and nature on fishers’ knowledge of ecosystems. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of informal learning processes of ecosystem complexity among small-scale fishers. This knowledge further contributes to the research field of <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> and sustainable use and management of natural resources. It addresses the particular research questions of what <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> fishers generate, and how its generation is influenced by their fishing work practices and relationships to nature. The thesis consists of three articles. Article I focuses on the need to address the significant lack of theoretical and methodological frameworks for the investigation of the cognitive aspects involved in the generation of <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Article II deals with the need to develop theoretical, methodological and empirical frameworks that avoid romanticising and idealising users’ <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> in local (LEK), indigenous (IEK) and <b>traditional</b> (TEK) <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> research, by rethinking it as being generated through work practices. Article III addresses the lack of studies that explicitly explore theories linking complex relations and knowledge that humans form within and of ecosystems. It also addressed the lack of attention from environmental education researchers to theory and empirical studies of ‘sense of place’ research, with a particular focus on environmental learning. Research into the question of what <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> fishers generate shows differences in their ways of knowing ecosystem complexity. These differences are explained in terms of the influences of the species being fished, and the sociocultural contexts distinguishing fishers’ connection to the fishing profession (i. e., familial tradition or entrepreneurship) (Article I), but also by the fishing strategies used (Article II). Results answering the research question of how work practices influence fishers’ knowledge of ecosystem complexity show a way of rethinking their <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> as generated in a continuous process of work (Article II), thus, far from romantic views of knowledge. Results answering the research question of how fishers’ relationships to nature influence their knowledge of ecosystem complexity demonstrate the complex interconnections between psychological processes such as identity construction, proximity maintenance and attachment to natural environments (Article III). Finally, more similarities than differences between fishers’ knowledge were found, despite the variation in cases chosen, with regards to landscape, target species, regulations systems and management strategies, fishing environments scales, as well as cultural and social contexts.

40|$|The {{emergent}} human {{cultures have}} shaped, {{and in turn}} been shaped by, local ecosystems. Yet humanity' s intense modification of the environment has resulted in dramatic worldwide declines in natural and cultural capital. Social-ecological systems are becoming more vulnerable through the disruption of livelihoods, governance, institutions, resources and cultural traditions. This paper reviews the environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged to seek solutions for conservation and maintenance of the resilience of social-ecological systems. It shows that a central component is engagement with the knowledges of people within their contexts. Local knowledges of nature (<b>traditional,</b> indigenous, local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> and ecoliteracy) are used by place-based cultures to guide actions towards nature. The importance of new engagements between different knowledges is now becoming more widely recognized by scientific institutions. Yet there still exist many false dualisms (for example local knowledge versus science) which tend to emphasize a superiority of one over the other. Ecocultures retain or strive to regain their connections with the environment, and thus improve their own resilience.

40|$|The {{fields of}} ethnobiology and {{language}} documentation {{have much to}} offer each other, but for the moment, there are few signs of engagement between practitioners of the two disciplines. In this paper, I argue that projects that seek to document endangered languages can benefit {{by focusing on the}} semantic domain of <b>traditional</b> biological and <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> (TEK), and by engaging in collaborative projects with ethnobiologists. In do-ing so, researchers not only produce a rich corpus that is culturally relevant and valuable to the language community, but also record information about the natural world that may be of interest to researchers in other fields. The TEK encoded in a language is best and most easily observed in the specialized vocabulary that speakers may employ when talking about various natural phenomena. However, a community’s knowledge of their biological environment extends far beyond the lexicon and into the domain of complex ecological relationships among different organisms. Using examples from my fieldwork in southern India, I argue {{that it is possible to}} capture such knowledge in a language documentation program. Other criteria for a good documentation, such as the inclusion of a wide range of speech genres, can also be met while eliciting TEK from language consultants. 1. INTRODUCTION. Th...|$|R

However, the experiences {{in the wake of the}} 2009 / 10 dzud had increased herders’ appreciation of local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> across ethnic groups and wealth strata. Some herders (n[*]=[*] 18) stated that they became aware of the importance of local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> and related strategies after the last dzud, others (n[*]=[*] 14) confirmed that they rediscovered the significance of hay-making and hay-stocking and a third group (n[*]=[*] 11) had acquired basic skills of livestock management. Conversely, 26 respondents claimed not to engage in particular preventive actions against dzud, whereby there were no differences between male and female respondents (M 12, F 14) or between ethnic groups. Nevertheless, most herders (n[*]=[*] 40) stressed the importance of hay-making and hay-stocking to prepare for a dzud. Improving the animals’ winter pen, the wind-protection fences and reinforcing the manure layer on the pen floor were also mentioned as being important dzud preparation measures (n[*]=[*] 24). The respondents explained that about 1  m of dry animal manure needs to be piled up on the pen floor to protect the animals from the frozen terrain underneath. In addition, the pen floor needs to be cleaned every day and frozen urine patches have to be removed to keep the inside air warm. The fence around the pen and adjacent yard must be fixed and gaps filled with manure, wood or stones to keep off cold wind. These measures require dry manure from cattle and yak, stones and wood. Manure is difficult to obtain for many Sh and some Mh households, because of a limited number of cattle and lack of manpower for the related physical work. The acquisition of concentrate feed and nutritious forage was not viewed as a realistic coping strategy against dzud because of high costs. Nevertheless, all interviewees hoped to be supported in this way by the government in case of another harsh winter.|$|R

30|$|In {{many regions}} of the world, <b>traditional</b> and local <b>ecological</b> <b>knowledge</b> is still {{important}} today for coping with environmental challenges. This study explored the relevance of such knowledge for predicting and coping with harsh winter conditions (dzud) in a remote area of western Mongolia, where government support to disaster-affected herders is restricted by weak infrastructure. Structured face-to-face interviews were held in 50 households (HHs), addressing aspects of livestock possession and management as well as disaster prediction and mitigation. The responses disclosed that livestock losses during the 2009 / 10 dzud averaged 112.4 animals per HH, equaling nearly 80 % of the interviewees’ total livestock possession in summer 2013. To reduce such high losses in the future, herders planned to improve their hay-making efforts and winter pen preparation. However, they also stated that the earliest signs for a dzud occur in September, when it is already too late for substantial hay-making. Therefore, some herders underlined the necessity of maintaining livestock productivity through segregated summer grazing of specific animal groups, controlled mating and early sale of weak livestock. Animals are then entering a harsh winter in good body condition. National and international organizations wishing to support livestock keepers in this and similar regions should therefore highlight the relevance of local strategies for disaster prevention and support community-based approaches that can compensate for the prevalent lack of family labour.|$|R
30|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been adopted}} through the lifespan of the project described herein to determine and evaluate the effectiveness, appropriateness, value or success of the development model - rural extension of social services - and project interventions (specific programs and activities) introduced or trialled {{in the study area}} since 1998. A learning approach or mindset was adopted from the outset, in recognition of the fact that no one development approach or set of guidelines can be assumed a priori to be the best way forward for pastoral communities, in any given geo-political context, as such communities move into the twenty-first century - with its realities of modernization, of regional integration, even of globalization to the most distant regions of the planet. Mutual learning is necessary for the proper integration of traditional and modern approaches to animal husbandry and rangeland management, in order to develop better hybrid models of 'development' for herding communities. Such models should be based on pastoralists' wealth of experience, <b>traditional</b> <b>ecological</b> and other <b>knowledge,</b> and cultural preferences and aspirations, as well as on scientific findings and global experiences of development. For this reason, the authors have spent years learning about local views, perceptions, understandings, etc. through both formal and informal discussions, interviews with many stakeholders, focus groups, direct observation, and questionnaire surveys - in short, they have sought to learn much over the years simply by regularly 'drinking tea' (spending time) with local herders and other project partners.|$|R

Moreover, our complementary methods approach enabled a more spatially and temporally detailed account than either method would have afforded alone.
