5|$|Paulinus' missionary {{efforts are}} {{difficult}} to evaluate.

Although Osric, one of Edwin's successors, was converted <b>to</b> <b>Christianity</b> by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey.

It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht {{was the son}} of Eormenric, {{succeeding}} him as king, {{according to}} the Chronicle. He married Bertha, the Christian daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in contemporary Western Europe; the marriage probably took place before he came to the throne. Bertha's influence may have led to Pope Gregory I's decision to send Augustine as a missionary from Rome. Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in east Kent in 597. Shortly thereafter, Æthelberht converted <b>to</b> <b>Christianity,</b> churches were established, and wider-scale conversion <b>to</b> <b>Christianity</b> began in the kingdom. He provided the new church with land in Canterbury, thus establishing one of the foundation stones of what ultimately became the Anglican Communion.|$|E
