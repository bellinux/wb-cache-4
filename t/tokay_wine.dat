5000|$|Later {{the same}} day Fisk Junior {{encounters}} the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted {{to look beyond the}} Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial <b>Tokay</b> <b>wine,</b> which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather (Bryan Brown), an Australian [...] "conveyancer", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life — as a Welsh Spaniel. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer. There is a sub-plot concerning Fisk Senior's childhood that receives an unexpected resolution forming the climax of the story.|$|E

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetBotrytis {{bunch rot}} and blight of leaves, shoots and blossom clusters, also called gray mold, occurs {{throughout}} the viticultural world. The fungus causing the disease grows and reproduces on senescent or dead plant tissue. As a disease-causing organism, it {{is responsible for}} crop loss {{in a wide variety}} of unrelated crops. Botrytis bunch rot is especially severe in grape cultivars with tight, closely packed clusters of fruit. Botrytis is also responsible for storage losses of grapes picked for fresh market. In addition to its crop loss potential, Botrytis infection of ripe fruit of certain cultivars, combined with precise climatic conditions, results in a condition called “noble rot” and is the prized ingredient in the Auslese, Beerenauslese, and Trockenbeerenauslese wines of Germany, the Sauternes wines of France, and the <b>Tokay</b> <b>wines</b> of Hungary...|$|R
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and <b>Tokays).</b> Sweet <b>wines</b> often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|R
40|$|The aim of my Bachelor degree work is {{to point}} out to oxygen as a part of daily life of us [...] humans, wine and to the various aspects of oxygen effects during various {{winemaking}} processes. In the process of fermentation at white wines and in the process of maturing at red wines. The oxygen has got important role in negative wine oxydation, which the wine maker strives to restrain. Further, it is good to know how to prevent negative oxygen effects and how to make use of possitive attributes of oxydation. The methods of oxygen determination in wine have been mentioned too, though they are not use in practise. On the other hand, oxygen is necessary during winemaking process of oxidative types of <b>wines</b> such as <b>Tokay</b> selections, Port <b>wine</b> and sherry...|$|R
2500|$|The grape variety Pinot gris is {{believed}} to have been taken to Hungary in the 14th century, where it was named Szürkebarát. It is further believed to have been brought back to Alsace by General Lazarus von Schwendi after his campaign against the Turks in the 16th century. It was planted in Kientzheim under the name [...] "Tokay", taken from Hungary’s most famous wine Tokaji, which does not use Pinot gris. For a long time, the Alsatian wines produced from this variety were labelled Tokay d'Alsace. However, in 1993, an agreement was reached between Hungary and the European Union (of which Hungary was not yet a member) to phase out the name <b>Tokay</b> from non-Hungarian <b>wine.</b> In the case of Alsace, the name Tokay Pinot gris was used as an intermediate step, with the [...] "Tokay" [...] part eliminated in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{authentication}} of {{the wine}} originating with the 1540 vintage, some experts dispute the claims that this was oldest wine ever tasted due to the nearly 200 years of having [...] "newer" [...] wine being used to top up the barrel—making it almost similar to a solera style wine that contains partial amounts of several vintages. Other contenders {{for the title of}} [...] "oldest wine ever tasted" [...] include a 1646 bottle of <b>Tokay</b> that Australian <b>wine</b> expert James Halliday tasted with fellow writer Len Evans in the early 1970s when it was over 324 years old. Another bottle of wine from the 1646 vintage was sold for $700 in a 1984 wine auction in Geneva to a collector from Princeton, New Jersey when the wine was at least 338 years old though there are no details on when that bottle was consumed.|$|R
60|$|All this while, and in {{the midst}} of a clamour and {{confusion}} which would better have become a German tavern during a fair than the tent of a sovereign prince, the Archduke was waited upon with a minuteness of form and observance which showed how anxious he was to maintain rigidly the state and character to which his elevation had entitled him. He was served on the knee, and only by pages of noble blood, fed upon plate of silver, and drank his <b>Tokay</b> and Rhenish <b>wines</b> from a cup of gold. His ducal mantle was splendidly adorned with ermine, his coronet might have equalled in value a royal crown, and his feet, cased in velvet shoes (the length of which, peaks included, might be two feet), rested upon a footstool of solid silver. But it served partly to intimate the character of the man, that, although desirous to show attention to the Marquis of Montserrat, whom he had courteously placed at his right hand, he gave much more of his attention to his SPRUCH-SPRECHER--that is, his man of conversation, or SAYER-OF-SAYINGS--who stood behind the Duke's right shoulder.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Among several common drying systems {{used in the}} enological sector the dry-on-vine (DOV) method assumes {{particular}} importance because famous wines such as Sauternes, <b>Tokay</b> and Ice <b>Wines</b> are produced by grapes dried using this system. Knowledge about trends in mechanical properties and phenolic composition during on-vine grape drying is scarce. The objective of this current study is therefore to increase the knowledge on these aspects. RESULTS: Berry skin break energy (+ 0. 10 N) and berry skin thickness (+ 69 μm) values increase during grape dehydration, while the peduncle detach force decreases (- 0. 86 N). Large reductions in the anthocyanin content have also been observed (- 40 %), but their profile does not show significant changes. Seed hardness (- 7. 10 N,- 1. 40 mJ) decreases during the withering, and higher seed springiness has been observed. Seed proanthocyanidins (+ 2050 mg kg berry- 1) and flavanols vanillin assay (+ 670 mg kg berry- 1) increase progressively throughout the withering. In contrast, a distinct lowering of these substances in the skins was noted. CONCLUSION: Many modifications in the chemical-physical characteristics of berries of Mondeuse winegrapes throughout the DOV process were found. The mechanical characteristics of grapes, in particular the peduncle detachment force, are important parameters in assessing their suitability for the drying-on-plant process...|$|R
2500|$|Previously, the Pinot gris wines {{produced}} in Alsace were originally labeled Tokay d'Alsace. In the Middle Ages, the grape was popularized {{in the region}} by Hungarian traders who {{were introduced to the}} grape from Burgundy. During this time, Tokaji {{was one of the most}} popular and sought after wines on the market and the name was probably used to gain more prestige for the Alsatian wine. Pinot gris was believed to have been brought back to Alsace by General Lazarus von Schwendi after his campaign against the Turks in the 16th century. It was planted in Kientzheim under the name [...] "Tokay". However, the Pinot gris grape has no known genetic relations to the Furmint, Hárslevelű, Yellow Muscat and Orémus grapes that are traditionally used in Tokaji wine. In 1980, the European Economic Community passed regulations related to Protected designations of origin (PDOs), and when Hungary started negotiations for European Union membership, it became clear that the Tokay name would have to become a PDO for the Tokaj-Hegyalja region. Therefore, in 1993, an agreement was reached between the Hungary and the European Union to phase out the name <b>Tokay</b> from non-Hungarian <b>wine.</b> In the case of Alsace, Tokay Pinot Gris was adopted as an intermediate step, with the [...] "Tokay" [...] part to be eliminated in 2007. Many producers had implemented the change to plain Pinot Gris on their labels by the early 2000s, several years before the deadline.|$|R
