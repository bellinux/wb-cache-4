A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E

Cats with long tails were disliked and {{there was a}} custom of cutting their tails. It is speculated that this is the reason <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> cats in Japan with short tails nowadays, because natural {{selection}} has favored those with short tails.|$|E

Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E

Mac of Slant Magazine {{called it}} a [...] "perfectly {{acceptable}} album filler: innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp." [...] However, Mac noted that [...] "t wouldn't be particularly lamentable {{were it not for}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> better choices for the standard edition of the album that have been relegated to bonus tracks." [...] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times {{called it a}} [...] "dull ballad", while for Saeed Saeed of The National the song [...] "is the first of a few tracks that should have been cut," [...] criticizing its [...] "atmospheric keyboards" [...] for being [...] "sleep-inducing." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters named it one of the album's [...] "forgettable jams" [...] and a [...] "generic thump," [...] meanwhile Lydia Jenkins of The New Zealand Herald opined that [...] "Hold Tight" [...] has [...] "so little substance [...] it seems wrong to call it a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> women who feel the same way".|$|E

500|$|Days after announcing Raimi's departure, {{the studio}} {{announced}} that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot. Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> stories to tell and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters." ...|$|E

But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

Author Barbara Ehrenreich, {{in response to the}} dismantling of the occupations, stated that [...] "One of the appalling things here is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Democratic mayors involved in these crackdowns or in Bloomberg's case, someone who is seen as a liberal." ...|$|E

After the ADE 651 {{became the}} focus of controversy for its role in Iraq, concerns were raised in Pakistan about its employment as a bomb detector by the ASF. A senior official at Jinnah International Airport denied that the ADE 651 was being used, claiming that the ASF had designed the device in use there, but other ASF officials acknowledged that their device [...] "operated on the same principle as ADE-651." [...] Sources claim that Device similar to ADE is made in Pakistan and is in use by Pakistan army. Source also found that these devices are working and have helped in catching 46 guns in different locations at different times. Source also visited an army checkpost on Kohat Highway with a 9mm pistol which was successfully detected by Army Personal. On the other hand, Pakistani scientists rejected the scientific basis on which the device was claimed to work; Professor Shahid Zaidi of Karachi University told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn that [...] "there has to be an electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field for a device to work in such a manner. Furthermore static fields don’t move around the way it is being claimed by some. Also don’t forget <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> radio waves of different frequencies all around us. I just don’t see how this device would work."
