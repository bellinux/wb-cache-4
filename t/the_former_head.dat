5|$|On 1 January 1971, he was {{appointed}} {{as the head of}} the Press and Public Relations of Mexico City alongside Alfonso Martínez Domínguez. However, Buendía turned down the position in June following the massacre of student demonstrators. A year later, Buendía worked as an advisor to Guillermo Martínez Domínguez, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of Nacional Financiera, a bank of Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). In Nacional Financiera, Buendía befriended Gerardo Bueno Zirón, who shortly after being appointed as director of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) offered him a position as director of the institution's Press and Public Relations department in 1973. That year, Henrique González Casanova, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of the Political Science department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), invited Buendía to work as a part-time professor, a job that the journalist held until his death in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, three others, Julián Sancristóbal, Juan Alberto Perote and Francisco Álvarez, were {{implicated in}} the case. Sancristóbal had been the former {{director}} of state security, Perote <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of the Spanish secret service, while Álvarez had been head of the anti-terrorist squad. They all denied the accusations. The Monbar case was closed in October 2001, with Garzón declaring that, although suspicions remained about involvement of some of those accused, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together. Feuer was <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of {{the music}} department at low-budget Republic Pictures; Martin was a television executive. Having secured {{the rights to the}} farce Charley's Aunt, they produced it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show was a hit and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} as unused substitute, behind Martin Olsson, throughout Sweden's disappointing group stage at Euro 2016. Following Hamréns resignation and Janne Andersson's arrival later that summer, Augustinsson got bigger competition when Oscar Wendt re-joined the squad after conflicts with <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> coach. With Andersson's experimenting {{of the two}} veterans at the left-back position {{in the beginning of}} the World Cup qualification, Augustinsson opened possibilities to join the Sweden U21 squad, for which he still was eligible to play. Andersson however kept him in the senior squad and Augstinsson came to play the final 30 minutes against Bulgaria in the qualifier in October.|$|E
50|$|In August 2010, Wendy Winks and Carl Restivo, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>heads</b> of <b>the</b> Hollywood branch, formed The Rock School Scholarship Fund, a tax-deductible 501(c)3 {{charitable}} {{organization to}} provide instruments and tuition for deserving students of any rock music {{school in the}} United States.|$|R

5|$|In 1954, Krichell {{was honored}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) with the William J. Slocum Memorial Award. Named after <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> sportswriter of the New York Journal American and {{president}} of the BBWAA, the award honored his longevity in baseball. The final players Krichell signed were two bonus babies: infielder Tom Carroll from Notre Dame University and Frank Leja, an 18-year-old first baseman. Krichell advised the Yankees staff to sign Carroll for $30,000 ($ in 2010) and he thought Leja could be the next Gehrig, but both flopped. By the time he retired, he was the most experienced employee still working for the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States {{military}} agency {{responsible for}} those aspects of nuclear weapons remaining under military control after the Manhattan Project was succeeded by the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling of nuclear weapons, as well as supporting nuclear testing. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the United States Army, United States Navy and United States Air Force; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services. Major General Leslie R. Groves, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of the Manhattan Project, was its first chief.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{several members of the}} track and field team that {{lettered}} in other sports, particularly football. Mel Renfro is primarily known for being inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame but he also achieved a world record in the 440 yard relay in 1962 while running in the track and field program for Oregon. Jordan Kent, a former professional football player, was a rare three sport letterman in track, basketball, and football. The 2010 Doak Walker Award winner, LaMichael James, ran track during the football offseason. One of the first multi-sport athletes with the Oregon Ducks was <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> coach Bill Bowerman, who played football and ran track under Bill Hayward in both sports.|$|E

5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of the Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized {{the role of the}} U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Leeman Bennett, <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> {{coach of}} the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{developed}} {{the game in}} the United States, unlike their previous titles which had been developed in Japan. The concept for the game originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992, but actual development did not begin until after the release of Sonic & Knuckles in late 1994. The programming of the game began in April 1995 and total development spanned a period of six months. The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles: Yuji Naka (<b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of AM8) was selected to act as lead programmer and producer, while Naoto Ohshima and Takashi Iizuka undertook the roles of director and lead designer, respectively. According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people at the start of production, and gradually grew to 20 people once more programmers started to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} of the Drakengard series is split between multiple timelines. Events in those timelines are separate, {{but they can}} overlap. The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel. Drakengard 3 acts as the first game's prequel, but most of its events take place in separate timelines leading to different outcomes. In Drakengard 3, a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners, women gifted {{with the power to}} use magic through song, as instruments of humanity's destruction. In Drakengard, which succeeds the fifth version of Drakengard 3s events detailed in a supplementary novel, the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals. In Drakengard 2, the Watchers continue to use <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>head</b> of the cult to destroy the new seals, while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world. Nier is set in an alternative reality created by events stemming from Drakengards fifth ending: in this reality, our modern world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction. Nier: Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier, featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games.|$|E
