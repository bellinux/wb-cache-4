40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{modeling}} and simulation of processes in the distribution network of electric energy. For {{the scope of this}} paper, the simulation means the simulation of quality of electric energy with the main focus on voltage and harmonic frequencies of current in distribution network. The point of connection of distribution network to the traction network was chosen as the point where measurements were taken and simulation was done. Introduction part deals with AC and DC traction network. Then the article discusses the problem of modeling of different parts of the distribution network and traction network, such as: overhead line, contact line, Filtration Compensation Equipment, twelve-pulse rectifier, three-phase three-wire transformer, traction transformer and load of railway <b>tractive</b> <b>stock.</b> The mathematical model of each part was drawn-up leading in a complex model of DC traction network connected to the 22 kV distribution network and the complex model of the one-phase AC traction network to the 110 kV distribution network. Software Pspice was employed to obtain simulations of particular components. Results of those simulations were compared with experimental measurements which were taken at the railway lap of traction current converter plant Hoštka – Mělník (for DC traction network) and at the railway lap of the traction sub-station Bohatice (for AC traction network). Based on comparision of measured and simulated data of AC and DC traction network it could be concluded that current harmonic frequencies take similar values, particular diferences are discussed in the paper. Another conclusion is that measeured and simulated data do not meet limits for harmonic frequencies of current given by standards PNE 33 3430 and ČSN IEC 61 000 - 3 - 4. Limits for harmonic frequencies of voltage stated in the standard ČSN EN 50 160 ed. 2 are not exceeded...|$|R

Using two different regression techniques to check for robustness, we find evidence of a statistically significant cyclical correlation between stocks and bonds. On {{the basis of this}} finding, we then present a methodology to “deflate” a stock price index such that we can compare <b>stock</b> market <b>strength</b> over time. This is obtained by removing the effect of a changing discount rate—as measured by our regressions—on stock prices.

40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} work focuses on forecasting of performance {{evaluation of the}} tractive and non-tractive vehicles that will satisfy and meet the needs and requirements of the railway industry, which is constantly evolving. Methodology. Analysis of the technical condition of the existing fleet of rolling <b>stock</b> (<b>tractive</b> and non-tractive) of Ukrainian Railways shows a substantial reduction that occurs in connection with its moral and physical wear and tear, as well as insufficient and limited purchase of new units of the tractive and non-tractive rolling stock in the desired quantity. In this situation there is a necessity of search of the methods for determination of rolling stock technical characteristics. One of such urgent and effective measures is to conduct forecasting of the defining characteristics of the vehicles based on the processes of their reproduction in conditions of limited resources using a continuous exponential function. The function of {{the growth rate of}} the projected figure degree for the vehicle determines the logistic characteristic that with unlimited resources has the form of an exponent, and with low ones – that of a line. Findings. The data obtained according to the proposed method allowed determining the expected (future) value, that is the ratio of load to volume of the body for non-tractive rolling stock (gondola cars) and weight-to-power for <b>tractive</b> rolling <b>stock,</b> the degree of forecast reliability and the standard forecast error, which show high prediction accuracy for the completed procedure. As a result, this will allow estimating the required characteristics of vehicles in the forecast year with high accuracy. Originality. The concept of forecasting the characteristics of the vehicles for decision-making on the evaluation of their prospects was proposed. Practical value. The forecasting methodology will reliably determine the technical parameters of tractive and non-tractive rolling stock, which will meet the modern requirements of the railroading, including at the design stage and while upgrading the vehicles...|$|R
