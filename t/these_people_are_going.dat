The defence attorney asked for leniency, and stated that Nicole Redhead was prone to violent behaviour since she had seen her mother kill her father at a drinking party at the age of 9. The aftermath of which led to her being shuttled around through five foster homes, being sexually assaulted, before turning to drugs and working in the sex trade. However, the prosecution told the jury that Jaylene had suffered more than 30 injuries in the days prior to her death, including bites on her legs, swollen genitalia and kicks. She was sentenced to 12 years, which is what prosecution requested, of which she will have to spend 8 years and 8 months. The trial caused such an uproar in Canada that it was debated in the provincial legislature, and an inquest found 14 recommendations in order to prevent a tragedy like this from happening. The Office of the Children's Advocate of Manitoba was involved in the inquest and provided the Special Investigative Report. The panel lambasted the Native Women’s Transition Centre in Winnipeg, with Justice Larry Allen stating that [...] "There {{does not appear to be}} any point to sending drug/alcohol addicted mothers to supposed 'safe houses' if <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have free access to the community without making sure that their sobriety is tested".

As two young researchers, we are aware of our limited abilities to change the actual economic situation in Albania. However, our research is an indicator not only of our motivation towards understanding and promoting economic development in our country, but also of the overall potential Albania has to realize in order to fully integrate in the global markets. This paper will attempt to provide answers to the following issues:  Effects of globalization on Albanian economy  Foreign investments in an emerging market such as that of Albania and reasons why foreign investors should invest in Albania  Constraints with a negative impact on investment in Albania  Macroeconomic factors determining FDI in Albania  Benchmarks of Albanian economy and FDI on a regional level  Competitive approaches of Albanian Market The methodology that we will use in the content of this paper will include qualitative economic analyses, comparative analyses and quantitative data. We will attempt to build up an econometric model identifying the main macroeconomic factors that determine FDI in Albania. At the end, we will present our main findings, conclusions, and recommendations. ...|$|E

At five, down we go to the Argyll Hotel, and wait dinner. Broth--"nice broth"--fresh herrings, and fowl had been promised. At 5.50, I get the shovel and tongs and drum them at the stair-head till a response comes from below that the nice broth is at hand. I boast of my engineering, and Bough compares me to the Abbot of Arbroath who originated the Inchcape Bell. At last, in comes the tureen and the hand-maid lifts the cover. [...] "Rice soup!"

After this, we have another weary pause, and then herrings in a state of mash and potatoes like iron. [...] "Send the potatoes out to Prussia for grape-shot," [...] was the suggestion. I dined off broken herrings and dry bread. At last [...] "the supreme moment comes," [...] and the fowl in a lordly dish is carried in.

Then Bough, taking up knife and fork, turns the [...] "swarry" [...] over and over, shaking doubtfully his head. [...] "There's an aspect of quiet resistance about the beggar," [...] says he, [...] "that looks bad."

This distress comes from {{loss of the}} communities’ human capital which supports its economic well being. For example, the declining human capital implies lack of employees and consumers to support local business and lower populations that lead to consolidation of schools and services as well as increased per capita costs for these services. Population loss {{is caused by a}} variety of reasons, the most discussed being lack of economic opportunities for young <b>people</b> in <b>these</b> small and rural communities. This thesis sought to increase appreciation of the problem by focusing on a single county in Kansas, Wabaunsee County, and assessing the factors that influenced out-migration decisions of its youth. The hypothesis was that understanding these factors and their strength would provide local policy makers with the tools to intervene in the dimensions of the problem of out-migration long before it happens. The data was drawn from a survey of the population of high school students and covered their perspectives about their community and their future location plans. The total number of respondents to the survey was 172, and of these, only 12 percent totally agreed that at least one adult (not parent) has talked to them about opportunities that would encourage them to return home after their post high school or college education. Only about 10 percent totally agreed that there are opportunities in their community for young people to work with adults. These results provide an opportunity for policy makers to engage adults in the community to provide mentorship opportunities for the community’s young people. While the majority of the respondents indicated going to college, only 11 percent indicated that they would return to live and work in Wabaunsee County after graduation. An even lower percentage of respondents indicated retiring in Wabaunsee County when asked to “think way into the future” and indicate whether they would like to retire in the country. The results indicate that the most critical variables influencing respondents’ intent to return after their education included community connection, their age and the existence of a business connection in the county. For example, the relative risk ratio (RRR) for those with community connections was 35 times as high as those without any community connection in their intent to return after college. Similarly, those with business interest in Wabaunsee County with interest in coming back after college exhibited a RRR of 345. 15. Similar indicators were found for intentions to retire in Wabaunsee County. It is obvious that the community cannot keep all of its young people. Indeed, it does not want to keep all of them if <b>these</b> young <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to achieve their personal excellence. However, the community’s leadership can work with local businesses to provide the youth with clear and compelling connections to local and family businesses to increase their community connections. The results of this research indicate that these stronger ties would increase the likelihood that <b>these</b> young <b>people</b> would return. Their return, given the historical trends, would signify a break from the past and contribute to an arrest of the declining population and, hopefully, contribute to an alleviation of the challenges associated with declining population in these small communities...|$|R
