5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was shot, <b>the</b> crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money <b>to</b> guide <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used <b>to</b> coax <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> into co-operation. One scene required <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> suckle Chan's nipple. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|R
