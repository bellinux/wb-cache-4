60|$|Richard {{dismounted}} {{to gather}} some roses and jessamine for the Princess, and to collect {{some of the}} curious fossil echini, which he believed to be olives turned to stone by the Prophet Elijah, as a punishment to a churlish peasant who refused him a meal. He thought that such treasures would be a welcome addition to the store he was accumulating for the good old Grand Prior. He gave his horse <b>to</b> <b>Hob</b> Longbow, his only attendant except a young Sicilian lad. This same Longbow had stuck {{to him with a}} pertinacity that he could not shake off, and in truth had hitherto justified the Prince's prediction that he would be a brave and faithful fellow when his allegiance was no further disturbed by the proximity of the outlawed Montforts. There had been nothing to lead Richard to think he ought to indicate either him or Nick Dustifoot to the Prince as the persons who had been connected with Guy in Italy.|$|E
60|$|And the {{stimulus}} drove him on to continual calls <b>to</b> <b>Hob,</b> in Simon's default, to jousts with sword or spear, represented generally by staves; and when these {{could not be}} had, he was making arrows and practising with them, so as to become a terror to the wild ducks and other neighbours on the wolds, the great geese and strange birds that {{came in from the}} sea in the cold weather. When {{it was not possible to}} go far afield in the frosts and snows, he conned King Henry's portuary, trying to identify the written words with those he knew by heart, and sometimes trying to trace the shapes of the letters on the snow with a stick; visiting, too, the mountains and looking into the limpid grey waters of the lakes, striving hard to guess why, when the sea rose in tides, they were still. More than ever, too, did the starry skies fill him with contemplation and wonder, as he dwelt on the scraps alike of astronomy, astrology, and devotion which he had gathered from his oracle in the hermitage, and longed more and more for the time to return when he should again meet his teacher, his saint, and his King.|$|E
60|$|George Warrington, then, {{on coming}} to London, {{attended}} the theatrical performances at both houses, frequented the theatrical coffee-houses, {{and heard the}} opinions of the critics, and might be seen at the Bedford between the plays, or supping at the Cecil along with the wits and actors when the performances were over. Here he gradually became acquainted with the players and such of the writers and poets as were known to the public. The tough old Macklin, the frolicsome Foote, the vivacious Hippisley, the sprightly Mr. Garrick himself, might occasionally be seen at these houses of entertainment; and our gentleman, by his wit and modesty, as well, perhaps, as for the high character for wealth which he possessed, came to be very much liked in the coffee-house circles, and found that the actors would drink a bowl of punch with him, and the critics sup at his expense with great affability. To be on terms of intimacy with an author or an actor has been an object of delight to many a young man; actually <b>to</b> <b>hob</b> and nob with Bobadil or Henry the Fifth or Alexander the Great, to accept a pinch out of Aristarchus's own box, to put Juliet into her coach, or hand Monimia to her chair, are privileges which would delight most young men of a poetic turn; and no wonder George Warrington loved the theatre. Then he had the satisfaction of thinking that his mother only half approved of plays and playhouses, and of feasting on fruit forbidden at home. He gave more than one elegant entertainment to the players, and it was even said that one or two distinguished geniuses had condescended to borrow money of him.|$|E

6000|$|Elated {{with the}} idea of seeing life, Pen went into a hundred queer London haunts. He liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of men--so he beheld coalheavers in their tap-rooms; boxers in their inn-parlours; honest {{citizens}} disporting in the suburbs or on the river; and he would have liked <b>to</b> <b>hob</b> and nob with celebrated pickpockets, or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen, had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society. It was good to see the gravity with which Warrington listened to the Tutbury Pet or the Brighton Stunner at the Champion's Arms, and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the Fox-under-the-Hill. His acquaintance with the public-houses of the metropolis and its neighbourhood, and with the frequenters of their various parlours, was prodigious. He was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady, and welcome to the bar as to the clubroom. He liked their society, he said, better than that of his own class, whose manners annoyed him, and whose conversation bored him. [...] "In society," [...] he used to say, [...] "everybody is the same, wears the same dress, eats and drinks, and says the same things; one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another, one Miss at a ball exactly resembles another, whereas there's character here. I like to talk with the strongest man in England, or the man who can drink the most beer in England, or with that tremendous republican of a hatter, who thinks Thistlewood was the greatest character in history. I like better gin-and-water than claret. I like a sanded floor in Carnaby Market better than a chalked one in Mayfair. I prefer Snobs, I own it." [...] Indeed, this gentleman was a social republican; and it never entered his head while conversing with Jack and Tom that he was in any respect their better; although, perhaps, the deference which they paid him might secretly please him.|$|E
60|$|These four {{brothers}} were united by a close bond, the bond of that mutual admiration—or rather mutual hero-worship—which {{is so strong}} {{among the members of}} secluded families who have much ability and little culture. Even the extremes admired each other. Hob, who had as much poetry as the tongs, professed to find pleasure in Dand’s verses; Clem, who had no more religion than Claverhouse, nourished a heartfelt, at least an open-mouthed, admiration of Gib’s prayers; and Dandie followed with relish the rise of Clem’s fortunes. Indulgence followed hard on the heels of admiration. The laird, Clem, and Dand, who were Tories and patriots of the hottest quality, excused to themselves, with a certain bashfulness, the radical and revolutionary heresies of Gib. By another division of the family, the laird, Clem, and Gib, who were men exactly virtuous, swallowed the dose of Dand’s irregularities as a kind of clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of God affixed to bards, and distinctly probative of poetical genius. To appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was necessary to hear Clem, arrived upon one of his visits, and dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs and personalities of that great city of Glasgow where he lived and transacted business. The various personages, ministers of the church, municipal officers, mercantile big-wigs, whom he had occasion to introduce, were all alike denigrated, all served but as reflectors to cast back a flattering side-light on the house of Cauldstaneslap. The Provost, for whom Clem by exception entertained a measure of respect, he would liken <b>to</b> <b>Hob.</b> “He minds me o’ the laird there,” he would say. “He has some of Hob’s grand, whunstane sense, and the same way with him of steiking his mouth when he’s no very pleased.” And Hob, all unconscious, would draw down his upper lip and produce, as if for comparison, the formidable grimace referred to. The unsatisfactory incumbent of St. Enoch’s Kirk was thus briefly dismissed: “If he had but twa fingers o’ Gib’s, he would waken them up.” And Gib, honest man! would look down and secretly smile. Clem was a spy whom they had sent out into the world of men. He had come back with the good news that there was nobody to compare with the Four Black Brothers, no position that they would not adorn, no official {{that it would not be}} well they should replace, no interest of mankind, secular or spiritual, which would not immediately bloom under their supervision. The excuse of their folly is in two words: scarce the breadth of a hair divided them from the peasantry. The measure of their sense is this: that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely within the family, like some secret ancestral practice. To the world their serious faces were never deformed by the suspicion of any simper of self-contentment. Yet it was known. “They hae a guid pride o’ themsel’s!” was the word in the country-side.|$|E

This EGL- 46 - regulated program is specific <b>to</b> <b>HOB</b> and is distinct from a general ciliogenic pathway functioning in all ciliated neurons.

40|$|Vitamin D {{receptor}} (VDR) agonists supporting human osteoblast (hOB) differentiation in {{the absence}} of bone resorption are attractive agents in a bone regenerative setting. One potential candidate fulfilling these roles is 24, 25 -dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (24, 25 D). Over forty years ago it was reported that supraphysiological levels of 24, 25 D could stimulate intestinal calcium uptake and aid bone repair without causing bone calcium mobilisation. VDR agonists co-operate with certain growth factors <b>to</b> enhance <b>hOB</b> differentiation but whether 24, 25 D might act similarly in promoting cellular maturation has not been described. Given our discovery that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) co-operated with VDR agonists <b>to</b> enhance <b>hOB</b> maturation, we co-treated MG 63 hOBs with 24, 25 D and a phosphatase-resistant LPA analog. In isolation 24, 25 D inhibited proliferation and stimulated osteocalcin expression. When co-administered with the LPA analog there were synergistic increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). These are encouraging findings which may help realise the future application of 24, 25 D in promoting osseous repair...|$|R

40|$|Auction opening bid {{is one of}} {{the online}} auction {{features}} that can be manipulated to promote bidding activity. Oftentimes, auction sellers that expect high bidding volume set their opening bids low only to later realize a lower price premium in their auctions. The current study offers explanations to this phenomenon by approaching this situation in a more holistic way. It examines the impacts of auction opening bids on bidding behaviors. Auction data from eBay were collected and separated into two samples, including auctions with low and high opening bids (LOB and HOB auctions). We found that HOB auctions attracted more serious bidders as indicated by their commitment to stay longer in the auctions. We also found that some bidding strategies that were commonly considered undesirable by auction sellers produced positive price premium <b>to</b> <b>HOB</b> auctions but not to its counterparts. Theoretical and pragmatic implications are later offered in the study...|$|E
40|$|Transglutaminases (TGs) {{stabilize}} proteins by {{the formation}} of ??(??-glutamyl) lysine cross-links. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-linking of collagen I (COL I) by tissue transglutaminase (TG 2) causes an alteration in the morphology and rheological properties of the collagen fibers. Human osteoblasts (HOB) attach, spread, proliferate, differentiate and mineralize more rapidly on this cross-linked matrix compared to native collagen. When seeded on cross-linked COL I, HOB are more resistant {{to the loss of}} cell spreading by incubation with RGD containing peptides and with ?? 1, ?? 2 and ?? 1 integrin blocking antibodies. Following adhesion on cross-linked collagen, HOB show increased phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, and increased expression of ?? 1 and ?? 3 integrins. Addition of human bone morphogenetic protein <b>to</b> <b>HOB</b> seeded on TG 2 cross-linked COL I enhanced the expression of the differentiation marker bone alkaline phosphatase when compared to cross-linked collagen alone. In summary, the use of TG 2 -modified COL I provides a promising new scaffold for promoting bone healing...|$|E
