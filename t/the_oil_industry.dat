5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry,</b> {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, a Dallas company {{known as}} the General American Finance System, {{struggling}} through the Great Depression, began to finance drilling operations in the state using oil reserves as collateral. This allowed Dallas to establish itself as the financing center for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry.</b> The Great American Finance System eventually reorganized itself as the General American Oil Company of Texas, which became an oil producer {{in its own right}} and, decades later, was purchased by Phillips Petroleum.|$|E

Drake's invention is credited with giving birth to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Rockefeller, who had rarely sold shares, {{held over}} 25% of Standard's stock {{at the time}} of the breakup.

The companies' combined net worth rose fivefold and Rockefeller’s personal wealth jumped to $900 million.|$|E
5|$|The Pasadena–Baytown area, {{including}} Deer Park and La Porte, {{straddles the}} Houston Ship Channel {{and has since}} the world wars been defined by the heavy industry along its shores. The two towns have distinct histories with Baytown having become tied to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> earlier and Pasadena having a longer history tied to ranching and agriculture before petrochemicals came to dominate. But in modern times their fortunes have been closely tied by their cores of heavy industry.|$|E
5|$|The boom in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> {{also helped}} promote other {{industries}} {{in other areas}} of the state. Lumber production thrived as demand climbed for construction of railroads, refineries, and oil derricks, and, in 1907, Texas was the third largest lumber producer in the United States. Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry. Agriculture and ranching grew stronger as the rapidly expanding population created more demand for their produce.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> would {{ultimately}} {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry.</b> Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of}} the zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E

5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>industry</b> in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E
