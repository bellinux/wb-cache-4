Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue.

The PLC Council nearly kept the school at Strathfield permanently, but ultimately it was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first term 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, and the Lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school.

5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E

5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle on <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as {{the mistress of}} an influential patron of the theatre to have a pas inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a pas de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time Adam was unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas. This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), {{became part of the}} ballet's performance tradition.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> seeking {{to exclude the}} nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games.

5|$|Like Dewoitine, German {{designer}} Kurt Tank, {{the former}} technical {{director of the}} Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG, had been similarly hired in 1947 {{to work on a}} jet fighter project for Argentina.
