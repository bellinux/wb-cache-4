The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B.

The complicated and often protracted dynamics of infection and disease make clinical trials to test new <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> extremely complex.

Because macaque monkeys develop a disease very similar to humans, they have potential to provide important information in addition to small animal models. To assess the relative merits of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys as screens for <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines,</b> we compared the efficacy of bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination and the course of infection in both species. Unvaccinated rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys both developed progressive disease with high levels of C-reactive protein, M. tuberculosis-specific IgG, and extensive pathology including cavitation and caseous necrosis. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination protected cynomolgus almost completely toward the development of pathology, reflected in a striking 2 -log reduction in viable bacteria in the lungs compared with nonvaccinated animals. Rhesus, on the other hand, were not protected efficiently by the bacillus Calmette-Guérin. The vaccinated animals developed substantial pathology and had negligible reductions of colony-forming units in the lungs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the search}} for more potent and safer <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines,</b> CAF 01 was {{identified}} as a remarkable formulation. Based on cationic liposomes and including a synthetic mycobacterial glycolipid as TLR-independent immunomodulator, it induces strong and protective T helper- 1 and T helper- 17 adult murine responses to Ag 85 B-ESAT- 6, a major mycobacterial fusion protein. Here, we assessed whether these properties extend to early life and how CAF 01 mediates its adjuvant properties in vivo. METHODS/FINDINGS: Following adult or neonatal murine immunization, Ag 85 B-ESAT- 6 /CAF 01 similarly reduced the post-challenge bacterial growth of M. bovis BCG, whereas no protection was observed using Alum as control. This protection was mediated by the induction of similarly strong Th 1 and Th 17 responses in both age groups. Multifunctional Th 1 cells were already elicited after a single vaccine dose and persisted at high levels for at least 6 months even after neonatal priming. Unexpectedly, this potent adjuvanticity was not mediated by a massive targeting/activation of dendritic cells: in contrast, very few DCs in the draining lymph nodes were bearing the labeled antigen/adjuvant. The increased expression of the CD 40 and CD 86 activation markers was restricted to the minute portion of adjuvant-bearing DCs. However, vaccine-associated activated DCs were recovered several days after immunization. CONCLUSION: The potent adult and neonatal adjuvanticity of CAF 01 is associated in vivo with an exquisite but prolonged DC uptake and activation, fulfilling the preclinical requirements for novel <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> to be used in early life...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of adjuvants for vaccines {{has become an}} important area of research {{as the number of}} protein-based vaccines against infectious pathogens increases. Currently, {{there are a number of}} adjuvant-basedMycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> in clinical trials that have shown efficacy in animal models. Despite these novel adjuvants, there is still a need to design new and more versatile adjuvants that have minimal adverse side effects but produce robust long-lasting adaptive immune responses. To this end, we hypothesized that Bacillus subtilis spores may provide the appropriate innate signals that are required to generate such vaccine-mediated responses, which would be sufficient to reduce the mycobacterial burden after infection withM. tubercu-losis. In addition, we compared the response generated by B. subtilis spores to that generated by monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), which has been used extensively to test <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The well-characterized, 6 -kDa early secretory antigenic target of M. tuberculosis (ESAT- 6; Rv 3875) was used as a test antigen to determine the T cell activation potential of each adjuvant. Inocu-lated into mice, B. subtilis spores induced a strong proinflammatory response and Th 1 immunity, similar to MPL; however, un-like MPL formulated with dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) bromide, it failed to induce significant levels of interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A) and was unable to significantly reduce the mycobacterial burden after pulmonary infection withM. tuberculosis. Further analysis of the activity of MPL-DDA suggested that IL- 17 A was required for protective immunity. Taken together, the data emphasize the requirement for a network of cytokines that are essential for protective immunity.

40|$|We {{utilized}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging to visualize lesions in the lungs of guinea pigs infected by low-dose aerosol exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lesions were prominent in such images, and colorized three-dimensional reconstructions of images revealed a very uniform distribution in the lungs.

Numbers of lesions in unprotected and vaccinated animals were similar over the first month but increased thereafter in the control animals, indicating secondary lesion development. Whereas lesion sizes increased progressively in control guinea pigs, lesions remained small in BCG-vaccinated animals. A prominent feature of the disease pathology in unprotected animals was rapid and severe lymphadenopathy of the mediastinal lymph node cluster, which is paradoxical given the strong state of cellular immunity at this time.

Immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with purified BM protein formulated in Freund's incomplete adjuvant induced the production of Th 1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, and IL- 2) and multifunctional CD 4 + T cells. Vaccination of BALB/c mice with BM protein followed by intravenous challenge with Mycobacterium bovis BCG resulted in better levels of protection than the two leading antigens, Ag 85 A and PPE 18.
