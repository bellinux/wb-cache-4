5|$|At 08:15:44UTC on 18 November, Atlantis undocked from <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module's bottom {{androgynous}} unit, leaving <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module permanently {{attached to}} the Kristall module, where it provided clearance between the shuttle and Mirs solar arrays during subsequent dockings.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew members}} also {{checked out the}} Advanced Space Vision System, a precise {{alignment}} system for the robot arm that was tested on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted {{of a series of}} large dots placed on the exterior of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> sheds {{were used}} for grain storage and then for {{imported}} livestock. In 1890, a pumping station was installed on the river wall adjoining to <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> This slowly silted <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and by <b>the</b> 1960s <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> had silted up, leaving <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> derelict by 1992.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{closed in}} 1968, part of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> still exists, {{but without a}} lock {{connection}} to Humber Dock; the Princes Quay shopping centre opened in 1991 was built over part of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> on stilts, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> now features a fountain.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{opened in}} 1880 {{and was named}} William Wright <b>Dock</b> after <b>the</b> Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Company. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was 5.75 acre in size.|$|R
5|$|Crew {{members also}} mounted a {{centerline}} camera {{into the top}} hatch of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module. The camera later provided the primary visual cue for Cameron as he maneuvered Atlantis to its docking with Mir on flight day four.|$|E
5|$|The mating was {{confirmed}} at 1:17am CST, with Atlantis over eastern Europe on its 30th orbit. Shortly after the capture, Commander Ken Cameron expressed the crew's {{appreciation for the}} training that prepared them for <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module installation.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:00am CST, {{the crew}} {{received}} a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 {{pounds per square}} inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered in the event that a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{was called}} <b>The</b> <b>Dock</b> until <b>the</b> {{construction}} of further docks, whence {{it was called}} <b>The</b> Old <b>Dock,</b> it was officially named <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Dock</b> in 1855.|$|R
50|$|Defendant Lake Erie was at <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> of {{plaintiff}} Vincent {{to unload}} cargo from Reynolds, the steamship {{owned by the}} defendant. An unusually violent storm developed. Lake Erie was unable to leave <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> safely and deckhands for the steamship instead tied the Reynolds to <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> continually changing ropes {{as they began to}} wear and break. A sudden fierce wind threw the ship against <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> significantly damaging <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was in use until 1975 {{when the}} fishing {{industry}} was moved to Albert Dock at which point <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> closed. Partial filling in of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> began in <b>the</b> 1980s. The western part has been redeveloped into the St Andrews Quay retail park while {{the eastern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> around <b>the</b> entrance was declared a conservation area in 1990 due to its social historic interest. [...] <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> entrance, and some shipping company buildings remain in situ, but the remains of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> are completely silted up.|$|R
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>docking,</b> Mirs {{attitude}} control system was used to spin the station, to provide spin-stabilisation {{in order to further}} conserve the fuel, as the station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could not be used for {{attitude control}}. The station would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{delivered}} {{a pair of}} solar arrays along with the Russian-built Mir Docking Module to allow docking with the station by the space shuttle without moving Mirs Kristall module. During the three-day docking, the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between Atlantis and Mir, moved several long-term experiments, and upgraded the station with new equipment, particularly during the installation of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the mission}} the Expedition 1 crew filmed footage {{for use in}} the IMAX {{documentary}} film, Space Station 3D. Highlights of the footage include the first entry into the Destiny module, during STS-98; the Expedition 1 crew showering and shaving in zero gravity; and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> of STS-102, followed by the change over to the Expedition 2 crew.|$|E
5000|$|The tail of {{the horse}} and other equines {{consists}} of two parts, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and <b>the</b> skirt. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> consists of <b>the</b> muscles and skin covering the coccygeal vertebrae. The term [...] "skirt" [...] refers to the long hairs that fall below <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> On a horse, long, thick tail hairs begin to grow {{at the base of}} the tail, and grow along the top and sides of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> In donkeys and other members of Equus asinus, as well as some mules, the zebra and the wild Przewalski's horse, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> has short hair at the top of <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> with longer, coarser skirt hairs beginning to grow only toward the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Hair does not grow at all on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{land for}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was {{obtained}} in 1768. Opening in 1773, Duke's Dock was built privately for the Duke of Bridgewater as a Liverpool-based facility for traffic using the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was probably designed by James Brindley, who also built the Bridgewater Canal. The first dockside warehouse on the Mersey was built at <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> in 1783, and <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was extended in the 1790s due to {{growth in the}} cotton industry. In 1811, a large six-storey warehouse {{was built on the}} southern side of <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Barges were able to enter the warehouse from <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and <b>the</b> building lasted until the 1960s. In 1845, a small half-tide dock was constructed between Duke's <b>Dock</b> and <b>the</b> river and, {{at the opposite end of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> Wapping Basin was added in 1855. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was purchased by the MD&HB in 1900, and the warehouses remained until 1960. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> had a southern branch which was filled in 1967, and warehouses were removed from the north and south quaysides. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> closed in 1972.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel {{from the}} Garston and Liverpool Railway emerged at <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and <b>the</b> second Herculaneum <b>Dock</b> railway station of the Liverpool Overhead Railway was {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> from 1896. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was further improved in 1898, by widening the entrances and deepening <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Harrington Dock {{was used by}} the Elder Dempster Lines and its associated businesses.|$|R
5|$|Today the Albert Dock {{is a major}} tourist {{attraction}} {{in the city and}} the most visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom, outside London. It is a vital component of Liverpool's UNESCO designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it {{to land on the}} Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Railway <b>Dock</b> was {{connected}} {{on the west}} side of Humber <b>Dock</b> to <b>the</b> north of Kingston Street, and was smaller than <b>the</b> other town <b>docks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> of 13130 sq ft, approximately 716 by 165 ft was constructed at a cost of £106,000. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> opened 3 December 1846. <b>The</b> <b>Dock</b> Company's engineer was J.B Hartley, also engineer on <b>the</b> east <b>dock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{major feature}} of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> today is London City Airport, whose single runway has been {{constructed}} {{the length of}} the south side of <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> forming <b>the</b> northern boundary of the airport. <b>The</b> filled dry <b>docks</b> and ship repair works site lie under the runway. Aircraft movements are clearly visible across <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> from <b>the</b> largely accessible north quayside.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> {{consists}} of a rock-walled marina with an opening for boats. The bridge is normally closed, allowing pedestrian access around <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is normally used by motor pleasure boats, yachts, and fishing boats serving the city's fish market and restaurants, several of which are at {{the northern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b>|$|R
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> module over to Atlantiss docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E
50|$|A kayaker {{performs}} a bow stall while their hands {{are on a}} dock. Then, pushing on <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>the</b> kayaking creates momentum to propel themselves upwards {{and out of the}} water to get on <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> best {{way to do this is}} to twist your body and jump towards <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> kayaker thens ends up sitting flat on <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose of this is to easily remove the kayaker from the water.|$|R
50|$|Between 1844 and 1921, the Ordnance Datum for the British Isles {{was taken}} from the level of <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Dock.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was altered in 1848. By 1858, the largest share of <b>the</b> <b>dock's</b> trade was with America. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> was unmodernised until 1929.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> at Exmouth {{could take}} vessels up to 750 tons; most traffic was inwards, but {{outwards}} traffic included herrings for London. Wagons for <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> were propelled {{as there was}} no run-round facility there. Formal termination {{of the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> took place in December 1967; <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> itself continued in use until December 1990.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 {{was troubled}} {{by the failure of}} the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented <b>the</b> <b>docking.</b> After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-8 on 5 September 1989 marked the {{beginning}} of the longest human presence in space, until 23 October 2010, when this record was surpassed by the ISS. It also {{marked the beginning}} of Mir's second expansion. The Kvant-2 and Kristall modules were now ready for launch. Alexander Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov docked with Mir and brought the station out of its five-month hibernation. On 29 September the cosmonauts installed equipment in <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system in preparation for the arrival of Kvant-2, the first of the 20tonne add-on modules based on the TKS spacecraft from the Almaz programme.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging one shot a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, most of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> basin {{was used as}} a {{designated}} landfill site. This has left only a section of the northern part of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and a narrow channel along <b>the</b> eastern <b>dock</b> wall. What remains of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> provides access to Clarence Graving Docks.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is 1,139 ft long, with a {{width of}} 147 ft. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> is 45 ft deep at spring tide. When filled, <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> has a {{capacity}} of 50,000,000 imp gal. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> can be drained in a four-hour period {{through the use of}} three 60 in centrifugal pumps (each with a discharge capacity around 70,500 imp gal per minute).|$|R
5000|$|Structural {{improvements}} {{were made}} to <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> basin in 1842 and 1855. The opening of <b>the</b> Albert <b>Dock</b> in 1846 allowed vessels to be unloaded there, {{before moving on to}} <b>the</b> Salthouse <b>Dock</b> for loading. By the mid-19th century, the main trade from <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was with China and the East Indies. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> served square rigged sailing ships until about 1914.|$|R
