5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it {{was nothing more than}} an empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E
5|$|Morton soon rose {{through the}} party ranks, {{becoming}} touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested the leadership in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton <b>then</b> <b>stood,</b> but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take the leadership. Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{returned}} to the key task of direct support to troops at Kosong 7 June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she {{returned to}} troop support at Kosong, her assignment until 10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.|$|E
5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief flurry of punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a flurry of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the clinch and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{was one of}} two {{contrasting}} halves for the Highlanders. The {{team won}} their first four matches — against the Chiefs, Crusaders, Waratahs, and Hurricanes. By that point the Highlanders were {{on the top of the}} table, but lost the position after losing to the Brumbies in Canberra. After a win over the Rebels, loss to the Stormers, and a bye, the Highlanders defeated the Blues 30–27 in Dunedin. They narrowly defeated the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein in round 10; they <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> fifth in the table. The team went on to lose five of their seven remaining matches, and slip to ninth on the table after the end of the regular season. Despite winning more matches than in 2011, the Highlanders finished fourth in the New Zealand conference — with only the Blues below them.|$|E
5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal <b>then</b> <b>stood</b> {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
