Through the research of the cutting and welding technology for the 209 T straight plate type <b>brake</b> <b>beam,</b> this paper presents an advanced maintenance method, and designs an automatic cutting and welding machine for the brake beam-axle, then studies the basic structure and working principle for the machine in detail. The automatic cutting and welding machine has been operating properly since been used in the maintenance workshop. What is more, the maintenance of each <b>brake</b> <b>beam</b> only spends about 15 minutes, so this advanced maintenance method can improve the efficiency of the maintenance appropriately, and ensure the reliability of maintenance quality...|$|R

50|$|In an ICF BMBC Bogie, {{the brake}} {{cylinder}} {{is mounted on}} the bogie frame itself. Traditionally, the ICF Bogies were conventional type i.e. the brake cylinder was {{mounted on the body}} of the coach. However, in the later modification, the new bogies are being manufactured with the BMBC designs only. Even the old type bogies are being converted into BMBC Bogies. The BMBC bogie has many advantages over the conventional ICF bogie. The foremost being that, since the brake cylinder is mounted on the bogie frame itself and is nearer to the <b>brake</b> <b>beam,</b> the <b>brake</b> application time is reduced. Moreover, a small brake cylinder is adequate for braking purpose. This also reduces the overall weight of the ICF bogie apart from the advantage of quick brake application.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of this project is to study the corrosion that occurs in Railway coach’s bogie components, causes of corrosion, steps taken to prevent corrosion, suggestions to minimize this problem. This paper contains new suggestions to minimize the problems: more emphasis has been laid on Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) coating to be suggested instead of black enamel or epoxy coating for bogie frame and bogie components of equalising rod and <b>brake</b> <b>beam.</b> The under mentioned components are the most affected parts due to corrosion {{near the bottom of}} lavatory. Another reason for bogie frame corrosion is easy peeling off coating surfaces due to scratch or dent marks produced by striking of ballast when trains are running. The corrosion prevention behavior of commercially available epoxy coated surfaces and Teflon coated surfaces on structural steel were evaluated using various methods such as 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution salt spray test, 25 % (v/v) sulphuric acid immersion test and loss of weight. Two different systems of coatings were selected for evaluation. The test panels same as of bogie component material composition were prepared and subjected to specific test as per experimental procedure. Optical microscope image were recorded on completion of corrosion test. We observed that after 504 hrs. exposure in atmospheric, Teflon coatings are still good in resisting abrasion and can withstand against corrosion more effective than other coatings...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{preparation}} and performance of the experiments on the nuclear resonant fluorescence on the continuous action electron accelerator - split microtron injector of the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University. The plants for performing the nuclear resonant fluorescence (NRF) experiments have been created. The basic characteristics of the excitated states in the nuclei of fP-shell have been determined. The results of the more earlier experiments have been made accurate significantly. The experiment on the self-absorption of one of the resonant lines of * 995 * 996 Fe nuclear has been made firstly. The deformation parameters a number of the fP-shell nuclei have been determined from comparison with data of the theoretical designs. The methods developed during preparation and performance of the experiments on NRF are unique and in the fiture can be applied at performing investigation both in the fundamental and in the applied fields. Besides, a number of the obtained results eliminates the uncertainities in the values of some nuclear characteristics. The developed methods can be recommended to those scientific centres where the works with <b>braking</b> <b>beams</b> at low energies are made and also for performing works on the element analysis of the materialsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} a bend is {{determined}} by the accuracy and consistency of the angle {{along the length of the}} part. This accuracy is directly related to the penetration of the tool in the die. Small variations in tool penetration can cause relatively large changes in bend angle. Such variations are caused by changes in the repeatability of the tool stopping point, by deflections of the press <b>brake</b> <b>beams</b> and by distortions of the tooling. Earlier studies [Int. J. Mech. Sci. 22 (1980) 583; J. Mater. Process. Technol. 35 (1992) 129; Precision bending of sheet metal, Master's Thesis, University of Twente, 1992; A finite element simulation of free bending, in: Proceedings of the Second International Sheet Metal Conference, SheMet' 94, University of Ulster, 1994, pp. 201 - 211] on finite element modelling of the air bending process assume that the tooling is perfectly rigid. The present 3 D finite element model of press brake air bending tools allows calculation of elastic distortions in typical tools and relates the distortion to the accuracy of the formed part. The finite element model has been validated by experiments conducted on a commercial press brake. Some suggestions are made for improvements to the direct and cross stiffness of the tools which should lead to improved alignment of the tool and die and, in turn, to improved product accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical and experimental investigation {{on the property}} of modal disparity in a vibrating structure. For a given structure, the concept of modal disparity describes its ability to generate {{significant changes in the}} mode shapes by some type of on-the-fly structural modification. In the present study we consider a vibrating beam that experiences a controlled stiffness change, induced by the activation and deactivation of an electromagnetic <b>brake.</b> The <b>beam</b> has two stiffness states corresponding to the two states of the brake. The mechanisms of braking and brake release are mathematically modeled using the principle of impulse and momentum and a finite element model of the beam that adequately describes both stiffness states is developed. The transformation matrix which maps the modal displacements and velocities between the two stiffness states is derived and it is shown that this matrix is a measure of modal disparity, i. e., how well energy can be redistributed between the modes. Experiments were conducted to validate energy redistribution between modes through stiffness variation. A clamped-clamped aluminum beam with a hinge and built-in electromagnetic brake was used for the experiments. A piezoelectric strain sensor was used for sensing and a pair of piezoelectric transducers were used for excitation. It is shown that significant amounts of energy can be shifted back and forth between different sets of modes in a systematic and predictable manner. This confirmation of modal disparity for a specific structural system opens the door for a number of potential applications in passive and active control of vibrating structures. N/...|$|R
