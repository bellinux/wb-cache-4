5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus {{first tried}} to work with Highmore and asked to run the {{operations}} of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.|$|E

25|$|Sangster {{promptly}} made Edward Turner head of {{the automotive}} division which as well as Daimler and Carbodies (London Taxicab manufacturers) included Ariel, Triumph, and BSA motorcycles. Turner designed the lightweight hemi head Daimler 2.5 & 4.5 Litre V8 Engines. The small engine was used to power a production version of an apprentice's exercise, the very flexible Dart and the larger engine installed in the Majestic Major, a relabelled Majestic. Under Sangster Daimler's vehicles became a little less sober and more performance oriented. The Majestic Major proved an agile high-speed cruiser on the new motorways. Bill Boddy described the SP250 as unlikely <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> memories of such ghosts as haunt the tree-lined avenues near Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor Castle.|$|E

500|$|After 1945, {{stories of}} the Lalaurie slaves became {{considerably}} more explicit. Jeanne deLavigne, writing in Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans (1946), alleged that Lalaurie had a [...] "sadistic appetite [...] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on {{one or more of}} her black servitors some hideous form of torture" [...] and claimed that those who responded to the 1834 fire had found [...] "male slaves, stark naked, chained to the wall, their eyes gouged out, their fingernails pulled off by the roots; others had their joints skinned and festering, great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away, their ears hanging by shreds, their lips sewn together... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> brains." [...] DeLavigne did not directly cite any sources for these claims, and they were not supported by the primary sources.|$|E
500|$|... "The very {{air of the}} place", wrote Hazlitt {{about the}} Forest of Arden, [...] "seems to breathe a spirit of {{philosophical}} poetry; <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> thoughts, to touch the heart with pity, as the drowsy forest rustles to the sighing gale", and the character who most embodies the philosophical spirit of the place is Jacques, who [...] "is the only purely contemplative character in Shakespear." [...] Among the lovers, Hazlitt particularly likes the character of Rosalind, [...] "made up of sportive gaiety and natural tenderness". And the couples, Touchstone and Audrey, and Silvius and Phebe, have their different places in the picture. The other characters, including Orlando and the Duke, also come in for their share of commentary. [...] All in all, Hazlitt finds this {{to be one of}} the most quotable and quoted of Shakespear's plays: [...] "There is hardly any of Shakespear's [...] plays that contains a greater number of passages that have been quoted in books of extracts, or a greater number of phrases that have become in a manner proverbial." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} Parasite Eve II was written, {{arranged}} and produced by Naoshi Mizuta. Parasite Eve II was Mizuta's first project as lead composer at Square after transferring from Capcom. He {{spent a year}} and a half working on the soundtrack, frequently referencing the game's scenario and visuals. He was also influenced by multiple unspecified films from multiple genres including action films. He matched his music to the scenario, characters and environments, since he desired <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> players emotions without distracting from the game. Many of his tracks were created on request, but he otherwise had a high amount of creative freedom. Multiple tracks were remixes and rearrangements of Shimomura's original music for Parasite Eve: according to Mizuta, the arrangements were easy due to the original tracks' strength. In a later interview, Mizuta called his work on Parasite Eve II very different from his later work on Final Fantasy XI and [...] Guitar elements for the tracks [...] "Forbidden Power" [...] and [...] "Douglas' Blues" [...] were performed by Tsuyoshi Sekito and Yuji Isogawa respectively. Arrangements for multiple tracks were done by Hiroshi Nakajima, who later felt that he intentionally [...] "betrayed" [...] Mizuta's work while creating the arrangements. Additional mixing was done by Hiroshi Nakajima and Kenji Nagashima. Sound samples used in some tracks were taken from the Q Ups Art Sonic Images Library CD release.|$|E
500|$|Peasant {{anger in}} Keserwan had been {{building}} since the mid-19th century, due {{to a number of}} factors, including the burdens of corv√©e (unpaid labor for a landlord) that had been imposed during the rule of Emir Bashir Shihab II, general economic hardship, and the decreasing availability of land. The Maronite Khazen family traditionally served as the sheikhs (chiefs) of Keserwan, although their power had been significantly diminished during Emir Bashir's rule. The Khazens opposed the creation of the [...] "Double Qaimaqmate" [...] in Mount Lebanon in the 1840s, which divided Mount Lebanon into Druze and Christian-run sectors, and were incensed at the appointment of a sheikh from the mixed Druze-Christian Abu'l Lama family as the qaimaqam (deputy governor) of the Maronite section of the Qaimaqamate. The Khazens feared that such an appointment would formally subordinate them to the Abu'l Lama sheikhs. Following the Abu'l Lama sheikh's death in 1854, his successor Bashir Ahmad Abu'l Lama attempted to further reduce the Khazens' influence, prompting the Khazens <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> peasants to revolt against Bashir Ahmad. The revolt against Bashir Ahmad soon turned against the Khazen sheikhs and their feudal allies. The peasant subjects of the Khazen sheikhs had long been wary of their rule due to the excessive taxes they imposed as well as the additional gifts the peasants were virtually obligated to give the sheikhs, which many [...] peasants considered humiliating.|$|E
500|$|Both AllHipHop and Billboard {{were very}} {{positive}} toward Gravity after a preview listening session, considering it Lecrae's strongest and most mainstream work to date. AllHipHop stated that [...] "overall, {{it appears that}} Lecrae is ready to offer {{one of his most}} broad and, dare-we-say, mainstream albums in terms of sound; yet, it still manages to capture the trueness of what he has always stood for and rapped about. If anything, Gravity is a giant step forward for his expanding career, and it will surely be a welcome addition to many 'Top 10' lists when 2012 comes to a close." [...] Indie Vision Music in announcing the cover of Gravity called the album [...] "likely the biggest Christian hip hop album yet". AllHipHop listed [...] "Mayday" [...] as one of the standout tracks on the album, noting the [...] "beautiful" [...] melody and hook by Ashthon Jones. The reviewer considered [...] "Violence" [...] a personal favorite, calling Lecrae's line [...] "Grew up under Tupac, bible verse and two glocks" [...] {{one of the most powerful}} lines on the album. Parl√© Magazine also was favorable to the song, stating [...] "That track is definitely going places." [...] Jonathan Landrum of The Associated Press was favorable to the album, saying that [...] "in his sixth album 'Gravity,' Lecrae delivers a strong piece of work. He's not afraid to rap about his past mistakes, supplying inspirational rhymes filled with Christian values backed by well-produced secular hip-hop beats." [...] In its track-by-track review of the album, The Boombox stated that [...] "based on the warm reception to Church Clothes, this LP is set <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> <b>the</b> pot further in the realm of both of hip-hop and Christianity." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, declaring that Lecrae makes Gravitys various genre experiments and jumps in style [...] "sound effortless and natural". He asserted that [...] "while Rehab is the more rewarding album in the end, this one is more persuasive and immediate, making it an easy entry point into this gifted artist's discography." ...|$|E
