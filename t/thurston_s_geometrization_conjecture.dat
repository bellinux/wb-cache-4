It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the <b>geometrization</b> <b>conjecture</b> states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure.

In this {{paper we propose}} a counterexample to this conjecture by using the Dehn surgery method of constructing closed 3 -manifolds [4][5]. Let K 1 RT denote the right trefoil knot with framing 1. Let Kr E denote the figure-eight knot with framing r where r = p q is a rational number (p and q are co-prime integers) such that r> 4. We then consider a Dehn surgery on the framed link L = K 1 RT ∪ Kr E where the linking ∪ is in the simplest Hopf link type. We have that the Dehn surgery on K 1 RT gives the Poincaré sphere M 1 RT which is with spherical geometry and with a finite nontrivial fundamental group [1][2][4][6][7]. Then we have that the Dehn [1][2][6][7]. We want to show that the 3 -manifold surgery on Kr E gives a hyperbolic manifold Mr E ML obtained from surgery on L is irreducible and atoroidal, and is not geometric. From this we then have that ML is a counterexample of the <b>Geometrization</b> <b>Conjecture.</b> Let us first show that ML is irreducible and atoroidal.
