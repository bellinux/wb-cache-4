40|$|Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and {{artesunate}} (ARS), two artemisinin derivatives, have efficacious anticancer activities against human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells. This study aims {{to study}} the anticancer action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA/ARS and farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), a Ras inhibitor, in HCC cells (Huh- 7 and HepG 2 cell lines). FTS pretreatment significantly enhanced DHA/ARS-induced phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, Bak/Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase- 8 and - 9 activations, characteristics of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Pretreatment with Z-IETD-FMK (caspase- 8 inhibitor) potently prevented the cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA/ARS and FTS, and pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the loss of ΔΨm induced by DHA/ARS <b>treatment</b> or <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA/ARS and FTS in HCC cells. Furthermore, silencing Bak/Bax modestly but significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA/ARS and FTS. Interestingly, pretreatment with an antioxidant N-Acetyle-Cysteine (NAC) significantly prevented the cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA and FTS instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> ARS and FTS, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{played a key role}} in the anticancer action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combination <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> DHA and FTS. Similar to FTS, DHA/ARS also significantly prevented Ras activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that FTS potently sensitizes Huh- 7 and HepG 2 cells to artemisinin derivatives via accelerating the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways...|$|R
