40|$|The term “dioxins” used colloquially {{not only}} {{encompasses}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins but also dibenzofurans. Both have similar chemical, physical and toxic properties and occur as mixtures. In {{the two groups}} – “dioxins” and dioxin-like, polychlorinated biphenyls (dl- PCBs) – there are individual substances with differing degrees of toxicity, called congeners. In order to express the differing degrees of toxicity of these congeners in the mixtures, the World Health Organisation (WHO) introduced the system of <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents.</b> The toxicity of individual substances is {{compared with that of}} the most toxic congener, 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, better known as “Seveso dioxin”. The toxicity equivalency factor indicates the respective difference in toxicity. By multiplying them by the toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs), the amounts of the individual congeners are initially calculated as <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents.</b> They are then added together to give the total concentration of <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (TEQs). WHO determined the toxicity equivalency factors in 1998. Within the framework of a routine review it reassessed these factors and published revised TEFs in 2005 although the toxicological data situation had not changed. For around half of the congeners the TEFs have remained the same, for the others they are mostly lower than the previous values. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has now examined whether and, if so, how these “new” TEFs affect the calculation of the total sum of <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents.</b> As exposure estimates indicate that a considerable proportion of the population has an elevated dioxin intake BfR felt there was a risk that this could lead to a lower level of consumer health protection and recommended and that the TEFs should only be amended when new, relevant toxicological findings became available.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are {{synthetic}} chemicals, {{manufactured in}} volume from about 1929 to the 1970 s. Environmental contamination by PCBs {{has been documented}} in various substances, including human tissue. PCBs have been measured in human tissue {{by a variety of}} analytical methods. PCB levels have been reported as an approximation of total PCB content expressed in terms of a commercial mixture, by identification and quantification of chromatographic peaks, or by qualitative and quantitative characterization of specific congeners. Until recently, the coplanar mono-ortho- and di-ortho substituted PCBs, which are especially toxic and present in significant concentration in humans from industrial countries, had not been measured in human tissues. Examples of various types of commonly used analyses are presented in general population subjects and in persons who experienced special exposure. In this paper, the usefulness of PCB blood determinations following potential exposure is demonstrated, and their application in health studies is illustrated from a number of case studies. Coplanar PCB, mono-ortho-substituted and di-ortho-substituted PCB levels in human blood are presented and compared with polychlorinated dioxin (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) levels in the U. S. population. Dioxin <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> for the two groups of chemicals are calculated and compared. It is found that mono-ortho-substituted and, to a lesser extent, coplanar PCBs, contribute substantially to dioxin <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (TEq) in blood from U. S. adults. Because of substantial PCB contribution to dioxin <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents,</b> total dioxinlike toxicity can only be determined if dioxins, dibenzofurans, and dioxinlike PCBs are measured.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{case-control study}} was {{designed}} to determine the possible association between chronic exposure to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the occurrence of endometriosis. The study group consisted of 42 infertile endometriosis cases and 27 mechanical infertile controls, both groups attending one of the collaborating Centres for Reproductive Medicine, enrolled between 1996 - 1998. METHODS: Exposure assessment to dioxin-like compounds was determined through CALUX (chemical-activated luciferase gene expression) -bioassay to measure dioxin-like total <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (dioxins and co-planar PCBs), whereas non-co-planar PCBs were determined through chemical analysis. RESULTS: No association was found between median dioxin-like total <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalents</b> (TEQ) and the occurrence of endometriosis in infertile women [cases (n = 34) : 29; controls (n = 27) : 24; NS]. When patients were subdivided based on an arbitrary cut-off value of 100 pg TEQ/g serum lipids, no statistically significant association between very high exposure to dioxin-like compounds and endometriosis was found [crude odds ratio (OR) = 4. 33; confidence interval (CI) 0. 49 - 38. 19; NS]. After adjusting for body mass index, and alcohol consumption, the risk increased slightly to OR = 4. 6 (CI 0. 48 - 43. 62; NS). There was no confounding by age, ovulatory dysfunction, caffeine intake, smoking or exposure to non-co-planar PCBs.

40|$|Abstract—Concentrations of dioxins in surface {{sediment}}s and a sediment core {{from the}} coast of southern Vietnam were determined. In surface sediments, concentrations of both PCDD/DFs and coplanar-PCBs were higher in inland than in offshore samples. However, proportion of PCDFs in total PCDD/DFs was higher in inland than in the marine area samples, {{and it can be}} presumed that some combustion source might exist in inland acting as a source of PCDD/ DFs to this region. On the other hand, coplanar-PCBs were specifically high in particular locations of inland and marine area, indicating that scattered hotspots may be present both in inland and the marine areas. Various technical PCBs can be suspected as pollution sources depending on the isomer profiles of different commercial mixtures. In core sediment analysis, no temporal trend either in total concentration or isomer profile was observed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, which was present in chemical defoliants, was not detected in any of the layers analyzed. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD which is present in chemical defoliants might have diffused in the ocean or remain in deeper layers than in the depth of from which the sample for the present study was collected.
