25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or calcium gluconate) increases <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> {{through a}} mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% calcium gluconate is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia. This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate. Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line. Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes. The goal of treatment is to normalize the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|Triggered {{activity}} can occur {{due to the}} presence of afterdepolarisations. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach <b>threshold</b> <b>potential,</b> but, if they do, they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, {{which in turn}} increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E

On the basis of four biologically motivated assumptions, it is found that only two forms of learning are possible, Hebbian and Anti–Hebbian learning. It is shown that Hebbian learning memorizes input–output relations, while Anti– Hebbian learning does the opposite: it changes the input–output relations of the network. Hebbian learning should take place when the output is right, while there should be Anti–Hebbian learning when the output is wrong. A particular choice for the Anti–Hebbian part of the learning rule is made, which guarantees an adequate average neuronal activity.

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that most cardiac myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential.</b> Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions K+, a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions Na+, increased permeability to Na+, or a decreased permeability to K+. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to 50 to 60mV.|$|E
500|$|GABA {{controls}} the excitability of neurons by binding to the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor is a protein complex {{located in the}} synapses of neurons. All GABAA receptors contain an ion channel that conducts chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes and two binding sites for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABAA receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA. Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding, benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor. [...] This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
2500|$|Each excitable {{patch of}} {{membrane}} has two important levels of membrane potential: [...] the resting potential, {{which is the}} value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential.</b> [...] At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the resting potential is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> is around –55 mV. [...] Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. [...] Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. [...] When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. [...] The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, {{the rise and fall}} usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. [...] (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). [...] In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. [...] Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.|$|E
40|$|A {{feed-forward}} neural net with adaptable synaptic {{weights and}} fixed, zero or non-zero <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials</b> is studied, {{in the presence}} of a global feedback signal that can only have two values, depending on whether the output of the network in reaction to its input is right or wrong. It is found, on the basis of four biologically motivated assumptions, that only two forms of learning are possible, Hebbian and Anti-Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning should take place when the output is right, while there should be Anti-Hebbian learning when the output is wrong. For the Anti-Hebbian part of the learning rule a particular choice is made, which guarantees an adequate average neuronal activity without the need of introducing, by hand, control mechanisms like extremal dynamics.

40|$|Ti Gr 7 is an {{extremely}} corrosion resistant material, with a very stable passive film. Based upon exposures in the LTCTF, it has been determined that the general corrosion and oxidation rates of Ti Gr 7 are essentially {{below the level of}} detection. In any event, over the 10, 000 year life of the repository, general corrosion and oxidation should not be life limiting. The large separation between measured corrosion and <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials</b> indicate that localized breakdown of the passive film is unlikely under plausible conditions, even in SSW at 120 C. In the future, the pH and current in crevices formed from Ti Gr 7 should be determined experimentally. With exposures of two years, no significant evidence of crevice corrosion has been observed with Ti Gr 16 in SDW, SCW, and SAW at temperatures up to 9 O C, though many of the samples have a beautiful green patina. An abstracted model has been presented, with parameters determined experimentally, that should enable performance assessment to account for the general and localized corrosion of this material. A feature of this model is the use of the materials specification to limit the range of corrosion and <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials,</b> thereby making sure that substandard materials prone to localized attack are avoided...|$|R

40|$|Nanotechnology {{produces}} basic {{structures that}} show a significant variability in their individual physical properties. This experimental fact may constitute a serious limitation for most applications requiring nominally identical building blocks. On the other hand, biological diversity {{is found in}} most natural systems. We show that reliable information processing can be achieved with heterogeneous groups of non-identical nanostructures by using some conceptual schemes characteristic of biological networks (diversity, frequency-based signal processing, rate and rank order coding, and synchronization). To this end, we simulate the integrated response of an ensemble of single-electron transistors (SET) whose individual <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials</b> show a high variability. A particular experimental realization of a SET is a metal nanoparticle-based transistor that mimics biological spiking synapses and can be modeled as an integrate-and-fire oscillator. The different shape and size distributions of nanoparticles inherent to the nanoscale fabrication procedures result in a significant variability in the <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials</b> of the SET. The statistical distributions of the nanoparticle physical parameters are characterized by experimental average and distribution width values. We consider simple but general information processing schemes to draw conclusions that should be of relevance for other threshold-based nanostructures. Monte Carlo simulations show that ensembles of non-identical SET may show some advantages over ensembles of identical nanostructures concerning the processing of weak signals. The results obtained are also relevant for understanding the role of diversity in biophysica...|$|R

(i), (iii) and (iv) were voltage dependent, being most prominent at <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials.</b> The data show that a voltage dependent action on the activation gate can account for the observed reduction of peak inward sodium current and prolongation of current decay in macroscopic experiments...|$|R

It was found that at - 140 C, the radiation-induced shifts in the <b>threshold</b> <b>potentials</b> were similar for all three processes. The radiation hardness of the Z- and J-process is primarily due to rapid annealing {{of radiation}} damage at room temperature.

50|$|Hyperpolarization, on {{the other}} hand, is {{employed}} to reduce neuronal activity by establishing a high <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> for firing across an action potential.

50|$|They soon {{discovered}} that at <b>threshold</b> <b>potential,</b> the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane potential, the threshold potential's conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers {{to the fact that}} any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. The basis is that at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E
