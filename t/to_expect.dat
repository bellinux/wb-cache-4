40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} value of antenatally {{determined}} observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> fetal lung area to head circumference ratio (LHR) in the prediction of postnatal survival in isolated, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: Two groups of fetuses were examined. The first group included 650 normal fetuses at 12 - 32 weeks' gestation, and the data collected were used to establish a normal range of observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR with gestational age. The second group included the data of a retrospective multicenter study of 354 fetuses with isolated CDH in which the LHR was measured on one occasion at 18 - 38 weeks' gestation. The patients were divided into those with left-sided CDH with and without intrathoracic herniation of the liver and right-sided CDH. Regression {{analysis was used to}} determine the significant predictors of postnatal survival. RESULTS: In both the normal fetuses and those with CDH the LHR increased but the observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR did not change significantly with gestational age. In normal fetuses the mean observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR in the left lung was 100 % (95 % CI, 61 - 139 %) and in the right lung it was 100 % (95 % CI, 67 - 133 %). In fetuses with CDH the mean observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR was 39 % (range 7 - 79 %). Regression analysis demonstrated that significant predictors of survival were the observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR (odds ratio (OR) 1. 09, 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 12), side of CDH (left side OR 11. 14, 95 % CI, 3. 41 - 36. 39) and gestational age at delivery (OR 1. 18, 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 36). CONCLUSION: In CDH, the LHR increases while observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR is independent of gestational age. In fetuses with both left- and right-sided CDH, measurement of the observed <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> LHR provides a useful prediction of subsequent survival. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{the total}} return {{variation}} explained by shocks <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> cash flows, time-varying expected returns, and shocks <b>to</b> <b>expected</b> returns {{is one way}} to judge the rationality of stock prices. Variables that proxy for expected returns and expected-return shocks capture 30 percent of the variance of annual NYSE value-weighted returns.

Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson, who introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store. He instructs Bart on military tactics, then Bart declares war on Nelson and his sidekicks.|$|E

His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs.

The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. Exactly how many men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.|$|E
