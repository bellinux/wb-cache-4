And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E

In a twitter video posted by Rodman, his agent Chris Volo said, [...] "He's the only person on the planet that has the uniqueness, the unbelievable privilege of being friends with President Trump and Marshal Kim Jong Un." [...] Rodman went on to say in the video that he wanted to bring peace and [...] "open doors between both countries." ...|$|E

Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former {{legislative}} colleague Ron Gomez described Gunter {{as having}} what urban people call [...] "street smarts, that innate ability, also common to many rural folk, to smell a phony an acre away, {{to be suspicious}} of everyone who didn't dress or talk like him and to cut {{to the heart of}} a matter with cold precision. His politics were populist in nature. He was regularly graded high by organized labor and low by business and professional associations", such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Gomez said that he and Gunter did not become friends but [...] "shared a mutual respect. Whether I shared Carl's beliefs or he disliked the way I talked, we realized <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> got to the House the same way and for the same reason: we were there to represent the people of our respective districts. I hoped that all {{the other members of the}} House practiced that philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin {{expressed}} {{support for}} a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that [...] "Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, {{that that is what}} they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements." [...] Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that [...] "I'm so encouraged to know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1979, Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had {{a fourth}} attempt at Melodifestivalen {{and this time}} they won with the song [...] "Satellit", a mid-tempo rock track whose {{arrangement}} bore resemblances to Toto's 1978 hit [...] "Hold the Line". The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest. The {{connection between the two}} songs was that the song's producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate and Steve Lukather, experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the Blue Virgin Isles sessions in Los Angeles, which eventually evolved into [...] "Hold the Line". Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for [...] "Satellit", but at that point neither [...] "Hold the Line" [...] nor Toto's debut eponymous album had been released. Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in February 1979: [...] "No, it's not a rip-off, Ted did not steal our song. Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s and the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> have happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental." [...] Consequently, Ted represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem in March 1979. After having competed four times in the pre-selections before winning and with his personal connection to ABBA, [...] hopes and expectations were high. The song scored eight points and finished seventeenth out of nineteen participating entries, making it Sweden's then-second-lowest placing in the contest. The Swedish-language single became a Top 10 hit back home in Sweden and [...] "Satellit" [...] is regarded as one of Ted's signature tunes. The English-language version of the track never charted and neither did the re-issue of Blue Virgin Isles, which included both versions, making it clear that Ted's Scandinavian audiences favoured his Swedish-language material.|$|E
60|$|Your {{dear friend}} amused me and amused himself {{as long as}} it suited his inclinations; and then {{reminded}} me that we were both people of the world, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> understood mankind, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> knew {{there was no such thing}} as romance, that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth. So he said, and I did not contradict him.|$|E
60|$|He offered these {{friendly}} suggestions in such {{a lively}} way, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> laughed and I scarcely blushed.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{would look}} rather funny, wouldn't it? Well, then, suppose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> get off {{and push the}} tandem along in front of us?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{laughed at}} the grotesqueness of the affair, and the {{laughter}} mixed itself up with the choke--and the Major said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> wanted drinks.|$|E
6000|$|... "And mamma is so glad. From {{the moment}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> talked {{ourselves}} into eagerness about it,--while I was writing my letter, you know, we resolved {{that it must}} be so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{better than}} you, playmate Rames, if I may judge from your sword-play this night. So it seems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> {{of us are}} {{in the way of}} {{becoming}} masters of our trades." ...|$|E

60|$|Sherlock Holmes and I {{surveyed}} this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, {{until the}} comical {{side of the}} affair so completely overtopped every other consideration <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> burst out into a roar of laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be for you to rebuke me with <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> have, <b>both</b> of us, played our game badly, but not for <b>that</b> reason need <b>we</b> <b>both</b> be ruined and broken-hearted. In your folly you thought that wealth was better than love; and I, in my folly--I thought that one love blighted might be mended by another. When I asked Miss Burton to be my wife you were the wife of another man. Now that you are free again I cannot marry Miss Burton." ...|$|R
