5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{witnessing}} {{a young woman}} being robbed and murdered {{by a group of}} men, but she is too frozen in fear to protest. A black man walking down the alley also sees the incident and runs to help the woman, but the murderers flee just as the police arrive. The police mistakenly suspect <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> of being the killer and arrest him. The real murderers give a threatening look towards Madonna and leave. She flees the crime scene and escapes to a church. There she sees a caged statue of saint who resembles <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> on the street. As the song starts, she utters a prayer in front of the statue which appears to be crying.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E

The town constable arranged a ceasefire after many volleys of shots had been leveled at the store. As <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> left <b>the</b> store, eighteen of the white mob again rushed the men and fired on the group. Two of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> were killed (including Carter), two severely injured, and two more slightly injured. None of the white men were injured.|$|R

5|$|The {{colored people}} did not intrude {{themselves}} upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities {{where they are now}} chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves {{enough money to buy}} his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he has returned to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come under the control of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, but {{as long as there are}} black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by the blacks and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E

25|$|In early 1971, Sun Ra was {{appointed}} as artist-in-residence at University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Man</b> In the Cosmos. Few students enrolled, but his classes were often full of curious {{people from the}} surrounding community. One half-hour of each class was devoted to a lecture (complete with handouts and homework assignments), the other half-hour to an Arkestra performance or Sun Ra keyboard solo. Reading lists included the works of Madame Blavatsky and Henry Dumas, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons, The Book of Oahspe, and assorted volumes concerning Egyptian hieroglyphs, African American folklore, and other topics.|$|E
25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|E
60|$|A river winds close {{beside the}} village of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> Tarzan reached its side a little below the {{clearing}} where squat the thatched huts of the Negroes. The river life was ever fascinating to the ape-man. He found pleasure in watching the ungainly antics of Duro, the hippopotamus, and keen sport in tormenting the sluggish crocodile, Gimla, as he basked in the sun. Then, too, there were the shes and the balus of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> of <b>the</b> Gomangani to frighten as they squatted by the river, the shes with their meager washing, the balus with their primitive toys.|$|R

500|$|Beginning in 1901, Tillman {{joined the}} Chautauqua circuit, giving well-paid speeches {{throughout}} the nation. Tillman's reputation, both for his views and his oratory, attracted large crowds. Tillman informed them that African Americans were {{inferior to the}} white man, but were not baboons, though some were [...] "so near akin to the monkey that scientists are yet looking for the missing link". Given that in Africa, they were an [...] "ignorant and debased and debauched race" [...] {{with a record of}} [...] "barbarism, savagery, cannibalism and everything that is low and degrading", it was the [...] "quintessence of folly" [...] to believe that <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> should be placed on an equal footing with his white counterpart.|$|E
500|$|Much of Haywood's {{philosophy}} {{relating to}} socialism, {{to the idea}} that industrial unionism was preferable to craft unionism, what he saw as the evils of the wage system, his attitude about corporations, militia, and politicians, seem to have been held in common with his mentor at the WFM, Ed Boyce. Boyce also called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens. Unlike Boyce and many other labor leaders and organizations of the time, Haywood believed that workers of all ethnicities should organize into the same union. According to Haywood, the IWW was [...] "big enough to take in <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> the white man; big enough to take in all nationalities – an organization that will be strong enough to obliterate state boundaries; to obliterate national boundaries." ...|$|E

5000|$|On Tuesday, March 8, {{lawyers for}} several of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> filed writs {{of habeas corpus}} but DuBose quashed them. After news {{filtered}} out that the injured deputies {{were not going to}} die the tensions outside the jail seemed to abate and the Tennessee Rifles thought it was no longer necessary to guard the jail grounds, especially as the Shelby County Jail itself was thought to be impregnable. But, as Ida B. Wells would write in retrospect, the news that the deputies would survive was actually a catalyst for violence for <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>men</b> could not now be [...] "legally" [...] executed for their crime.|$|R
500|$|The erasure of DeVine {{from the}} {{narrative}} places the white female bodies {{as the only}} true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> as always already a perpetrator of crime." [...] Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, [...] "Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important {{and it is a}} crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from Boys Don't Cry, Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion." ...|$|E
500|$|Foraker was {{initially}} {{convinced of the}} guilt of the men, but reconsidered after evidence obtained in a private investigation by progressive organizations was presented to him (the black attorney presenting it was denied an audience with Roosevelt). [...] According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, [...] "Foraker had a passion for racial justice." [...] Recalling Foraker's desire, as a soldier, to see slavery abolished and <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> given the same {{civil and political rights}} as the white man, Morris explains, [...] "Senator Foraker merely felt the same about the Constitution in 1906 as Private Foraker had felt in 1862." [...] In addition to his desire to see justice done, Foraker also saw political advantage in opposing Roosevelt over the Brownsville issue; he might boost his own presidential ambitions for 1908 by making both Roosevelt and his designated heir apparent, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, look bad.|$|E
500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her {{pie-dish}} [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of this man is not clear. <b>The</b> <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} painting was set in a barbershop with patrons {{of a variety of}} religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a [...] oil on canvas depicting tolerance as [...] "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Patrick Chura, who {{suggests}} Emmett Till was a {{model for}} Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to {{the representation of the}} [...] "mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood". Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson {{as an example of the}} recurring motif among white Southern writers of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> as [...] "stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him". Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.|$|E
500|$|Steiger had {{intended}} {{returning to the}} stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night, opposite Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps {{to the conclusion that}} the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>man</b> he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named [...] "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with, remarking in 1995, [...] "He's so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had." [...] A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger's performance as [...] "outstanding", writing: [...] "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder." [...] Steiger won a plethora of other awards, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Laurel Award and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.|$|E
