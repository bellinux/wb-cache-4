500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
2500|$|The ex-governor and {{his family}} learned of the {{indictment}} while they were vacationing in Florida, near Disney World. Through his publicist, the ex-governor stated, [...] "I'm saddened and hurt, but I am not surprised by the indictment. I am innocent. I now will fight in the courts <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the ruling, Craig {{announced}} that despite his previous {{statements to the}} contrary, he would serve out his Senate term. [...] He stated {{that he intended to}} [...] "continue my effort <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> name in the Senate Ethics Committee—something that is not possible if I am not serving in the Senate." [...] Craig did not seek reelection in 2008 and left office on January 3, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk {{for a few moments}} to [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E

60|$|For {{many years}} now I have taken {{a part in the}} {{discussion}} of Socialism. During that time Socialism has become a more and more ambiguous term. It has seemed to me desirable <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> up <b>my</b> own ideas of social progress and the public side of my life by restating them, and this I have attempted in this essay.|$|R
25|$|INTERVIEWER: You don't {{feel that}} {{exploring}} {{the past is}} particularly relevant? I'm always trying <b>to</b> get <b>clear</b> in <b>my</b> mind {{how much of the}} past I need to consider when doing brief therapy.|$|R

60|$|In conclusion, I wish to state, {{by way of}} advertisement, {{that medical}} colleges {{desiring}} assorted tramps for scientific purposes, either by the gross, by cord measurement, or per ton, will do well to examine the lot in my cellar before purchasing elsewhere, as these were all selected and prepared by myself, and can be had at a low rate, because I wish <b>to</b> <b>clear,</b> out <b>my</b> stock {{and get ready for}} the spring trade.|$|R

6000|$|There {{are moments}} in a chappie's life, don't you know, when Reason, so to speak, totters, as it were, on its bally throne. This {{was one of}} them. The {{situation}} seemed somehow to have got out of my grip. I suppose, strictly speaking, I ought, at this juncture, <b>to</b> have <b>cleared</b> <b>my</b> throat and said in an audible tone, [...] "Harold, old top, I know where Ponsonby is." [...] But somehow I couldn't. Something seemed to keep the words back. I just stood there and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she! Obstinate about it. Leaves me <b>to</b> guess. It's <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mind, Mr. Gerard, that {{somebody}} has got {{at her in}} my absence, and said something to upset her. You will ask me who the person is. I can't say I have found that out yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Alv. It {{does not}} grieve me, that you hold me crazed; But, <b>to</b> be <b>cleared</b> at <b>my</b> dead master's cost, O there's the wound! {{but let me}} first adjure you, By all you owe that dear {{departed}} soul, No more to think of marriage with Almeyda.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] assented Willie, [...] "and now, old fellow, I'm off. Mr Tippet likes punctuality. I'll look in at {{the station}} in passing if {{anything}} turns up <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> mind on these matters; meanwhile good-bye." ...|$|E

60|$|Advancing {{from the}} high-road to the wood, I saw two persons {{at a little}} {{distance}} from me--a man in the dress of a gamekeeper, and a lad. I was too much agitated to take any special notice of them; I hurried along the path which led <b>to</b> the <b>clearing.</b> <b>My</b> presentiment had not misled me. There he lay, dead on {{the scene of the}} duel, with a blood-stained razor by his side! I fell on my knees by the corpse; I took his cold hand in mine; and I thanked God that I had forgiven him in the first days of my recovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "I make no promise, Ben-Ahmed. Yet this I may safely say, that I {{will not}} try <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> off on <b>my</b> own account.

60|$|Mont. How unsuccessfully I still o'ercome!

6000|$|... "Oh, no, Tom. I {{know you}} too well for that." [...] And now Nellie {{gave him a}} look that thrilled him through and through. [...] "But I think I ought <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> name before-- before I do {{anything}} else." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{this did}} not tend <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> mind much, and as I knew from {{experience}} that the worthy Celt refused to be hurried in his communications, I turned an inquiring look on Blondin, who at once said in French-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy rose. [...] "If {{one ever}} comes in my way, I shall try to profit by it. That is all I can say. I'm a little dazed, Eleanor. I think I'll {{go out and}} try <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>my</b> brain again. You won't mind? I hear Prescott." ...|$|E
5000|$|In addition, the centre's {{partners}} in the probation service and the police refer to the centre youths identified as being at-risk due to their home circumstances or their association with gang violence or religious fundamentalism. Such youths benefit from the structured environment, the new and challenging activities, {{and the presence of}} strong role models. They may go on to gain qualifications and even become instructors in their own right. As one put it: AHOY has helped me and my behaviour. I have started <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> up <b>my</b> life, started going back to school and not hanging around the 'mates' that always got me into trouble. 'Billie' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, fair cousin, and I {{altogether}} {{agree with}} you," [...] said the King, [...] "I being in fact {{more interested in}} the reputation of the good little town than you are--Peronne being, as you know, fair cousin, one of those upon the same river Somme, which, pledged to your father of happy memory for redemption of money, are liable to be redeemed upon repayment. And, to speak truth; coming, like an honest debtor, disposed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> off <b>my</b> obligations of every kind, I have brought here a few sumpter mules loaded with silver for the redemption--enough to maintain even your princely and royal establishment, fair cousin, for the space of three years." ...|$|R
2500|$|... …I {{find that}} the sense of racial {{solidarity}} is growing stronger and {{that the members of}} this tribe are cooperating more and more with each other with the object in view of promoting the mutual benefit of all the members.
