5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, {{and a desire to}} reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) {{to the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
5|$|Responding to the Japanese {{capture of}} part of the ridgeline, Major Odell M. Conoley—Hanneken's {{battalion}} executive officer—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a bandsman. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese back off the ridge, effectively ending Oka's attack. The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on the ridge and 200 more in the ravine in front of it. Hanneken's unit suffered 14 killed and 32 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Rouget's {{division}} and Paris' brigade apparently {{began to pull}} back after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and drive a wedge into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men across some marshy ground and then up the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to save {{all but two of}} its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's {{division and}} Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies.|$|E

5|$|The first castle {{built on}} the site was {{probably}} of an octagonal design, running along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> protected by square and semi-circular mural towers, with a barbican guarding the eastern entrance. It probably resembled White Castle, remodelled by de Burgh in the same period, or Bolingbroke and Beeston Castles, both built in the 1220s. The castle was built of Kentish ragstone and cemented by a mortar containing {{a large proportion of}} seashells, particularly cockleshells from the cockle beds of neighbouring Canvey Island. A valuable tidal watermill had been built by 1249, essential for making bread for the castle; recent archaeological work suggests that it was positioned on a wharf reaching out into the estuary just to the south-east of the castle. Terraced gardens were built along {{the south side of the}} castle overlooking the estuary, probably including vineyards.|$|E
5|$|The ridge {{fell under}} German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea, as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank {{each other through}} northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured {{the height of the}} ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E
5|$|Towards midday, the 79th Reserve Division {{was ordered}} to {{recapture}} the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack. However, {{it was not until}} 6:00pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack, clearing the Canadian Corps troops out of the ruined village of Vimy but not recapturing the third line south of the village. By night time, the German forces holding the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the mean time. Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by late evening portions of the 111th Infantry Division occupied the third line near Acheville and Arleux, with the remainder of the division arriving the following day.|$|E
40|$|Recently new quantum {{features}} were observed and studied in <b>the</b> <b>ridged</b> quantum wells (RQW). Periodic <b>ridges</b> on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum well layer impose additional boundary conditions on electron wave function and reduce quantum state density. As result, chemical potential of RQW increases and becomes <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> height dependent. Here we propose system comprising of RQW and additional layer on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> forming periodic series of p+-n+ junctions (or metal-n+ junctions). In such systems charge depletion region develops inside <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and effective ridge height reduces, becoming rather strong function of temperature T. Consequently, T dependence of chemical potential magnifies and Seebeck coefficient S increases. We investigate S in <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> semiconductor RQW having abrupt p+-n+ junctions or metal-n+ junctions on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges.</b> Analysis made on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> Boltzmann transport equations shows {{dramatic increase in}} S for both cases. At the same time other transport coefficients remain unaffected by the junctions. Calculations show one order of magnitude increase in thermoelectric figure of merit ZT relative to the bulk material.

50|$|One {{interesting}} local landmark is Whariti, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{peaks in}} the Ruahine Ranges near Woodville. The name {{appears to be a}} corruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original name Wharetiti (Whare - house, titi - muttonbird (the Sooty Shearwater)). According to an interview on Radio Woodville in 2009, <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> 920 m (2950 ft) gained its name when migrating muttonbird nested on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ruahine mountain range.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{developed}} during <b>the</b> 1850s on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> {{where there were}} natural prairies and oak savannas, which made working the land much easier. With <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> good roads, settlement remained along the Mississippi River where farmers could ship their grain on steamboats. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Rail from Winona, Minnesota allowed for development away from the river, and by 1890 farmers were transporting their goods predominantly by rail.|$|R
5|$|The only {{portion of}} the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, {{collapsing}} almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer {{of one of the}} assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench undamaged. Machine-gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down, wounded or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division's right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the south-western portion of Hill145 to withdraw but only after they had run out of ammunition, mortar rounds and grenades.|$|E
5|$|When it advanced, Brisbane's brigade {{came under}} {{artillery}} fire that caused many casualties. The brigade finally reached some dead ground where the guns could not hit them, but French skirmishers began picking off the soldiers. After some urging by Edward Pakenham, Brisbane continued the attack. The 1/45th Foot fought its way {{close to the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> where Joseph François Fririon's brigade of Foy's division held the ridgeline. On the left of Brisbane's brigade, the 1/88th Foot had two companies guarding the divisional artillery battery as it began pounding the French line. Soult spotted the threat and ordered a squadron of the 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval to charge. The cavalry overran the two companies, inflicting heavy losses, and then went after the gunners. The remaining companies of the 88th immediately opened fire on the French horsemen, mowing most of them down. The 21st Chasseurs went into combat 401 strong but 11 days later reported only 236 men on active duty. The 88th Foot suffered 269 killed and wounded, {{by far the most}} of any British unit.|$|E
5|$|Battle Abbey {{was founded}} by William {{at the site of}} the battle. According to 12th-century sources, William made a vow to found the abbey, and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died. More likely, the {{foundation}} was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070. The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey, and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle; the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> has also been built up and levelled. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbey's lands passed to secular landowners, who used it as a residence or country house. In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence. The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by English Heritage and are open to the public. The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle, perhaps to hang at the bishop's palace at Bayeux. In modern times annual reenactments of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle.|$|E

25|$|Marchand {{served under}} Ney again in Marshal André Masséna's third {{invasion}} of Portugal in 1810. He fought at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo from 26 April ro 9 July 1810 and the Siege of Almeida from 25 July to 27 August. On 15 September, Marchand's 1st Division consisted of Maucune's 1st Brigade, the 6th Light and 69th Line, and Marcognet's 2nd Brigade, the 39th and 76th Line. There were 6,457 men and 214 {{officers in the}} division. At the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September, Louis Henri Loison's division led the attack up the main road toward to <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Fighting its way through knots of British and Portuguese skirmishers, it was met at the crest by British infantry and artillery and defeated. Too late to support Loison, one of Marchand's brigades neared the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Because of hostile artillery fire it strayed {{to the left of}} the road.
