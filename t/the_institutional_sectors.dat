For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a production account), the balancing item, gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the production account by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use of income accounts exist for all <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors.</b> These accounts describe the distribution and redistribution of income and its use in the form of final consumption.

This analysis is very necessary, because the European Commission, through the specialized directorate - DGECFIN, has included in the forecast framework the indicators regarding incomes and expenditures of institutional sectors (compensation of employees, gross disposable income, gross saving) for member states.

To that end, we show that the principle of an institutional diversity associated with the organisation of R&D activities between these sectors can in fact be questioned.

The financial sector comprises i) the Eurosystem, i.e., the European Central Bank and the National Central Banks (ECB&NCB) of the nineteen countries that have adopted the euro in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) 8; ii) Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (MFI excl. ECB&NCB), i.e., the private banking system and money market funds; iii) Other Financial Institutions (OFI), such as saving and loan associations 9, credit unions 10, shadow banks 11, Islamic banks 12, etc.; iv) Investment Funds other than the Money Market Funds (Non-MMF IF); and v) Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds (IC&PF). The real sector includes i) Households and non-profit institutions serving households, such as charities and trade unions (HH); and ii) Non-Financial Corporations (NFC). Lastly, the non-financial public sector consists of General Governments (GG), while the sector Rest of the World (RW) includes the financial sector, the real sector and the non-financial public sector, at an aggregate level, operating in non-euro area countries, with an outstanding exposure to <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> operating in the euro area countries. <b>The</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> considered in our study with relative acronyms and definitions are summarized in Additional file  1 : Table SI 1.|$|E

40|$|The Housing Authority in Hong Kong {{provides}} around 30, 000 subsidized residential units per annum. It is {{the only}} major client in Hong Kong requiring prefabrication in its public housing construction, a policy {{which began in the}} mid- 1980 s. Recently, the government has started to promote prefabrication as a general principle to improve buildability, to increase quality and efficiency as well as to reduce construction wastes. However, an analysis of public tender results between 1988 and 2002 shows that the market appears to be less competitive in this housing <b>sector</b> than <b>the</b> other <b>institutional</b> building <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> former mainly consists of the construction of large residential housing estates with their auxiliary commercial centres and car parks, whilst the latter are non-residential purpose-built structures such as schools and police stations, though occasionally residential quarters are constructed for the disciplinary forces. During this 15 -year period, between 38 % and 74 % of the total annual public housing contracts, by value, were undertaken by only three contractors. Meanwhile in <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> building <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> range was between 24 and 61 %. This raises the concern that the prefabrication requirement might have raised the market entry barriers, and probably construction costs as well. This study addressed the competition issue by measuring and comparing the Herfinndahl-Hershamann indices (HHI) of the public housing and <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> building <b>sectors.</b> Regression analyses of the HHIs were then performed on various measures of contract values and a dummy variable representing the public housing or <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> building <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> analyses show that prefabrication, ceteris paribus, is not related to HHI. We conclude that the prefabrication requirement by itself {{does not seem to have}} raised the barriers to entry to prefabricated housing construction. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
30|$|The {{determination}} of disposable income by institutional sector {{allows us to}} find the final demand for consumption and savings. Therefore we can determine {{the closure of the}} model in each period, and the terminal closure condition as well. Disposable income can be allocated between final consumption and savings according to the intertemporal well-being function of each institutional sector. All <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sectors</b> maximize the present value of their intertemporal utility function, which can be interpreted as the well-being function (Prasad et al. 2004) depending on the final consumption expenditure and gross savings, subject to the lifetime budget constraint. The lifetime budget constraint is the lifetime disposable income that derives from the sum of compensation of primary factors plus net transfers and taxes to or from the other agents occurring in the secondary income distribution phase in each period.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to design {{policies}} for public and private education systems in the U. S.

Policy design is based on both traditional multiplier and Macro Multiplier approaches.

40|$|The aim is {{to design}} and {{evaluate}} balanced budget policies that reallocate federal funds from investments in national defence to the education system.

The latter is estimated by a cost-based approach {{on the basis of the}} changes in the production of human-capital related services. A suitable framework for conducting this kind of analysis is a dynamic extended multi-sectoral model. In this framework it is possible to account for direct, indirect and induced effects produced by the policy proposed. The observed results show that education expenditure is superior to defence expenditure. Indeed, reallocating federal funds from investment in national defence to the education system is convenient in terms of income, production activity and human capital accumulation...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of loans and deposits granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank loans and deposits and loans to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via loans and deposits, we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of loans and deposits granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by loans and deposits to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> Rest of <b>the</b> World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of loans and deposits by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the loans and deposits, such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>sector</b> receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank loans and deposits (4.48 trillion euros), loans and deposits granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), and loans and deposits granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R
