5|$|Because of William's {{impending}} {{retirement and}} the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize. On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall. After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged <b>telephonist.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions {{while working as a}} <b>telephonist</b> with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.|$|E

50|$|The AGSGNI {{became the}} Northern Ireland Civil Servants’ Association in 1950. It {{organised}} 64 branches across Northern Ireland, and although most remained geographically based {{a significant number}} retained a specialised nature, (e.g. <b>telephonists</b> and cleaners).|$|R
50|$|The ATS had {{its roots}} in the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC), which was formed in 1917 as a {{voluntary}} service. During the First World War its members served in a number of jobs including clerks, cooks, <b>telephonists</b> and waitresses. The WAAC was disbanded after four years in 1921.|$|R
40|$|Some {{unions in}} the United States have found labour-comomunity alliances an {{effective}} tactic for countering management's increasingly sophisticated anti-union strategies and declining union density. This article {{contributes to the}} literature on the use of such alliances in Australia by examining the exchange closure campaign of Telecom <b>telephonists</b> in Queensland in 1978. The <b>telephonists</b> had a strategic advan tage in using alliances with rural communities in their struggle against Telecom because it was a large public monopoly employer and because alternative courses of action to immediate exchange closure were available to it. This article suggests that the telephonists' tactic may have a wider applicability in an era of increasingly anti-union rhetoric and legislation, declining union density, and labour movement concerns over the public image of trade unions. 19 page(s...|$|R

5|$|The {{scene where}} Donna and the Doctor {{investigate}} Adipose {{was difficult to}} film. The scene took thirty shots to complete, and Tennant and Tate experienced problems avoiding each other on-screen. The scene was filmed in Picture Finance's call centre {{on the outskirts of}} Newport on an early Sunday morning, with the company's <b>telephonists</b> serving as extras.|$|R

At {{this time the}} staff comprised three postal assistants and four <b>telephonists.</b> Nine mails were despatched weekly to Perth and ten were received via a taxi service ("Miss Toodyay" [...] operating out of the Toodyay Garage) or by rail.|$|R
25|$|Nikolai Ilyich Usenko (Russia: Николай Ильич Усенко; 22 December 1924 – 21 March 1996) was a Red Army man and Hero of the Soviet Union. Usenko {{was awarded}} the title on 10 January 1944 for his actions during the Battle of the Dnieper in October 1943. During the battle, Usenko, a <b>telephonist,</b> was {{reported}} to have repaired numerous breaks in the line, often under German fire. He was also reported to have killed 25 German soldiers. Later he was seriously wounded and blinded by a German shell and medically retired from the Red Army. He subsequently returned to his home in Krasnoyarsk Krai and worked in the logging industry.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, he {{was drafted}} into the Red Army. He became a <b>telephonist</b> and {{was sent to the}} Northwestern Front as part of a ski brigade, which was merged into the 3rd Guards Airborne Division. Usenko served with the {{division}}'s 8th Guards Airborne Regiment from January 1943 on. He fought in the Demyansk Offensive from 15 to 28 February and the Staraya Russa Offensive from 4 to 19 March. In April 1943 the division was withdrawn into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. One month later it became part of the Central Front. In July, Usenko fought in the Battle of Kursk as well as the subsequent Operation Kutuzov as part of his division.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{communication between}} diver and attendant was by pulls on the diver's lifeline. Later a speaking tube system was tried, {{but it was}} not very successful. A small number were made by Seibe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the speaking tube was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted {{in the front of the}} helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface <b>telephonist,</b> but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to speak directly to each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, Draeger and others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, and has been technologically improved, but is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and full-face masks.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic tube {{headphones}} (also called pneumatic earphones or air earphones) {{are used}} especially in two-way radio. These are useful because a clear tube {{can be used}} to hide the earphones. They are also sometimes used for the microphone on <b>telephonists</b> headsets and to provide music to patients undergoing an MRI scan, as it would be dangerous to use metal wiring in the scanner's magnetic field.|$|R
25|$|During {{the advance}} in late August 1918, the battery's forward {{observation}} officer, Capt R.A.E. Somerville, found two abandoned German 7.7cm field guns near Marincourt. With {{the assistance of}} his <b>telephonists,</b> he turned one gun round and fired over 100 rounds at the retreating enemy, {{for which he was}} awarded a Military Cross. The two guns were sent home as trophies, one to the Durham RGA and one to the town of Sunderland.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recruits}} to the ATS {{were employed}} as cooks, clerks and storekeepers. At {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, 300 ATS members were billeted to France. As the German Army advanced through France, the British Expeditionary Force was driven back towards the English Channel. This led to the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk in May 1940, and some ATS <b>telephonists</b> were among the last British personnel to leave the country.|$|R
500|$|On 11 December 1916, Baker {{was engaged}} in battle with his unit near Gueudecourt. During the action, he was posted as a <b>telephonist</b> with the forward {{observation}} team sent to record {{the fall of the}} artillery and secure the range for a bombardment. Their position during this time was on a forward slope of the Australian frontline, which was subject to constant observation and the attention of German snipers. Attempting to maintain communications, Baker ventured out on four occasions during the engagement, each time subject to the heavy artillery barrage from the German forces, and repaired the telephone line in thirty separate places. As a consequence, the 16th Battery was able to align its artillery barrage and destroy the Germans' forward trench. Commended for his [...] "great gallantry" [...] as well as [...] "good service and... great devotion to duty", Baker was awarded the Military Medal. The announcement for the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 19 February 1917.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was very}} modest. If someone admired him, he was {{becoming}} and was taunting him. He had not servant or <b>telephonist</b> and if somebody had suggested him to employ one person he had said: «Imam Khomeini's life is simple than our life. We must live simply.» Ayatollah Khamenei about him said:«Although he was a popular scholar, {{but he was very}} modest,unassuming and sedately.» ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 June 1942, Bantsekin {{was drafted}} into the Red Army. He was {{initially}} assigned to the 380th Reserve Rifle Regiment. In February 1943, {{he was sent to}} the Central Front with the 109th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 37th Guards Rifle Division. Bantsekin joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He became a <b>telephonist</b> for the regiment and fought in the Battle of Kursk. During Operation Kutuzov, Bantsekin reportedly was completing the repair of telephone lines when he was surrounded by a 15-man German detachment. Engaging them in combat, he killed nine and caused the remainder to retreat on 9 August while on the outskirts of Dmitrovsk. [...] On 10 August, Bantsekin provided telephone communications from the company commander to the battalion commander during the repulse of German counterattacks. While repairing the line, he reportedly came under mortar fire twelve times.|$|E
50|$|Mr Gallagher was {{a member}} of the National Guild of <b>Telephonists</b> that the Post Office wish to {{derecognise}} in the process of changing into a public company under the Post Office Act 1969. It wished solely to recognise the Union of Postal Workers. Mr Gallagher claimed this would breach an implied term of his contract, based on what a trainer had told him when he started, namely that he was free to join any or no union.|$|R
50|$|Morris {{was perhaps}} {{the first person to}} analyze data on {{cardiovascular}} disease and activity. By performing a large scale survey, he first noticed in 1949 that the sedentary drivers of London's double-decker buses had higher rates of cardiovascular disease than the conductors who climbed the stairs. He extended the study and noticed that postmen who delivered the mail by bike or on foot had fewer heart attacks than sedentary men who served behind counters or as <b>telephonists</b> and clerks.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} Research Project {{into the}} Cost Effectiveness of Training, various {{experiments}} were held in Telephone Exchanges in the Midland, Eastern and London Telecomrnunications Regions. The purpose of the experiments {{was to investigate the}} work load of telephonists,to see how {{the amount of time spent}} on the elements of the task done might vary as the training of the <b>telephonists</b> proceeded and also to attempt to compare two methods of training. Data from these experiments and from other sources in the literature was used to compare the efficiency of a selection of models of learning. The method of comparison was based on an extension of an iterative 2 -parameter curve fitting algorithm which uses a Taylor Series approximation to the function of the model of learning investigated. The resulting analysis allowed a tentative choice of what might be called the "best" model, which was then used in a more detailed examination of further data obtained on <b>telephonists.</b> In the event, the curve fitting analysis was found to be complex, as was the apparently simple task of "telephonist", Time did not allow an extension of the study into other tasks performed by Post Office personnel...|$|R
2500|$|Charles Thomson {{was born}} in Romford, London Borough of Havering, East London, and educated at Brentwood School, Essex, {{where he was a}} classmate of Douglas Adams. While still at school, he {{organised}} mixed media arts events and contributed to Broadsheet, a magazine edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone and published by Artsphere, a school arts group. Outside school, he started the Havering Arts Lab. this resulted in a headline [...] "Sex Orgy Tale—Group Banned" [...] in the local Havering Express newspaper. In 1970 he produced a satirical magazine, called 'Lubricant', which ran for 10 issues. In 1971 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Dwarf candidate in the Havering council elections, and was involved in anti-pollution protests. He distributed [...] "underground" [...] magazines around London, including [...] "Schoolkids OZ". In 1975 he went to Maidstone College of Art, where he was the only person in ten years to fail the painting degree. 1979–87 he worked part-time as a <b>telephonist</b> and receptionist at Kent County Ophthalmic and Aural Hospital. 1987–99 he was a full-time poet, with work in over 100 anthologies.|$|E
2500|$|Fältskog {{worked as}} a <b>telephonist</b> for a car firm while {{performing}} with a local dance band, headed by Bernt Enghardt. The band soon became so popular {{that she had to}} make a choice between her job and her musical career. She continued singing with the Bernt Enghardt band for two years. During that time, Fältskog broke up with her boyfriend Björn Lilja; this event inspired her to write a song, [...] "Jag var så kär" [...] ("I Was So in Love"), that soon brought her to media prominence. At that time, Karl Gerhard Lundkvist, a relative of one of the band's members, retired from his successful rock and roll career and began working as a record producer at Cupol Records. Enghardt sent him a demo recording of the band, but Lundkvist only showed interest in Fältskog and her song. She was worried because he was not interested in the band and they were not to be included on the record. However, she decided to accept the offer, and signed a recording contract with Cupol Records.|$|E
2500|$|Women were [...] "drafted" [...] in {{the sense}} that they were conscripted into war work by the Ministry of Labour, {{including}} non-combat jobs in the military, such as the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS or [...] "Wrens"), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF or [...] "Waffs") and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). Auxiliary services such as the Air Transport Auxiliary also recruited women. In the early stages of the war such services relied exclusively on volunteers, however by 1941 conscription was extended to women for the first time in British history and around 600,000 women were recruited into these three organizations. In these organizations women performed a wide range of jobs in support of the Army, Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy both overseas and at home. These jobs ranged from traditionally feminine roles like cook, clerk and <b>telephonist</b> to more traditionally masculine duties like mechanic, armourer, searchlight and anti- aircraft instrument operator. British women were not drafted into combat units, but could volunteer for combat duty in anti-aircraft units, which shot down German planes and V-1 missiles. Civilian women joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which used them in high-danger roles as secret agents and underground radio operators in Nazi occupied Europe.|$|E
50|$|The rise of {{telemarketing}} can {{be traced}} back to the 19th century <b>telephonists,</b> or switchboard operators. Trans-cultural hiring of switchboard operators (mostly women) became especially popular in North America throughout the 20th century, partially due to popularity gained through advertising. After the shift from public switched telephone network to computer-based electronic switching system, the job of switchboard operators gradually diminished. However, with the rise of advertising and with the popularity of the telephone use, new jobs, including telemarketing jobs, were created.|$|R
