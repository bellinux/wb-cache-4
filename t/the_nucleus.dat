40|$|The {{embryo sac}} before a pollen tube reaches, and the embryo sac after a pollen tube reaches were {{observed}} in Tricyrtis hirta of liliaceaous plant. Before the pollen tube reaches the embryo sac, two polar <b>nuclei</b> inside <b>the</b> central cell fuse, and become one large diploid nucleus.

5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital.

5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> rather than a positron emitted from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus.</b> A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E

40|$|The present chapter {{describes}} the anatomical organization of <b>nuclei</b> of <b>the</b> thalamus, together with functions considerations. The chapter first discusses some general aspects of thalamic organization including functional subdivisions of the thalamus, the categorization of thalamic afferents as drivers or modulators, and reciprocity in thalamocortical relationships. The chapter then proceeds to individually discuss each of <b>the</b> major <b>nuclei</b> of <b>the</b> thalamus. This includes {{a description of}} their cellular properties and relative locations, their afferent and efferent connections, and their functions. The order of presentation is as follows: <b>the</b> lateral geniculate <b>nucleus,</b> <b>the</b> ventral posterior complex, <b>the</b> medial geniculate <b>nucleus,</b> <b>the</b> ventral anterior and ventral lateral <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> ventral medial <b>nucleus,</b> <b>the</b> mediodorsal <b>nucleus,</b> <b>the</b> submedial <b>nucleus,</b> <b>the</b> anterior <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> lateral <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> intralaminar <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> midline <b>nuclei,</b> and <b>the</b> reticular <b>nucleus</b> of thalamus.

5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. <b>The</b> <b>nucleus</b> maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave <b>the</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> by the electromagnetic force.

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E
