25|$|Characteristic of {{the country}} are the {{enormous}} fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water. They are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other cases the opposite walls of the gorges are but two or three hundred meters apart, and fall almost vertically thousands of meters, representing an erosion of many hundred <b>thousands</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of hard rock. One result of the action of the water has been the formation of numerous isolated flat-topped hills or small plateaus, known as ambas, with nearly perpendicular sides.|$|R
2500|$|Canada uses metric {{measure for}} {{internal}} trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, {{natural gas is}} sold by the gigajoule, cubic metre (m3) or <b>thousand</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic metre). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). [...] In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m3 or ft3), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these new plants was Imperial's Leduc {{facility}} (sometimes called [...] Imperial Devon or Imperial Leduc). It sweetened the gas with monoethanolamine (MEA), then extracted the liquid hydrocarbons by refrigeration. Northwestern Utilities Limited bought the gas at $14.12 per <b>thousand</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> and distributed it in Edmonton. Trucks transported the propane, butane and [...] "pentanes plus" [...] (the Canadian term for heavier gas liquids) until 1954, when three pipelines began moving the products from Imperial Leduc to Edmonton. When markets {{could not be found}} for the propane, the board occasionally granted permission to flare it.|$|E

5000|$|A cistern (Middle English , from Latin , from , [...] "box", from Greek [...] , [...] "basket") is a {{waterproof}} receptacle for holding liquids, usually water. Cisterns are often built {{to catch and}} store rainwater. Cisterns are distinguished from wells by their waterproof linings. Modern cisterns range in capacity from a few litres to <b>thousands</b> of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres,</b> effectively forming covered reservoirs.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{scientists}} {{have a different}} view, saying the [...] "dilution is the solution to pollution" [...] argument is no longer accepted in environmental science.

50|$|A large nickel mine {{located at}} Talvivaara leaked {{hundreds}} of <b>thousands</b> of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of tailings pond water containing toxic metals into the nearby environment in November 2012. The uranium {{concentration in the}} effluent rose by 100-200 times its normal level in the bottom and surface waters. Poisonous water leaked out at a speed of 5 000-6 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> an hour. The mine has leaked also in 2008 and 2010. As a result, environmentally hazardous concentrations of nickel, zinc, cadmium and uranium were reached in the local river, exceeding the permitted yearly maximum in the environmental permit {{by a factor of}} 50.|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of two controlled landfills in Tunisia {{was carried out}} for about 10 years by CITET and CWBI. Both landfills were managed by classical methodology i. e. disposal, compaction and, if any, biogas and leachate extraction and treatment. One of them is located near Tunis and the other near Sousse with a warmer climate. They received more than 6, 000 and 350 <b>thousand</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of MSW respectively from the two cities. Solid samples were collected by boring at different depths up to 18 m. They were analysed for dry weight and for total organic carbon, nitrogen and (hemi-) cellulose. The boreholes were equipped with 200 mm perforated PEHD tubes for further biogas and leachate sampling and analyses (COD, VFA, CH 4 content, …) at different seasons. The results indicate an efficient mesophilic anaerobic digestion in both landfills. The high dry weight content (70 – 92 %) of 13 solid samples collected in Sousse landfill contrasts however with the high leachate production in the Tunis landfill, filling about completely the majority of boreholes. The results of this monitoring confirm the trends formerly described about biological activity and environmental impact of landfills in Tunisia. Moreover a 200 L pilot-scale anaerobic digester was operated for about 3 years with solid wastes from Tunis landfill to assess the evolution of moisture content and organic matter...|$|R
50|$|This rock {{package was}} {{overthrust}} over younger layers of rock {{during the course}} of Alpine mountain folding. The main dolomite is brittle in places, but forms striking rock formations in places in conjunction with the forces of erosion.

This {{is due to the fact}} that the majority of the higher peaks are concentrated in the central and western part of the Allgäu Alps. The Hochvogel stands on its own in the eastern part of the mountain group; the nearest neighbouring summits are 200 to 300 metres lower.|$|R
50|$|Work {{commenced}} in 1887 {{and creating}} {{the island and}} fort required the sinking of 3,800 piles and the importation of 45 <b>thousand</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of sand. It took the Dutch eight years and ƒ 800,000 (€ 363,000) to construct the fort.|$|E

40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} of the wetland complex in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) are difficult to model, partly {{due to a lack}} of wetland morphology data. We used Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data sets to derive wetland features; we then modelled rainfall, snowfall, snowmelt, runoff, evaporation, the fill-and-spill mechanism, shallow groundwater loss, and the effect of wet and dry conditions. For large wetlands with a volume greater than <b>thousands</b> of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> (e. g. about 3000 m(3)), the modelled water volume agreed fairly well with observations; however, it did not succeed for small wetlands (e. g. volume less than 450 m(3)). Despite the failure for small wetlands, the modelled water area of the wetland complex coincided well with interpretation of aerial photographs, showing a linear regression with R- 2 of around 0. 80 and a mean average error of around 0. 55 km(2). The next step is to improve the water budget modelling for small wetlands...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the greatest water reservoirs in the ancient Roman world and, in particular, the “Piscina Mirabilis” in Misenum, in Southern Italy. In our study, we considered the reservoirs with a volume in the order of <b>thousands</b> of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres,</b> storing flowing water, set low in the ground or actually underground, and roofed over. In general, a Roman aqueduct was not built to provide drinking water, nor to promote hygiene, but either to supply the baths or for military aims. As a matter of fact, the population of Rome at the end of the 1 st century AD had an average water supply of 1, 550 L /d per capita especially used for baths. This circumstance required reservoirs of huge capacity. The reservoir of the Baths of Caracalla in Rome could contain over 80, 000 m 3 of water. The use of columns in a Roman reservoir was introduced in the ancient Constantinopolis and the Yerebatan Saray with a maximum capacity of almost 85, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> can be considered the biggest Roman reservoir. While for military aims, the Piscina Mirabilis in Misenum can be considered the biggest Roman resevoirs used for military aims ever known until now (provide the Classis Praetoria Misenensis) with a volumetric capacity of 12, 600 m 3 of water...|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} of the lakes (Lakes Chuya, Kuray, Uymon, Darkhat and others)achieved volumes up {{to hundreds of}} cubic kilometres, while the discharges of the outburstfloods reached millions of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> per second. These floods transformed thedrainage valleys, repeatedly building new sediment deposits. The dating of the latter provesthe occurrence of large-scale floods in the Chuya and the Katun River valleys in the intervalbetween 23 and 7 thousand years ago. During that period {{there were at least}} fivelarge-scale flooding events. Enormous water masses were drained simultaneously and repeatedlytoward the south of West Siberia. The total water volume out of the Altai basinsonly used to reach 10 <b>thousand</b> <b>cubic</b> kilometres.

5000|$|A special {{study of}} the {{geomorphology}} and palaeohydrology of the American scabland was begun by Victor Baker. It was Baker who mapped all main fields of giant current ripples known today in America, and {{it was he who}} made first attempts to gain chief hydraulic characteristics of the Missoula floods according to the multiple measurements of paired parameters of diluvial dunes and their mechanical composition. Some other so far known means had certainly been used for the purpose as well since Bretz's times, in particular, the functional dependences by Schezi and Manning. However, those dependences estimated velocities and discharges of the floods at the channel line, and the data received, although imprecise, were tremendous. V. R. Baker calculated the palaeohydraulic data over the ripple fields, i.e. over the sites distanced from the channel line and (or) on wane of the floods, where the current velocities of the diluvial streams admittedly must have been less than maximum ones (all the same, they were hundreds of <b>thousands</b> of <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> per second).For nearly sixty years the well-known ice-dammed Lake Missoula (and other well-known North-American ice-dammed lakes) and its cataclysmic outbursts was considered as a unique one in the world's scientific literature. Special tourist routes were organised at most impressive sites of [...] "giant vessels", canyons-coulees, vast fields of giant current ripples and others. Here professional guides tell the tourists about hydrospheric catastrophes which took place in the ice ages in America.|$|R
