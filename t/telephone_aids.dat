40|$|Abstract. SYNFACE is a <b>telephone</b> <b>aid</b> for hearing-impaired {{people that}} shows the lip {{movements}} of the speaker at the other telephone synchronised with the speech. The SYNFACE system consists of a speech recogniser that recognises the incoming speech and a synthetic talking head. The output from the recogniser is used to control the articulatory movements of the synthetic head. SYNFACE prototype systems exist for three languages: Dutch, English and Swedish and the first user trials have just started. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and objectives: The {{activity}} of behavioral inhibition and activation systems (BIS and BAS) has {{been related to}} several mental disorders. The availability of a validated questionnaire to assess BIS and BAS over the <b>telephone</b> could <b>aid</b> research.

Methods: A total of 231 participants were assessed with the SPSRQ twice (over the telephone and in a self-administered format). Intraclass correlation coefficients and kappa indices were calculated. Additionally, possible differences between the mean scores obtained with the two assessment procedures and internal consistency were explored.

40|$|This {{two-phase}} study {{assessed the}} cognitive strategies {{used by the}} elderly (individuals 65 {{years of age and}} older) and the accuracy of their estimates of reported dietary intake. In phase I of the study, we conducted interviews with 118 elderly respondents who were asked to “think aloud ” while estimating the portion size of solid, liquid, and amorphous (i. e., nonspecific) foods they had eaten the previous day. Respondents were given one of four sets of estimation aids, although most chose not to use these and appeared confident in estimating amounts. In phase II, 90 different elderly participants ate lunch at a university facility. Food items were pre-weighed or measured before being served, and amounts consumed were calculated after each meal. The following day, researchers interviewed participants by using one of three randomly assigned methods: by telephone with mostly 2 -dimensional <b>aids,</b> by <b>telephone</b> without <b>aids,</b> or in person with 3 -dimensional aids. Participants were asked to recall what they had eaten at the meal and to estimate the amount eaten. Findings from phase I suggested that elderly respondents generally chose not to use an aid to estimate portion sizes. For most foods consumed in phase II, those participants who used an aid did not have reduced estimation errors, because these commonly exceeded ± 25 percent. A n understanding of food consumption and the challenges associated with changing consumption patterns are critical to improving human health and wellbeing. One barrier to understanding consumption is the difficulty in measuring what people eat. Dietary recall studies, such as the Nationa...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the speech signal enhancement using Kernel Affine Projection Algorithm (KAPA) and Normalized KAPA. The removal of background noise is very important in many applications like speech recognition, <b>telephone</b> conversations, hearing <b>aids,</b> forensic, etc. Kernel adaptive filters shown good performance for removal of noise. If the evaluation of background noise is more slowly than the speech, i. e., noise signal is more stationary than the speech, we can easily estimate the noise during the pauses in speech. Otherwise it is more difficult to estimate the noise which results in degradation of speech. In order to improve the quality and intelligibility of speech, unlike time and frequency domains, we can process the signal in new domain like Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) for high dimensional to yield more powerful nonlinear extensions. For experiments, we have used the database of noisy speech corpus (NOIZEUS). From the results, we observed the removal noise in RKHS has great performance in signal to noise ratio values in comparison with conventional adaptive filters...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of consumer awareness of functional food ingredients for healthy food choices, {{the aim of this}} study is to explore consumers’ ingredient awareness and the determinants which influence the awareness about functional food ingredients. A sample of 200 German consumers was interviewed via CATI (computer <b>aided</b> <b>telephone</b> interview) during September 2011. The participants have been asked about their specific awareness regarding to ten functional food ingredients. Likewise, determinants like health status and health motivation have been assessed and their influence on the construct “consumers’ ingredient awareness” has been tested by employing structural equation modeling. The study shows that consumers’ ingredient awareness varies throughout the sample. Overall it can be stated, that 19 % of consumer awareness about functional food ingredients is explained through the described model based on the following predictors: age, educational level, health status, health motivation and information strategies. Among these factors, consumers’ health motivation seems to have the highest relevance to explain consumer awareness.

40|$|Flood loss {{modelling}} {{is associated}} with considerable uncertainty. If prediction uncertainty of flood loss models is large, the reliability of model outcomes is questionable, and thus challenges the practical usefulness. A key problem in flood loss estimation is the transfer of models to geographical regions and to flood events that may differ from the ones used for model development. Variations in local characteristics and continuous system changes require regional adjustments and continuous updating with current evidence. However, acquiring data on damage influencing factors is usually very costly. Therefore, it is of relevance to assess the value of additional data in terms of model performance improvement. We use empirical flood loss data on direct damage to residential buildings available from computer <b>aided</b> <b>telephone</b> interviews that were compiled after major floods in Germany. This unique data base allows us to trace the changes in predictive model performance by incrementally extending the data base used to derive flood loss models.

Additional data are useful to improve model predictive performance and increase model reliability, however the gains also seem {{to depend on the}} model approach...|$|R

Analysis by logistic regression was done separately for males and females. Results: The one year quit rate was 40 % (worst case assumption) – 55 % (best estimate). In 96 % of quitters an intensive counselling for 6 hours without pharmaceutical aid thereafter was sufficient to maintain abstinence for 12 months. A long smoking history or many earlier unsuccessful attempts to quit did not predict failure. The risk of relapse was found higher in young men with high number of pack-years and in women with good physical fitness but high Fagerstroem score and financial reasons for the intention to quit smoking. While an average weight gain of 3 kg in males was not associated with failure to quit smoking, we found the highest weight gain (4 kg) in females in the group abstinent at 3 months but smoking again at 12 months.

40|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} an {{important}} cause of premature death and morbidity, {{up to half of}} all lifetime smok-ers will ultimately die of a disease caused by smoking [1, 2]. Despite decreases in the last decades in the proportion of current smokers in Denmark and other industrialised countries [3, 4], smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease [1, 5]. Several studies have shown that smoking ces-sation has health benefits for people of all ages [6]. A Cochrane review and a meta-analysis find that proac-tive telephone counselling of smokers − with call back to people who have initiated the contact with the quitline − is effective [7, 8]. Reactive telephone counselling − with immediate response to smokers, who call to ask for assistance − may also lead to improved outcomes [9]. However, {{there are only a few}} European quitlines that have been evaluated for their cost-effectiveness, and as far as known, the only assessment of the cost-effectiveness of reactive tele-phone counselling of smokers in terms of the costs per life year saved (LYS), has been performed in Sweden.

Methods: The design was a telephone survey, stratified by state, using computer <b>aided</b> <b>telephone</b> interviewing, with households selected by random digit dialing from the telephone white pages. Setting was all Australian states and territories, 1, 621 regular tobacco smokers aged 18 + years. Measures were social and personal characteristics of tobacco smokers, smoking histories and patterns, and health status (SF- 8 and disability weights). Binary logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with current and lifetime chop-chop use. Results: Compared with licit-only tobacco smokers, current users of chop-chop had significantly greater odds of beginning smoking aged < 16 years (odds ratio [OR] 1. 65, 95 % CI = 1. 09 - 2. 50), of reporting below-average social functioning (OR 1. 61, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 2. 44), and of a measurable disability (OR 1. 95, 95 % CI = 1. 08 - 3. 51). Lifetime chop-chop users were relatively likely to be less than 45 years of age (OR 1. 82, 95 % CI = 1. 38 - 2. 39), report below-average mental health (OR 1. 61, 95 % CI = 1. 22 - 2. 13) and above-average bodily pain (OR 1. 40, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 1. 85), smoke more than 120 cigarettes/week (OR 1. 39, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 1. 83), and to have begun smoking aged < 16 years (OR 1. 33, 95 % CI = 1. 01 - 1. 75).
