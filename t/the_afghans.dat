5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against <b>the</b> <b>Afghans,</b> the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by <b>the</b> <b>Afghans.</b> Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E

This assault was defeated and the British launched a counter-attack the following day, however, they were unable to consolidate their position and as a result it was not until 17 May that the area was secured and <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> withdrew.|$|E

Regardless of casualties, the outcome of the Third Anglo-Afghan War remains contentious. Ostensibly, the result of the conflict was a British tactical victory. This is by virtue of the fact that the British repulsed the Afghan invasion and drove them from Indian territory, while Afghan cities were subjected to attack by Royal Air Force bombers. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> were ultimately able to secure their strategic political goals in the aftermath of the conflict.
