I've heard about this, but the Miley Cyrus persona you might have in America I don't have." [...] Her involvement with [...] "Decisions" [...] was originally not publicly acknowledged {{in an attempt to}} [...] "make a tune together that we're super happy about and just see people's real opinion about this." [...] However, Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted [...] "Yo check out Decisions me & @borgore new track" [...] in August 2012, which Borgore commented was [...] "super cool [...] she did it the way she did it". He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities, elaborating that [...] "I thought she was made up more to be a star, but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Broughton told The Independent on Sunday that he {{took the}} chance to educate himself while in prison, {{studying}} philosophy and social sciences with the Open University. [...] "I {{found a lot of}} sympathy inside," [...] he told the newspaper, [...] "but a lot of the general prisoners found it very difficult <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was inside for something I'd done for no personal gain." ...|$|E
2500|$|He stated that, despite Ministerial {{assurances that}} there were no {{politics}} in the UDF, a senior officer on his own staff had said to the Chief of the General Staff (at that time Lt-Genl Christiaan du Toit) in his presence: [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am 100 percent Nationalist, and that anything I am reputed to have said or done has been in the interests of my Minister." [...] When Brigadier Durrant had objected to this statement, the Chief of the General Staff ruled that such a declaration of politics could be made if so desired.|$|E

6000|$|I had sense enough <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{attempted}} <b>to</b> {{argue with}} the officer on {{the causes of the}} war I should speedily find myself in deep water, therefore I made reply: ...|$|R
2500|$|The mob {{led them}} into woods {{and stopped at}} a spring. It does not appear {{that it was the}} {{intention}} of all in the mob to kill them. James Faucett told them; [...] "I want you men <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the captain of this party, and that if we ever again find you {{in this part of the}} country we will hang you by the neck like dogs." [...] According to Clawson, after an hour of [...] "desultory conversation… of which the vilest accusations were laid against the [...] "Mormons," [...] the beastly talk of the mobbers," [...] three men who had left on horseback returned and directed Standing and Clawson to go with them.|$|E
2500|$|On {{two other}} {{occasions}} around this time, Van Gogh {{used the word}} [...] "arrangement" [...] to refer to color, {{similar to the way}} James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, [...] "As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better." [...] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: [...] "But this is enough for you <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, sir," [...] said Armand, {{a little}} bewildered, [...] "am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> hold myself at your {{disposition}} Mademoiselle Lange {{will be set}} free as early to-morrow morning as may be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Quiverful for {{a moment}} sat panic-stricken and silent. [...] "Am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{received}} no promise?" [...] he said {{as soon as he}} had sufficiently collected his thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will be {{your true}} husband {{for the rest of}} the journey;--by which I mean it <b>to</b> be <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> take you into {{partnership}} on equal terms, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am to be allowed to manage the business just as I please." ...|$|R
2500|$|Anselm {{held that}} faith {{necessarily}} precedes reason, but that reason can expand upon faith: [...] "And I {{do not seek}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may believe but believe that I might understand. For this too I believe since, unless I first believe, I shall not understand". This is possibly drawn from TractateXXIX of StAugustine's Ten Homilies on the First Epistle of John: regarding John 7:14–18, Augustine counseled [...] "Do not seek to understand in order to believe but believe that thou may understand". Anselm rephrased the idea repeatedly and Thomas Williams considered that his aptest motto was the original title of the Proslogion, [...] "faith seeking understanding", which intended [...] "an active love of God seeking a deeper knowledge of God". Once the faith is held fast, however, he argued an attempt {{must be made to}} demonstrate its truth by means of reason: [...] "To me, it seems to be negligence if, after confirmation in the faith, we do not study to understand that which we believe". Merely rational proofs are always, however, to be tested by scripture and he employs Biblical passages and [...] "what we believe" [...] (...) at times to raise problems or to present erroneous understandings, whose inconsistencies are then resolved by reason.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not wish}} it <b>to</b> be <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{in the habit of}} {{insulting}} ladies, but occasionally I have made an innocent mistake, and have met with some such response. The wrong waiter conveys to me precisely the same feeling of humiliation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{forgotten}} to apologise," [...] {{he said at}} last with extreme precision. [...] "Not being a gentleman yourself, you don't know apparently when you intrude upon a gentleman. I am one. <b>I</b> wish you <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> am in funds I don't work, and now..." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ethelberta paused before replying. 'Try to {{find out}} if--if he is much grieved at not seeing me, and say--give him <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will forgive him, Picotee.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{construction}} {{of your house}} being now completed, my duties as architect have come to an end.

6000|$|... "I {{have saved}} money all my life," [...] he confided eagerly. [...] "An uncle left me a little. Lately I have speculated--successfully. I don't want {{to dwell on}} this. I only wanted you <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> chose I could cut a very {{different}} figure--that my wife wouldn't {{have to live in}} a suburb." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawrence's {{face flushed}} {{and he made}} a step forward, but {{suddenly}} checking himself, he looked at the man {{for a moment and then}} said: [...] "I suppose you want me <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> become one of your subscribers in my own name, you will be willing to withhold the information you intended to give Mr Keswick." ...|$|R
6000|$|Some {{indication}} of his opinion was given, however, in a remark, {{which of course}} I pretended not <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> overheard him make {{to one of his}} officers: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lind's son {{eyed him}} dubiously {{for quite a}} long time. Then he said, slowly, [...] "Am I <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may now speak of the {{marriage}} as a recognized thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think {{anything}} injurious to the lady; but I do fear {{that she is}} in a position of much jeopardy, and that great care will be necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} signify in the least. I only want Lady Ushant <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> could {{possibly}} {{go to her}} I would rather do that {{than anything else in}} the world. Because Lady Ushant is kind to me I needn't expect other people to be so." [...] Reginald Morton was of course the [...] "other people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ha' {{answered}} {{you more}} than once already. Still, I tell you once again, since ye are slow <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was paid a matter of two hundred pound by your brother, Master Lionel Tressilian, to carry you off to Barbary and there sell you for a slave. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> plain to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I to help it? Well;--never mind. I won't let you {{sit there}} any longer. At any rate you'll be able <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never come to this place any more." [...] Clara, as she got up to obey him, felt that she also ought never to see it again;--unless, indeed,--unless-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} done," [...] said Clara, [...] "you {{may as well}} hear me for a minute. And I hope you will have sense <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really mean what I say." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} you <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> fail {{it will not}} be because I have not done all I can," [...] he said.

As you say, he is my friend." ...|$|R
