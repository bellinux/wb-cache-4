40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of a catalyticmembrane reactor (CMR), for partial oxidation ofmethane, mainly depends on the oxygen semi-permeation properties of the membrane and on its architecture. This paper presents the elaboration, by tape-casting lamination and co-firing process, of a membrane consisting of a crack free La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Fe 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 O 3 −ı (LSFG 8273) dense thin film supported by a porous layer. In the porous layer, gallium must be eliminated due to its cost. In order to avoid membrane cracking during the sintering and underworking conditions, the material of the porous supportwas chosen and adapted {{to have the same}} shrinkage during the co-firing and a thermal expansion coefficient similar to the dense membrane material. Two materials fulfil these conditions: La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 FeO 3 −ı (LSF 821) and La 0. 8 Ba 0. 2 FeO 3 −ı (LBF 821). Asymmetric membranes lead to an enhancement of the oxygen semi-permeation flux compared <b>to</b> <b>self-supported</b> membranes, with suitable mechanical properties in working conditions. The porous layer has a beneficial influence on oxygen semi-permeation of the membrane.

40|$|The present paper {{shows that}} Pherecydes’ {{theology}} {{is an important}} transitional stage in the complex process of gradual transformation of various mythological images into more sophisticated philosophical concepts. Three of Pherecydes’ highly enigmatic images are given special focus here: (1) the marriage of Zas with Chthonie and the embroidering of the robe, (2) the winged tree with the embroidered robe upon it and – nally – (3) the battle between Kronos and Ophioneus. This article argues that Pherecydes’ theology makes use of such common images as wedding, weaving, having wings and ghting to allegorically express more philosophical notions: the creation and arrangement of the world, the ability <b>to</b> <b>self-support</b> in space and the divinity of the rst principles. The allegorical nature of Pherecydes’ theology arises {{from the fact that}} his images retain their literal and concrete meanings {{while at the same time}} evoking more metaphorical and abstract senses. Thus, Pherecydes’ mythological images precede and pre gure philosophical concepts, although their gurativeness cannot be equated with our contemporary understanding of the term...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLeaves are {{the organs}} that {{intercept}} light and create photosynthesis. Efficient light interception {{is provided by}} leaves oriented orthogonal {{to most of the}} sun rays. Except in the polar regions, this means orthogonal to the direction of acceleration due to gravity, or simply horizontal. The leaves of almost all terrestrial plants grow in a gravity field that tends to bend them downward and therefore may counteract light interception. Plants thus allocate biomass for self-support in order to maintain their leaves horizontal. To compete with other species (inter-species competition), as well as other individuals within the same species (intra-species competition), self-support must be achieved with the least biomass produced. This study examines to what extent leaves are designed <b>to</b> <b>self-support.</b> We show here that a basic mechanical model provides the optimal dimensions of a leaf for light interception and self-support. These results are compared to measurements made on leaves of various giant monocot species, especially palm trees and banana trees. The comparison between experiments and model predictions shows that the longer palms are optimally designed for self-support whereas shorter leaves are shaped predominantly by other parameters of selection.

The one-electron redox systems studied are the reductions of Ru 3 + (hexaammineruthenium(III) /(II)), Co 3 + (cobaltocenium/cobaltocene), and Fe 3 + (hexacyanoferrate(III) /(II)). The mass transport (diffusion and migration) is simulated using the Nernst-Planck-Poisson (NPP) model, with good agreement between experiment and theory. The {{effect of the}} charge of the electroactive species on its mass transport to the electrode is considered when only small amounts of supporting electrolyte {{are added to the}} solution. The mass transport to the electrode is increased by "attractive" migration when a positively charged electroactive species is reduced or a negatively charged species is oxidized. Conversely, when a positively charged electroactive species is oxidized or a negatively charged species is reduced, the migration is "repulsive" and the mass transport to the electrode is decreased.

30|$|First, it is {{directed}} towards both an already-resident sponsor and a (would-be) entering spouse (or child), constituting a double conditionality. It measures and adjudicates who, among the former, {{deserves to be}} allowed to (re)establish and lead a family life. And it submits the latter – in Denmark and Norway – to a regime of local integration courses and programs. The deservingness of sponsors is evaluated in employment and ability <b>to</b> <b>self-support,</b> but also, in Denmark and Norway, and for some in Sweden after recent changes, the ability to support the spouse – a paradox in universalistic welfare states traditionally hostile to family dependency. In Denmark, and more recently in Norway, it also reflects the presumed maturity and independence which is associated with age (the 24 -year rule). It may further require the capacity to live an independent family life – in a suitably sized flat, away from in-laws, and even, in the former Danish point system, the potential for societal integration as signaled by not living in a “ghetto.” In Denmark, and now in Norway as well, a spill-over is also visible from the tightening of (language, waiting-period and employment) requirements for permanent residence status, which is required {{to have the right to}} import a spouse.|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{welfare reform}} {{initiatives}} {{are based on}} the assumption that the primary barriers to economic independence are individual deficits. However, the policy does not adequately account for situational and personal factors necessary for a successful transition from welfare to work. Without greater attention to these barriers, the policy is likely to fail or be implemented at high personal cost to recipients and their families. This paper uses a personin- environment social systems framework to examine the personal and family resources available to a group of women who were receiving AFDC and participating in an urban Head Start program. Structured interviews and literacy assessments with 77 AFDC recipientsp articipatingi n a Head Start program indicate that the barriers <b>to</b> <b>self-support</b> are not related to substance abuse, health problems, deficits in literacy, or a lack of interest in work. However, most caregivers do not have adequate training or education to prepare them to compete in the job market, nor do they feel equipped to find a job on their own. The results with respect to family resources are mixed. While families possess a number of coping mechanisms, caregivers have little support from social network members for day-to-day child care activities. The implications of the findings for welfare policy are discussed...|$|E

40|$|MA (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 A notable paucity in {{practice}} interventions and literature currently exists in regard <b>to</b> <b>self-support</b> in first-time mothers. Recent literature and practice interventions seem to focus largely on social support resources, highlighting the deficiency {{in the investigation}} of self-support in first-time mothers as an integral and holistic concept and/or focus point for intervention. Literature continues to illustrate the many challenges first-time mothers encounter and therefore this study focuses on self-support experiences of the first-time mother in relation to her environment by providing an original stance of enquiry. The investigator aimed to explore and describe the experiences of self-support in first-time mothers in the Cape Metropole. The study was conducted qualitatively and according to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) research design. This provided the researcher with a dual method of investigation: The first undertaking was to describe actual accounts of the participants‟ self-support experiences, while the second was to give an interpretation of these accounts which would reflect their experiences in an understandable, yet authentic manner. The meta-theoretical framework of Gestalt Therapy Theory (GTT) was applied due to its holistic and integrative nature, while the additional theoretical frameworks of Self Determination Theory (SDT) and Positive Psychology (PP) served as contributors to deepen understanding. The sample consisted of thirteen first-time mothers from moderately diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The study succeeded in giving in-depth exploratory descriptions of their self-support experiences during {{the first two years of}} motherhood. Findings displayed that the participants‟ self-support cannot be separated from their constantly shifting environments and that self-support is an integrated and dynamic process of development. Internal elements as well as environmental factors prove to disrupt this process of self-support development. Vital components for developing self-support were assuming responsibility for own well-being as a mother; as well as arriving at insight. Joy and gratefulness as experienced by the participants were proven to serve as motivators to sustain self-support. The study further exhibits that a supportive relationship is able to exist between the first-time mother‟s self-support and her environment when she is able to effectively identify, reach out and utilise social support resources available in her environment. Self-support serves as an experiential process (as an alternative to a fixed outcome) where the first-time mother is able, through experience, to mature and become more self-supportive. Findings argue that ideal self-support during novel motherhood is the capability to be in a mature interactive relationship with the environment, constantly adapting according to the organisation of the environmental field.

40|$|The {{single parent}} family in an inner city context is confronted with a {{problematic}} life situation. The demands, which are brought about by single parenthood as well as residence in an inner city environment, often lead to inappropriate parenting. The single parent child is often disrupted on an emotional and social level as a result. In many cases the child handles this disruption inappropriately. The {{single parent family}} {{has a need for}} resources in the community in order to ensure the continuous emotional, social, psychic and physical well being of its separate members. Involvement in gestalt group work can already be regarded as such an important resource available to the single parent child. Through this research study an investigation was made into the efficiency of a gestalt group work programme in the empowerment of the single parent child to handle the negative experiences of the single parent situation, such as feelings of guilt, anger, confusion, fear, inadequacy, loss, and sorrow and depression. Gestalt group work offers an opportunity to the child to share feelings and experiences regarding the single parent situation within the group context and to receive support from the therapists and other group members. This process strengthens the child’s inner self and the child is empowered <b>to</b> <b>self-support.</b> A complete and refined gestalt group work programme was developed and evaluated from the findings of a literature study and empirical study. The process of intervention research was followed during the empirical study. Data was obtained from seven single parent children in their late middle childhood years in an inner city context and their single parents. The combined quantitative-qualitative approach was used for this purpose according to the dominant-less-dominant model of Creswell. The single-systems design was used to test the effectiveness of the programme. The quantitative findings were obtained by self-developed questionnaires for the child respondents and their single parents, before and after the gestalt group work programme. The qualitative findings were obtained by unstructured observation during the gestalt group work sessions. According to the integration of the quantitative and qualitative findings, the conclusion can be made that the gestalt group work programme brought about an improvement in the child respondents’ emotional and social levels of functioning and their appropriate handling of feelings. The findings obtained, suggest that the developed gestalt group work programme can be implemented with confidence with single parent children in their late middle childhood years in an inner city context. Further research on the development and evaluation of a gestalt group work programme, specifically presented to the single parents, in order to guide and support them in the handling of their experiences of the single parent situation, is strongly suggested.
