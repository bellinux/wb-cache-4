5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other women}} {{claimed to have}} seen Sheridan {{engaging}} in group sex in a Glasgow hotel on another occasion. One of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{claimed to have been}} threatened by someone allegedly trying to protect Sheridan. <b>These</b> <b>witnesses</b> had attempted to sell their stories.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there were}} {{considerable}} discrepancies between different accounts, most {{witnesses to the}} accident had seen a [...] "streak of light" [...] that was unanimously described as ascending, moving {{to a point where}} a large fireball appeared, with several witnesses reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended toward the water. There was intense public interest in <b>these</b> <b>witness</b> reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. <b>These</b> <b>witness</b> accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the FBI's criminal investigation.|$|R
5000|$|Edgar's claims had {{the support}} of his {{brothers}} Alexander and David [...] - [...] Ethelred was Abbot of Dunkeld, and Edmund was divided from his siblings by his support of Donald [...] - [...] and his uncle Edgar Ætheling as <b>these</b> <b>witnessed</b> the charter at Durham.|$|R
25|$|Five {{independent}} {{witnesses were}} called to testify {{on behalf of the}} defense as to Collins' whereabouts on the dates Karen Sue Beineman had disappeared and her body had been found. Four of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> were employees of a motorcycle sales firm which Collins had visited on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance. Each testified on August 6. The timing of these four witnesses' recollections as to when Collins had actually entered the motorcycle shop varied slightly, although consensus among three of these men was that he had entered the premises as they were eating lunch, which they typically did anytime between one and two p.m. Upon cross-examination, the time factor of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> as to when they had actually seen Collins expanded to between noon and two p.m. Two of these employees had signed statements affirming the time Collins had entered their premises was approximately two p.m., although one of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> stated he had been repeatedly harassed by an Ann Arbor Police Sergeant as to the actual time he had seen Collins.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} unique vantage points or {{the level of}} {{precision}} and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest: the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard US Airways Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in Westhampton Beach, New York, and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach. Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> observed a missile; analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA800, but instead were consistent with <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.|$|E
25|$|His auditors’ discussions, which {{demonstrate}} neither insight nor pity, {{reflect the}} indifference of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses.</b> Even Bertrand, {{who at the}} start was at least willing to review the evidence, loses patience and, bored stiff, starts to adopt the same dismissive tone as Morvan had from the very start.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of modern theories, {{with a view}} to determining how far <b>these</b> <b>witness</b> (a) to the modification of the orthodox Christian doctrines {{in the light of the}} general theory of evolution, and (b) to attempts to vindicate these doctrines in the light of that theory, together with a restatement of the doctrines in the light of the foregoing examination...|$|R
2500|$|Investigators also {{gathered}} numerous witness statements attesting to a {{group of}} white men in a turquoise 1957 Chevrolet who had been seen near the church {{in the early hours of}} the morning of September 15. <b>These</b> <b>witness</b> statements specifically indicated that a white man had exited the car and walked towards the steps of the church. (The physical description of the individual who had exited the car varied, and could have matched either Bobby Cherry or Robert Chambliss.) ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{investigators}} from the NTSB arrived on scene the following day, many {{witnesses to the}} accident had seen a [...] "streak of light" [...] that was usually described as ascending, moving {{to a point where}} a large fireball appeared. There was intense public interest in <b>these</b> <b>witness</b> reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. Consequently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation.|$|R
25|$|In July 1952, after a {{build-up}} {{of hundreds}} of sightings over the previous few months, a series of radar detections coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C. (see 1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident). Future Arizona Senator and 2008 presidential nominee John McCain is alleged {{to be one of}} <b>these</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Joseph Smith, Sr. and Cowdery's father, William, {{may have}} been members of a Congregationalist sect known as the New Israelites, {{organized}} in Rutland County, Vermont. The Cowdery family lived in Rutland County in the early 19th century and later attended a Congregationalist church in Poultney, Vermont. Witnesses from Vermont connected William Cowdery to the sect before <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> could have known that his son, Oliver, was a dowser.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of references, again either explicit or implicit, to the text, especially during earliest times {{by those who}} had access to reliable sources now lost. Explicit references would be mentioning the text or letter by name, or a recognizable form of that text. Examples include a list of accepted biblical books, such as the Muratorian fragment, or the contents of an early manuscript, such as Papyrus 46. Unfortunately, <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> are often either damaged or too late in date to provide much help.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, we {{developed}} an approach for automated termination proofs of Java Bytecode (JBC), {{which is based}} on constructing and analyzing termination graphs. These graphs represent all possible program executions in a finite way. In this paper, we show that this approach {{can also be used to}} detect non-termination or NullPointerExceptions. Our approach automatically generates witnesses, i. e., calling the program with <b>these</b> <b>witness</b> arguments indeed leads to non-termination resp. to a NullPointerException. Thus, we never obtain “false positives”. We implemented our results in the termination prover AProVE and provide experimental evidence for the power of our approach. ...|$|R
50|$|Sexual assault {{is a crime}} {{defined as}} sexual contact upon a person or persons unwillingly, by means of force, {{physical}} threat, and abuse of authority which often leads to the victim or victims of the crime fearing to seek justice, and the fear is instilled by the same means in which the act was opposed on the person or persons. Sexual Assault includes: Rape; Indecent Assault; Attempts to commit <b>these</b> acts; <b>Witnessing</b> <b>these</b> acts and not reporting them.|$|R
25|$|In July 2015 Adamcik {{gained a}} hearing for post-conviction relief with state Sixth District Magistrate Judge Mitchell W. Brown. He claimed that {{testimony}} from character witnesses could {{have changed the}} outcome of the sentencing, but that his former attorney, against Adamcik's parents' wishes, chose not to call upon <b>these</b> <b>witnesses.</b> Adamcik said that his attorney believed that the prosecution would have submitted even more damaging evidence. In March 2016 Judge Brown denied his request for post-conviction relief. Adamcik is appealing Judge Brown's decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. A hearing will be held on November 9, 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitive}} and unanimous results {{produced by}} the 2011 Chilean judicial investigation appear to have laid to rest decades of nagging suspicions that Allende might have been assassinated by the Chilean Armed Forces. But public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing {{for much of the}} previous decade. In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers. The cumulative weight of the facts reported by <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> provided factual support for many previously unconfirmed details relating to Allende's death.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its earlier}} involvement, the Discovery Institute was {{concerned}} {{that this would be}} a test case and that the defendants had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions– William A. Dembski, Stephen C. Meyer and John Angus Campbell. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> to have their own attorneys present during deposition, but Discovery Institute director Bruce Chapman later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).|$|E
5000|$|As the {{translation}} neared completion, Smith revealed that three {{men would be}} called as special witnesses {{to the existence of}} the golden plates. Harris, along with Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, was chosen as one of <b>these</b> Three <b>Witnesses.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{program of}} the Afro-Asian Games was almost {{the same as that}} of the Asian Games, the only {{difference}} being in the number of sports. <b>These</b> Games <b>witnessed</b> eight disciplines in eight sports. Synchronised swimming and diving were not contested.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of surface {{characterizations}} of niobium (Nb) samples electropolished together with a single cell superconducting radio-frequency accelerator cavity. <b>These</b> <b>witness</b> samples were located in three regions of the cavity, namely at the equator, the iris, and the beam pipe. Auger electron spectroscopy was utilized to probe the chemical composition of the topmost four atomic layers. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray for elemental {{analysis was used to}} observe the surface topography and chemical composition at the micrometer scale. A few atomic layers of sulfur (S) were found covering the samples nonuniformly. Niobium oxide granules with a sharp geometry were observed on every sample. Some Nb-O granules appeared to also contain sulfur...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of Hermann Bock, several friends of his testified at Haarmann's trial that, prior to Haarmann's arrest, they had been {{actively}} dissuaded from filing a missing person report upon the youth with police; <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> testified that Haarmann was insistent on filing the report himself (he had never done so). Other witnesses testified to having acquired various personal possessions belonging to the youth from Haarmann. In addition, a tailor testified at Haarmann's trial to having been asked by Haarmann to alter the suit. Haarmann repeatedly contradicted himself regarding his claims as to how he had acquired the youth's possessions. It is likely that Haarmann chose to deny this murder due to evidence suggesting the murder had been premeditated, {{as opposed to being}} committed in the throes of passion. He had known the youth for several years prior to his murder, and Bock was known to be heterosexual. Due to his denial of having committed this particular murder, Haarmann was acquitted.|$|E
500|$|At {{the trial}} in May 1979, the prosecution's case {{depended}} heavily on the evidence of Scott, of Thorpe's former parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell, and of the hired gunman, Andrew Newton. None of <b>these</b> <b>witnesses</b> impressed the court; Bessell's credibility was undermined by the revelations of his financial arrangements with The Sunday Telegraph. In his summing-up the judge was scathing [...] about the prosecution's evidence, and all four defendants were acquitted. Nevertheless, Thorpe's public reputation was damaged irreparably by the case. He had chosen not to testify at the trial, which left several matters unexplained amid public disquiet.|$|E
500|$|In another incident, eight {{witnesses}} {{reported the}} recapture {{of a young}} woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. <b>These</b> <b>witnesses</b> were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, [...] "I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia." [...] Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named [...] "N" [...] at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded.|$|E
