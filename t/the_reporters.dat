She {{attracted the attention of}} <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1903– A {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Atlantic City as an 80mph (129km/h) hurricane, {{making it}} the most recent (until 2011) hurricane to directly strike the state. Dubbed by the Atlantic City Press as the Vagabond Hurricane, the storm gathers media interest from Philadelphia and New York, with one newspaper offering $200,000 (1903USD) to aid the survivors. When <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> arrive at the coast, they are disappointed {{at the lack of}} damage, which is confined to loose boards along the boardwalk. The storm's strong surf destroys several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. His heavy {{drinking}} had charmed <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem.

50|$|Then {{the teams}} come {{together}} for {{the final stage of}} the tournament, and present their solutions in the format of Physics Fights. During a Physics Fight each team consequently acts as a reporter, an opponent and a reviewer. The opponent challenges <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> for one of <b>the</b> problems. <b>The</b> <b>reporter</b> has <b>the</b> right to reject some problems, but then accepts the challenge. One or two representatives of <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> team make a 9-minute report on the solution of the accepted problem. Then a representative of the opponent team opposes the solution (analyses its advantages and disadvantages), and a representative of the reviewer team does a review (analyses the form of the report and the review, and the discussion between <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> and <b>the</b> opponent). <b>The</b> <b>reporter,</b> <b>the</b> opponent and the reviewer conduct polemics on the proposed report. Jurors ask clarifying questions to <b>the</b> <b>reporter,</b> <b>the</b> opponent and the reviewer, and put marks for their work. The jury usually consists of the university faculties and scientists. Watching the timetable and moderating the discussion is entrusted to the chairperson.|$|R

The hitman explains that <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> has also contracted the virus through her contact with one of the targets, and <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> ultimately decides to sacrifice herself to spare humanity from the disease. The hitman corrects <b>the</b> <b>reporter,</b> he has not been vaporizing the targets, merely teleporting them off Earth where the disease is not fatal.

5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} and pretended to be unconscious. <b>The</b> <b>reporters</b> were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed down {{and said that they}} would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and the media were banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban and be able to report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign.

Chris, the Princess's other bodyguard, came out and had a little feud with Tenkōji. The Princess eventually came out, and greeted everyone around her. When Mayumi introduced herself to Clara, <b>the</b> weird <b>reporter</b> reappeared and asked a perverted question towards the Princess. In the mist of all this, an assassin ran up and attempted to kill the princess, but was stopped by Tenkōji, Chris, and <b>the</b> <b>reporter.</b> Though <b>the</b> assassin was injured, he still managed to take <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> hostage, which caused <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> to joke about this situation.

5|$|Beginning at 8:00 the {{following}} day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, {{she had the}} town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5½hours). Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement.

5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
5|$|The Bratvaag {{left the}} island to {{continue}} its scheduled hunting and observations, {{with the intent of}} coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, Norway, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on September 5 in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frankel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Tromsø on September 2 and 16, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on October 5.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of <b>the</b> <b>reporters,</b> who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
