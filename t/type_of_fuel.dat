5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} basics of fuel combustion, no matter what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> system is used on a given engine, the carburetor's sole job is to provide exactly the correct amount of finely {{atomized}} fuel into a given amount of air that is entering the engine. To be burnable, the {{air to fuel ratio}} must be within the flammability limits of between nine and sixteen pounds of air to one pound of fuel (for gasoline engines). Above or below this ratio, the fuel will not burn.|$|E
25|$|Pyrolysis oil {{is another}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> {{derived from the}} {{lignocellulosic}} fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (pyrolysis), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors. This same reaction is known to have come from harvesting unicorn blood (although very hard to find).|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{moderate}} temperature requirements and compatibility with several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> SAFCs can be utilized in remote locations where other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells would be impractical. In particular, SAFC systems for remote {{oil and gas}} applications have been deployed to electrify wellheads and eliminate the use of pneumatic components, which vent methane and other potent greenhouse gases straight into the atmosphere. A smaller, portable SAFC system is in development for military applications that will run on standard logistic fuels, like marine diesel and JP8.|$|R
25|$|With the {{configuration}} finalized, NASA turned {{its attention to}} mission profiles. Despite some controversy, a lunar orbit rendezvous for the lunar module was chosen over an Earth orbital rendezvous. Issues such as <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> injections, the needed amount of fuel for such a trip, and rocket manufacturing processes were ironed out, and the designs for the Saturn V were selected. The stages were designed by von Braun's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, and outside contractors were chosen for the construction: Boeing (S-IC), North American Aviation (S-II), Douglas Aircraft (S-IVB), and IBM (Instrument Unit).|$|E
25|$|The UCS {{explained}} that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid (PHEV) {{was not included in}} the evaluation even though the Volt could have been compared with the Chevrolet Cruze as the conventional similar. The reason for the exclusion is that PHEVs are affected by a variety of factors that affect their environmental performance, such as the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> used (coal, wind, solar, etc.) for generating electricity to charge the vehicle, and also by the driving habits, including how often the vehicle is plugged in and the number of miles driven on electricity-only mode.|$|E
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> required. The filler pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} energy from {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> depends on the stoichiometric ratio, the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> and its specific energy, the energy per unit mass.|$|R

25|$|Proton-exchange {{membrane}} fuel cells, {{also known}} as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells (PEMFC), are a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cell being developed mainly for transport applications, {{as well as for}} stationary fuel-cell applications and portable fuel-cell applications. Their distinguishing features include lower temperature/pressure ranges (50 to 100°C) and a special proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. PEMFCs generate electricity and operate on the opposite principle to PEM electrolysis, which consumes electricity. They are a leading candidate to replace the aging alkaline fuel-cell technology, which was used in the Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or industrial furnace and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the hybrid}} {{strategies}} described above, using captive hydrogen to generate other more easily usable fuels, {{might be more}} effective than hydrogen-production alone. Short term energy storage (meaning the energy is used not long after it has been captured) may be best accomplished with battery or even ultracapacitor storage. Longer term energy storage (meaning the energy is used weeks or months after capture) may be better done with synthetic methane or alcohols, which can be stored indefinitely at relatively low cost, and even used directly in some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells, for electric vehicles. These strategies dovetail well with the recent interest in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or PHEVs, which use a hybrid strategy of electrical and fuel storage for their energy needs.|$|E

25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, {{there are two types}} of fuel. The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} a large amount of energy and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, then it becomes a fissile isotope by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary gas engines, rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E
25|$|In , Nigel Mansell was not retained, Williams favouring Coulthard {{over him}} to partner Hill. Schumacher, whose Benetton team had {{switched}} engine suppliers from Ford to Renault in the off-season, {{won the first}} round in Brazil, with Coulthard taking second. However, both were disqualified from the race after {{it was found that}} Elf supplied their teams with a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> for which samples had not been provided to the FIA. Thus, Gerhard Berger and Ferrari were declared winners. Schumacher and Coulthard had their positions reinstated after appeal, though Benetton and Williams were not awarded their constructors' points. Hill won the next two races in Argentina and San Marino and would later win races at The Hungaroring and in Adelaide. Hill won two laps ahead of the field at Adelaide in one of F1's most dominating victories. Coulthard recorded his only 1995 win for the Williams team at Estoril, before moving to McLaren.|$|E
30|$|The first micro data {{study on}} {{substitution}} between energy and non-energy factors {{was conducted by}} Woodland (1993). He used repeated cross-sectional data of approximately 10, 000 manufacturing firms in New South Wales, Australia, covering the period from 1977 to 1985. Woodland focused on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> (coal, oil, gas, and electricity) as well as labor and capital. He found that the demand for energy fuels is price-elastic (with the exception of coal), whereas the demand for capital and labor is price-inelastic. Moreover, he shows that substitution between fuels and the non-energy factors appears to be much stronger than substitution between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
