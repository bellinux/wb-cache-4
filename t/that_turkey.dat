The country joined the Partnership for Peace in 1995, and commenced its Membership Action Plan in 1999, {{at the same time}} as Albania. Participating in the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, it received aid from NATO in dealing with refugees fleeing from Kosovo. In August 2001, NATO intervened in the 2001 insurgency, during which a rebel Albanian group, the National Liberation Army, fought government forces. In Operation Essential Harvest, NATO troops joined with the Macedonian military to disarm rebel forces following a cease-fire agreement.|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{has played}} the most {{important}} role in stimulating political change in post-World War II Europe. Turkey had to become more democratic in order to attain candidacy for EUmembership {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s, and when it became a candidate, it had to adopt sweeping political reforms in order to fulfil the EU’s accession criteria so that accession negotiations could begin. Thus, this article proposes <b>that</b> <b>Turkey’s</b> EU candidacy since 1999 has stimulated Turkish political and legal reforms and intensified the Europeanization process in Turkey.

40|$|The {{wild turkey}} (Meleagris gallopavo) is an {{invasive}} species currently causing heated debate in California. Not {{only is there}} a {{question as to whether}} or not the bird is actually invasive, as a very similar species of wild turkey was present in California about 10, 000 years ago, but there is considerable dissent over whether or not turkeys actually cause any ecological damage. I conducted this study under the auspices of the California State Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) in order to address the potential impact of wild turkeys on habitat selection in native ground-dwelling avifauna, using the California quail (Callipepla californica) as the basis for comparison. Results show <b>that</b> both <b>turkeys</b> and quail are significantly selective about their preferred habitat types (p < 0. 01). Results also demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>turkeys</b> and quail are coexisting within the same macrohabitat types without significant detrimental effects on either bird. The birds utilize very different microhabitat types, and given the size difference between them, it is highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>turkeys</b> will begin to occupy the dense, bushy vegetation preferred by quail. Turkeys also appear to have narrower preferences for both microhabitat an...|$|R
