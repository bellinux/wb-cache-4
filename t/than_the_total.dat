5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If {{both sides have}} completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E

5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of bronze medals is greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in four sports: boxing, judo, karate and wrestling. In the women's 50m {{freestyle}} event of swimming, a tie for the second position between two swimmers from Italy meant that two silver medals (and no bronze) were awarded.|$|E

In the 2000 Census, 9.2million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent. Ulster's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent, and {{it is estimated that}} there are more than 27million descendants of the Scots-Irish migration now living in the US. In Canada, the Scottish-Canadian community accounts for 4.7million people. About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the United States, Hurricane Carol caused $461million in damage, {{mostly in}} New England, {{making it the}} costliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} at the time. There were 65deaths in New England, and about 1,000injured people. Despite the high damage, advance warning allowed for many fewer deaths <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> of 488fatalities during the 1938 New England hurricane, which affected the same area with similar strength. However, some areas did not receive advance warning, due to power outages preventing people from receiving Weather Bureau warnings ahead of the storm.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals is greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for {{second place in the}} parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{dramatically}} {{expanded the}} college during his tenure, {{both in terms}} of headcount and academic diversity. Enrolment grew from 1,089students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45programs. There were 94graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number of graduate students had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80new faculty members were hired, a number larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of faculty members a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for junior and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the University System of Georgia's first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate Ward B. Pafford) was appointed in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{are awarded}} in each weight class. Therefore, {{the total number}} of bronze medals is greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of gold or silver medals. An {{exception}} was the men's 84kg Greco-Roman wrestling, where Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his medal due to his conduct during the medal ceremony. Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 100 metres in athletics and no bronze was awarded. Ties for third in swimming's men's 100 metre backstroke and men's 100 metre freestyle meant that two bronze medals were awarded for those events.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda {{also has}} a strong history of {{communist}} sympathy, with the Rhondda Socialist Society being {{a key element in}} the coalition that founded the Communist Party of Great Britain. By 1936 there were seven Communists on the Rhondda Urban District Council and was publishing its own Communist newspaper The Vanguard. In the 1930s Maerdy became such a hotspot of Communist support it was known as Little Moscow producing left wing activists such as Merthyr born Arthur Horner and Marxist writer Lewis Jones. The Rhondda miners were also active in socialist activities outside the valleys. In the 1920s and 1930s the Rhondda and the surrounding valleys provided the principal support of some of the largest hunger marches, while in 1936 more Rhondda Federation members were serving in Spain as part of the International Brigades <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of volunteers from all the English coalfields.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
