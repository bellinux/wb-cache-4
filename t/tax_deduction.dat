5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> and a robust state <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

40|$|Owner-occupied housing {{benefits}} from several forms of tax preference in the United States. The non-taxation of implicit rental value, deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes, and capital gains preferences are all specific forms of housing tax preferences. The {{purpose of this}} dissertation is threefold: (1) to investigate the relationship theoretically as well as empirically between homeowner tax preferences, in particular, nominal mortgage interest and property <b>tax</b> <b>deductions,</b> and housing demand, (2) to examine empirically the vertical equity consequence of removing housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions,</b> (3) to develop an interval estimate {{of the change in}} Suits Indices between the current federal income tax and an alternative income tax that excludes housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> to test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect of eliminating housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions.</b> ^ In this dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for housing demand to analyze the impact of housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> on the demand for housing. A comparative static result is derived and it indicates that the housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> have an ambiguous effect on housing demand. A deterministic simulation of the effect of housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> on housing demand is performed using time series data for the period 1974 - 1993. Simulation results reveal that housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> have positive influences on housing demand. ^ I also simulate the effect of housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> on net per capita single family housing expenditure utilizing a linear expenditure system for housing demand. Simulation results reveal a direct relationship between housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> and housing demand. ^ I am able to assess both the non-revenue and revenue neutral vertical equity effects of removing housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions.</b> Results in both cases show that eliminating housing <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> increases the vertical equity of the tax system. ^ I then test the significance of the estimated vertical equity effect using both the bootstrap-t and percentile methods. The results reveal that the estimated vertical equity effect is statistically significant. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent work {{emphasizes}} the efficiency costs of <b>tax</b> <b>deductions</b> that distort {{the pattern of}} household spending. Using evidence on the sensitivity of taxable income to tax rates, this work suggests that the marginal welfare cost (MWC) of income taxes in the United States could be dramatically higher because of <b>tax</b> <b>deductions,</b> and might exceed unity. This paper develops an alternative approach for assessing the MWC using evidence on underlying parameters (e. g., labor supply elasticities, the demand elasticity for tax-favored goods).

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home mortgage interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner.

While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E

25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxesâbelieving this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises.

25|$|The {{healthcare}} reform {{debate in the}} United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. Following the election of Barack Obama as president, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. However, {{in the next election}} of Donald Trump as president, he campaigned to repeal and replace Obamacare {{and came up with a}} seven-point plan for {{healthcare reform}}. With this seven point plan President Trump discussed that the healthcare system would work based on free market principles. According to Ballotpedia, he stated that he would repeal Obamacare, reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance, institute a full <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> for insurance premium payments for individuals, make Health Saving Accounts inheritable, require price transparency, block-grant Medicaid to the states, and allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers. Trump added that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, this seven point plan has not taken the place of Obamacare, and it is possible that Obamacare will not be repealed but instead it will be modified so that all parts of this plan work accordingly.|$|E
