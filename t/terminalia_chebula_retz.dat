40|$|Abstract Background Tannins {{extracted}} from immature fruits of <b>Terminalia</b> <b>chebula</b> Fructus <b>Retz.</b> are considered as effective components promoting {{the process of}} wound healing. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the optimal extraction and purification technology (OEPT) of tannins, while studying the use of this drug in the treatment of a cutaneous wound of rat as well as its antibacterial effects. Methods The content of tannin extracts was measured by the casein method, and antibacterial ability was studied by the micro-dilution method in vitro. In wound healing experiment, animals in group Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ were treated with vaseline ointment, tannin extracts (tannin content: 81 %) and erythromycin ointment, respectively (5 mg of ointment were applied on each wound). To evaluate the process of wound healing, selected pharmacological and biochemical parameters were applied. Results After optimal extraction and purification, content of tannin extracts was increased to 81 %. Tannin extracts showed the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella Pneumonia in vitro. After excision of wounds, on days 7 and 10, the percent of wound contraction of group Ⅱ was higher than that of group Ⅰ. After being hurt with wounds, on days 3, 7, and 10, the wound healing quality of group Ⅱ was found to be better than that of group Ⅰ in terms of granulation formation and collagen organization. After wound creation, on day 3, the vascular endothelial growth factor expression of group Ⅱ was higher than that of group Ⅰ. Conclusion The results suggest that tannin extracts from dried immature fruits of <b>Terminalia</b> <b>chebula</b> Fructus <b>Retz.</b> can promote cutaneous wound healing in rats, probably resulting from a powerful anti-bacterial and angiogenic activity of the extracts. </p...|$|R

Based on ethno pharmacological and taxonomic information, antibacterial activities of methanol extracts of some medicinal plants of Iran were determined by In Vitro bioassays using agar diffusion-method against standard strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus and B. pumilis at 20 mg/ml. From 180 plant species of 72 families, 78 species (43. 3 %) in 42 families (58. 3 %) showed antibacterial activities against B. cereus (88. 4 %), B. subtilis (39. 7 %), B. pumilis (37. 1 %), P. fluorescens (37. 1 %) and P. aeruginos (10. 2 %). The most active plant families were Apiaceae, Compositae and Labiatae with 9, 8 and 7 active plant species respectively.

Objective: The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the protective role of seeds of <b>Terminalia</b> <b>chebula</b> in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice for Wound Healing Activity. Materials and Methods: The rate of wound contraction and estimation of various biochemical parameters such as superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels in the granulation tissue of diabetic and non-diabetic mice were considered. The extract of <b>Terminalia</b> <b>chebula</b> with the concentration of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg body weight was induced through intraperitoneal in diabetic and non-diabetic mice.
