5|$|On 4 June 2010, Drogba {{was injured}} in a {{friendly}} match with Japan. He received the injury in a high challenge from defender Túlio Tanaka. He fractured the ulna in his right arm and had an operation {{the next day in}} the hope of making the finals. On 15 June 2010, Drogba was cleared by FIFA to play in <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast's first group game against Portugal wearing a protective cast on his broken arm. The match ended in a goalless draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with Drogba coming on in the 65th minute. On 20 June 2010, Drogba became the first player from an African nation to score against Brazil in a World Cup match, scoring with a header in the 78th minute as <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast were defeated 1–3. On 25 June 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast went out of the competition despite winning 3–0 against North Korea in their final match.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ivories</b> mostly {{originated}} outside Mesopotamia and {{are thought}} to {{have been made in the}} Levant and Egypt. They are carved with motifs typical of those regions and were used to decorate high-status items of furniture or transportation. <b>The</b> <b>ivories</b> would have originally been decorated with gold leaf or semi-precious stones, which were stripped from them at some point before their final burial. Many were found at the bottom of wells, having apparently been dumped there during a period of war or unrest.|$|R

5|$|Borders and {{administration}} of the colony similarly changed a number of times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization of the colony split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast and Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|Climbié's parents {{created the}} Victoria Climbié Foundation UK, a charity {{that seeks to}} improve child {{protection}} policies, and the Victoria Climbié Charitable Trust, an organisation to build a school in <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast.

In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to be the end of the road for Drogba and <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Megiddo <b>ivories</b> {{are thin}} carvings in ivory found at Tel Megiddo, the {{majority}} excavated by Gordon Loud. <b>The</b> <b>ivories</b> {{are on display}} at the Oriental Institute of Chicago and the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. They were found in the stratum VIIA, or Late Bronze Age layer of the site. Carved from hippopotamus incisors from the Nile, they show Egyptian stylistic influence. An ivory pen case was found inscribed with the cartouche of Ramses III.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Nimrud <b>ivories</b> are carved ivory plaques {{and figures}} {{dating from the}} 9th to the 7th centuries BC that were {{excavated}} from the Assyrian city of Nimrud (in modern Ninawa in Iraq) during the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of <b>the</b> <b>ivories</b> {{were taken to the}} United Kingdom and were deposited in (though not owned by) the British Museum. In 2011, the Museum acquired most of <b>the</b> British-held <b>ivories</b> through a donation and purchase and is to put a selection on view. It is intended that the remainder will be returned to Iraq. A significant number of ivories were already held by Iraqi institutions but many have been lost or damaged through war and looting.|$|R
5|$|In the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations Drogba scored {{one goal}} in the 3–1 victory against Ghana in the group stage. <b>The</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast reached the quarter-finals but lost 2–3 to Algeria.

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying <b>the</b> <b>ivory</b> makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of <b>the</b> <b>ivory,</b> not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E
50|$|Vientiane, Laos, {{is a major}} {{venue for}} Chinese {{tourists}} looking to circumvent Chinese restrictions on <b>the</b> sale of <b>ivory.</b> <b>The</b> sale of <b>ivory</b> is done openly, including at San Jiang Market, in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, and in Luang Prabang Province.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{collection}} of <b>ivories</b> uncovered by Mallowan were divided between Iraq and Britain, where they {{remained at the}} British School of Archaeology in Iraq (later to become the British Institute for the Study of Iraq) until 1987. They were then put in storage at the British Museum until 2011, but were not put on display. Many of <b>the</b> Iraqi-held <b>ivories</b> have been lost or damaged. Following the Iraq War 2003 the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad was looted, and many of <b>the</b> <b>ivories</b> kept there were damaged or stolen. Other ivories that were stored in a bank vault in Baghdad were damaged by water when the building was shelled.|$|R

5|$|United States: In November 2013, the United States {{employed}} {{an industrial}} rock crusher to pulverize six tons of amassed ivory. Although the US does not ban the domestic sale of ivory, {{it is illegal}} to bring ivory into the country. Its interest in destroying its ivory was also connected to research that found links between <b>the</b> <b>ivory</b> trade and threats to national security through terrorism and organized crime. The US government and American non-governmental organizations have been involved in multiple forms of anti-poaching measures, largely in Africa, and American diplomats are actively engaging other governments to take part in eroding <b>the</b> <b>ivory</b> market by destroying stockpiles. Another ivory crush took place in New York City's Times Square in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Balotelli {{earned his}} first cap for Italy in a {{friendly}} match against <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast on 10 August 2010. He amassed over 30 caps and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2012, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup; he helped the national side reach the final of Euro 2012, and also won a bronze medal at the Confederations Cup. Along with Antonio Cassano, he is Italy's top-scorer in the UEFA European Championships, with 3 goals. He is also Italy's top scorer in the FIFA Confederations Cup, alongside Giuseppe Rossi and Daniele De Rossi, with two goals.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006, Drogba captained <b>the</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast {{to their}} second Africa Cup of Nations final, scoring the only {{goal in their}} semi-final match with Nigeria and putting away the {{deciding}} spot-kick in their record-tying 12–11 penalty shootout quarter-final win over Cameroon. However, they lost in the final to Egypt 4–2 on penalty kicks after a 0–0 draw, with Drogba's shot being stopped by Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary.|$|E
50|$|The finds were divided, in {{accordance}} with the system of partage, between the Musée Guimet and the National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul. After the Kabul Museum closed in 1978 the whereabouts of <b>the</b> <b>ivories</b> was uncertain, and many items were looted in the 1990s.|$|R
