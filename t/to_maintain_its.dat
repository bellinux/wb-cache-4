5|$|With the {{departure}} of Portuguese professionals and tradesmen, the new country had no senior workforce <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> infrastructure, and economic collapse loomed.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Army had to handle huge {{stockpiles}} of equipment, stores and supplies. Some were far {{in excess of}} the Army's needs and had to be disposed of. Hospitals still had to be run, although some were transferred to the Department of Repatriation. The Army had <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> schools and training establishments. Moreover, the Army had to field and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E

Harvard won the first game, in which its rules were used, 3–0. The second game, which was played under rugby regulations, did not have a winner as neither team managed to score.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam.

The restoration was funded by an anonymous donor and involved Art Work Fine Art Services, Industrial Craters & Packers, O'Neill Transfer Co., Smith Masonry Contractors and the Regional Arts & Culture Council. This marked {{the sculpture}}'s first restoration since 1985. Allow Me receives cold wax coatings each year <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> shine.|$|E

While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water.

5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>its</b> shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The Council of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a {{politically}} independent think tank dedicated to {{defence and security}} issues, elected Dannatt as the Institute's Chairman in June 2009.
