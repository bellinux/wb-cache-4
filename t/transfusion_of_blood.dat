In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed {{the first successful}} transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of blood from his arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the <b>transfusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> He made {{a substantial amount of}} money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).|$|E

2500|$|The Rh system (Rh meaning Rhesus) is {{the second}} most {{significant}} blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances. [...] However, D-negative individuals can produce IgG anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal <b>transfusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive RBCs.

The memory of his work on the <b>transfusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> recurred to me. These creatures I had seen were the victims of some hideous experiment. These sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back, to fool me with their display of confidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible than death,--with torture; and after torture the most hideous degradation it is possible to conceive,--to send me off a lost soul, a beast, to the rest of their Comus rout.|$|E
60|$|Was {{this the}} same Moreau? He had {{published}} some very astonishing facts {{in connection with}} the <b>transfusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house. It was in the silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It {{was not the first time}} that conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider.|$|E
