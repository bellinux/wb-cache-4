25|$|After the war it was {{eventually}} {{decided to build}} a suspended cable car line from a point close to the intended start point of the previously planned rack railway. The line was privately built and owned, opening on 17 July 1930 {{after three years of}} construction.

50|$|Materials include steel (in {{the form}} of links or cables), polyurethane, rubber, and fabric. The original-style steel-link chains are also {{available}} {{in a variety of}} carbon steel and steel alloys and link shapes. Link shapes include standard, twisted, square, and reinforced. The shape of the links changes the flexibility, grip, and strength of the chain. The links can also have added studs or V-bars for an even more aggressive traction. The use of alloy steel and hardened steel adds durability. <b>Traction</b> <b>cables</b> (cable chains, snow cables) attach like chains but are made from cable rather than chain.|$|R

5000|$|The Chemin de fer du Salève [...] (nicknamed Funiculaire du Salève {{in spite}} of the absence of any <b>traction</b> <b>cable),</b> was an {{electric}} rack railway that went up the Salève mountain in the French département of Haute-Savoie {{on the south side of}} Geneva. In the 1890s, as today, the inhabitants of Geneva enjoyed the view afforded from the Salève of the Jura, the Alps (including the Mont-Blanc) and part of lac Léman, However it was a 3-hour walk up to les Treize Arbres. This was the heyday of local railways in France, and Chemin de fer du Salève came into being in 1892. It continued operations until 1935.|$|E
50|$|Trains can {{run in a}} {{pinched loop}} configuration, with trains {{reversing}} direction at each end onto the opposite track. Alternately a shuttle service can be operated, with a single train shuttling backwards and forwards on one track, or a double-shuttle service with one train on each track. In order to allow this flexibility, the <b>traction</b> <b>cables</b> are arranged into five loops: one {{in each of the}} main tunnels driven by 465 kW motors, one in each of the reversing lines driven by 266 kW motors, and one in the maintenance siding driven by a 55 kW motor.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFurther {{development}} of advanced therapeutic endoscopic techniques and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) requires a powerful flexible endoscopic multitasking platform. MethodsMedline search {{was performed to}} identify literature relating to flexible endoscopic multitasking platform from year 2004 – 2011 using keywords: Flexible endoscopic multitasking platform, NOTES, Instrumentation, Endoscopic robotic surgery, and specific names of various endoscopic multitasking platforms. Key articles from articles references were reviewed. ResultsFlexible multitasking platforms can be classified as either mechanical or robotic. Purely mechanical systems include the dual channel endoscope (DCE) (Olympus), R-Scope (Olympus), the EndoSamurai (Olympus), the ANUBIScope (Karl-Storz), Incisionless Operating Platform (IOP) (USGI), and DDES system (Boston Scientific). Robotic systems include the MASTER system (Nanyang University, Singapore) and the Viacath (Hansen Medical). The DCE, the R-Scope, the EndoSamurai and the ANUBIScope have integrated visual function and instrument manipulation function. The IOP and DDES systems rely on the conventional flexible endoscope for visualization, and instrument manipulation is integrated {{through the use of}} a flexible, often lockable, multichannel access device. The advantage of the access device concept is that it allows optics and instrument dissociation. Due to the anatomical constrains of the pharynx, systems are designed to have a diameter of less than 20  mm. All systems are controlled by <b>traction</b> <b>cable</b> system actuated either by hand or by robotic machinery. In a flexible system, this method of actuation inevitably leads to significant hysteresis. This problem will be accentuated with a long endoscope such as that required in performing colonic procedures. Systems often require multiple operators. To date, the DCE, the R-Scope, the IOP, and the Viacath system have data published relating to their application in human. ConclusionAlternative forms of instrument actuation, camera control and master console ergonomics should be explored to improve instrument precision, sphere of action, size and minimize assistance required...|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} of long bone defects {{in the lower}} extremity is a challenging reconstructive problem for orthopedic surgeons. For many years, bone grafting {{was the most common}} treatment to bridge segmental bone defects. Since the discovery of distraction osteogenesis, first introduced by Ilizarov, this method has become a successful alternative to bone grafting [5]. This method can be associated with several complications [9, 28]. Problems such as pin-track infection, pain, joint instability and stiffness are related mostly to the external fixator [7, 8, 29]. In an effort to reduce these complications, numerous new devices and implants have been developed [11, 12, 30]. Paley et al compared a standard Ilizarov method to a combination of external fixation with interlocking intramedullary nailing in a study on femoral lengthening. They concluded that lengthening over an intramedullary nail decreases the duration of external fixation, protects against refracture and allows earlier rehabilitation [31]. These results were supported by Kocaoglu et al. [32] in their report of external fixator-assisted bone segment transport over an intramedullary nail for reconstruction of bone defects of the lower extremity. Although several studies showed advantages in combining external with internal fixation, there is, still, the risk of pin-track infection leading to deep intramedullary infection [9, 33, 34]. With fully implantable intramedullary CDS, the potential is to overcome the problem of pin-track infection and to improve comfort during treatment [14, 28]. One of these intramedullary devices is the Albizzia nail comprising two telescopic cylinders in which lengthening is achieved by rotating movements of the limb [11]. Although clinical results were promising, patients complained about pain which made ratcheting difficult [16]. The Intramedullary Skeletal Kinetic Distractor (ISKD) is another mechanically driven device which lengthens through torsional movement of the limb [13]. Several authors published their experience with lengthening using the ISKD and described complications such as runaway nails, premature consolidation, severe pain and uncontrolled lengthening [17, 18, 19, 20, 28]. The ISKD has, so far, been described for the use in limb lengthening but not for the {{treatment of}} bone defects. Hyodo et al. [30] have recently reported a <b>traction</b> <b>cable</b> device for bone segment transport in the canine femur using an interlocking intramedullary rod for fixation. However, this device comprises an external distraction apparatus, and local infection at the exit side of the cable and along the cable tract has been reported. To our knowledge, only three fully implantable CDS have been described for the treatment of bone defects in humans. The recent Phoenix nail is a magnetically activated drive system, and the first results for the use in bone defect treatment are promising [14]. Another recent development is the magnet-operated telescopic PRECICE nail [35]. It has both CE mark and US FDA clearance for its first- and second-generation implants, and good results for the treatment of limb length discrepancies have been reported [35]. Although the reliability of this novel system seems to be comparable to other intramedullary nails, a magnet-driven device is a novel technology and literature regarding its efficacy, reliability, complication rate and safety is sparse [36]. Baumgart et al. [15] reported a patient with a 12 -cm bone defect after tumor resection who was treated successfully using an intramedullary motorized nail (Fitbone). Betz et al. [12] reported also of good clinical outcomes using the Fitbone nail in leg lengthening. These results were further supported by Singh et al. [37] and Krieg et al. [38] who published their experience with the Fitbone nail with a relatively low complication rate of 12.5  % in leg lengthening. Although these devices seem to be appropriate for the treatment of bone defects, few publications exist on their use in bone defect treatment [15]. Moreover, the Fitbone nail comprises a complex motorized mechanism that is expensive and increases the risk of technical failure which further limits its use. For that reason, our aim was to design a simple and non-motorized intramedullary CDS as a reasonable alternative to the currently existing treatment options.|$|E

30|$|To avoid {{stray current}} and {{maintain}} the benefit of no phase-split in the DC traction power supply system, an AC traction power supply system was proposed for the urban public transport such as metro and light rail transit. The proposed system consists of a main substation (MSS) and <b>cable</b> <b>traction</b> network (CTN). The MSS includes a single-phase main traction transformer and a negative-sequence compensation device, while the CTN includes double-core <b>cables,</b> <b>traction</b> transformers, overhead catenary system, rails, etc. Several key techniques for the proposed system were put forward and discussed, which can be summarized as (1) the power supply principle, equivalent circuit and transmission ability of the CTN, the cable-catenary matching technique, and the selection of catenary voltage level; (2) the segmentation technology and status identification method for traction power supply network, distributed and centralized protection schemes, etc.; (3) a power supply scheme for single-line MSS and a power supply scheme of MSS shared by two or more lines. The proposed industrial frequency single-phase AC traction power supply system shows an excellent technical performance, good economy, and high reliability, hence provides a new alternative for metro and urban rail transit power supply systems.|$|R
