5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E

There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war {{was linked to the}} {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who had the support of the Wallachian rulers and was married to Anna of the House of Basarab.|$|E

Even though the Blake Lively/Rihanna episode {{established}} that he died in 2009 at the age of 28 (Ass Dan was born in 1981), he was brought back as one half of the Thrilla Killa Klownz on the episode hosted by Ryan Phillippe in the music video [...] "Magical Mysteries" [...] (in which it was stated <b>that</b> Ass <b>Dan</b> [...] "did just die" [...] in the 2010 sketch, making Ass Dan 29 at the time), brought back again for the 2010 Crunkmas Carnival sketch (in which Li'l Blaster established <b>that</b> Ass <b>Dan</b> was dead and finally getting the wake he deserves), and brought back again for the 2011 Easter Festival (in which D.J. Supersoak established <b>that</b> Ass <b>Dan</b> was getting a proper burial), making Ass Dan 30 {{years old at the time}} of this death. The 2011 Columbus Day Assblast on the episode hosted by Ben Stiller implied <b>that</b> Ass <b>Dan</b> was still alive, though he almost suffered a heart attack and still died before he could say that he was going to live forever after the heart attack allegedly passed.

Dan confidently tells Ambrose he is making a new start, and already has a date lined up from the dating agency.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, Savage split {{company with}} McHenry, {{who had been}} Dan Patch's trainer and driver since 1901. A variety of reasons were cited, {{including}} McHenry's drinking and his complaints that Savage was treating Dan Patch like a circus act. Savage replaced McHenry with Harry Hersey, {{who had been the}} manager of Savage's farm in Minnesota but had little race-driving experience. Savage had no inclination to test Dan Patch in competitive formats, where even the fastest horse can lose due to a variety of factors. Instead, Savage used Dan Patch to promote the horse feed supplements his company produced and, in the model of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, turned each appearance by Dan Patch into a major event. Dan Patch was shipped in a custom built rail-car, with half of the space reserved for Dan Patch and the other half for his grooms and the horses used as prompters. Savage estimated <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> Patch traveled roughly 10,000 miles in 1904 alone.|$|E

For {{the next two}} months, she rested, while working with writers from her film L.A. Bounty, but the pain worsened. Doctors misdiagnosed her condition as either a strained muscle or a damaged nerve, and they prescribed painkillers and massages. Finally, a surgeon, recommended by Jack Nicholson, discovered <b>that</b> <b>Danning</b> had two severely herniated discs, and was put into the hospital that same afternoon.|$|R
25|$|A {{domestic}} abuse case tests Malick's temper. Suspecting an injured husband of beating his wife, Malick switches his pain-relieving morphine for saline {{to increase his}} suffering. When Penny is killed in a train crash, her brother Oliver (James Anderson) confides in Malick {{that he is not}} a qualified doctor, as he switched his own exam paper with Penny's while they were at university. Malick dissuades Oliver from confessing to Hanssen, and agrees to keep his secret. Hanssen transfers Malick from the AAU to Keller, the hospital's general surgery ward. There, he attempts to ingratiate himself with consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), but discord arises between the two when Ric insinuates that Malick performed a hysterectomy on a drug-addicted mother out of spite rather than medical necessity. Malick also comes into conflict with orthopaedic surgeon Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill) over treatment of a patient, which intensifies when he discovers <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> has been illegally providing an old friend with steroids. A physical altercation ensues, which results in Dan kissing Malick, before running off to be with his girlfriend, ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley).|$|E
25|$|Dan Patch next {{tackled the}} record for one mile on a half-mile track. Because the horse must {{negotiate}} more and tighter turns on a smaller track, the half-mile track record is slower than the time on a one-mile track. Even today, separate records are kept in harness racing depending on the track dimensions. On September 7 at the half-mile track in Lima, Ohio, Dan Patch paced a world record of 2:04, {{only to have the}} record broken by Prince Alert a few weeks later. Prince Alert then lowered the world record on a one-mile track to an astonishing 1:57, thanks in part to perfect weather conditions but also aided by a large canvas sail carried between the galloping horses who set the pace. Critics pointed out that the sail, later referred to as a wind shield, lessened the wind resistance that a horse faced (similar to drafting in cycling or motor racing). Although the usage of wind shields was eventually disallowed by the American Trotting Register, in the short term it meant <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> Patch was no longer the fastest horse in the world.|$|E
25|$|Franchitti, again {{driving for}} Target Chip Ganassi Racing, won the season opening road race at St. Petersburg, Florida. He {{followed}} that win with additional wins at Texas Motor Speedway (28th victory). He took the pole and the {{win in the}} Milwaukee 225 for his 29th victory, tying him with Rick Mears for 9th all-time in American Open Wheel racing. In the final race of the season at Las Vegas, Franchitti had an 18-point lead over Will Power in the points standings. However, a 15-car crash on lap 11 caused the race to be red flagged. After a two-hour delay, IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard announced <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> Wheldon had died from the crash and the race was formally abandoned. The drivers who were not involved did a five-lap tribute to Wheldon 10 minutes after the announcement. Because the race was canceled and Power was also involved in the crash, Franchitti won his third consecutive and fourth overall IndyCar championship. Since Power suffered severe damage, Franchitti would have won the championship if the race had continued; therefore, the early stoppage of the race {{had no effect on}} the championship points.|$|E

25|$|In 1884 Van and Ada, age 14 and 12, fall passionately in love, {{and their}} affair {{is marked by}} a {{powerful}} sense of romantic eroticism. The book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister. The passage is notoriously difficult, more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn (treating it as obvious), and it is only referred to in passing later in the text. Although Ada's mother keeps a wedding photo dated August 1871, eleven months before her birth, they find in a box in the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to December 1871; and furthermore <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> had been abroad since that spring, as proved by his extensive filmreels. Hence he is not Ada's father. Furthermore, they find an annotated flower album kept by Marina in 1869–70 which indicates, very obliquely, that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium {{at the same time as}} Aqua; that 99 orchids were delivered to Marina, from Demon, on Van's birthday; and that Aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident. It later transpires that Marina gave the child to her sister to replace the one she had lost—so she is in fact Van's mother—and that her affair with Demon continued until Ada's conception. This makes Lucette (Dan and Marina's child) the uterine half-sister of both of them.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, {{to see if they could}} find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig at the site of the hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.|$|E
25|$|The first season's {{main focus}} is Serena van der Woodsen's sudden {{return to the}} Upper East Side {{following}} her mysterious disappearance. Everyone is extremely shocked at her sudden return after first sightings of her spread across the web, when she is spotted at Grand Central station including her best friend, Blair Waldorf. It turns out Serena returns from Boarding School to see her suicidal brother, Eric. Blair soon finds out that Serena had slept with her boyfriend, Nate Archibald, the night of her disappearance. Meanwhile, Brooklyn boy Dan Humphrey and Serena begin dating while Nate struggles with his feelings for Blair. The two try to salvage what's left of their relationship, only leaving Blair to lose her virginity to Nate's best friend, Chuck Bass, instead. Jenny Humphrey constantly tries {{to make it in}} this upscale world by following around Blair and her friends. Rufus Humphrey, her father, worries that Jenny may be losing herself as she strives for popularity. Vanessa Abrams, Dan's best friend, returns. We find out <b>that</b> <b>Dan</b> had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends, considering Dan is now with Serena. It is discovered that Lilly van der Woodsen and Rufus Humphrey have a romantic past, yet both struggle with other relationships. The two decide to see other people in light of their children's romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex, despite her affair with Chuck. Nate finds out about the affair and he and Chuck stop associating with one another. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, comes back and causes havoc, including outing Eric van der Woodsen. Georgina's return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, since Serena tries to hide her secret from him and Georgina (pretending to be Sarah) manipulates Dan. It is revealed that the true reason Serena left the Upper East Side was because she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. However, the incident is finally resolved and Georgina leaves. However, Dan and Serena's relationship is in ruins and the two decide to break it off. Meanwhile, Lilly accepts her proposal from Bart Bass, despite her ever-present feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.|$|E
