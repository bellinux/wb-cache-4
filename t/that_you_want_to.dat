And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic.

The nurses, who both live in Jal, New Mexico, were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH. After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, [...] "He’s {{done a lot of}} good in this county.

500|$|The {{entertainment}} news site Mandatory said Partridge was [...] "a fascinatingly layered and fully realised creation {{of years of}} storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick — he feels like a living, breathing person, but a living, breathing person <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> strangle." [...] The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing [...] "awkward" [...] sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners, Nighty Night and Peep Show, and wrote: [...] "Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers." [...] In 2014, Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as [...] "one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations {{of the last few}} decades." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars {{and noted that}} despite the episode being [...] "Funny stuff," [...] it was {{ultimately}} [...] "a little uneven overall." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Despite calling the episode [...] "a likeable piece of work", the two explained that the story itself was fine, but that the episode's set piece did not work with the plot. Shearman and Pearson, however, ultimately concluded that the premise was [...] "such a well-meaning little bauble <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> applaud it for its intent if nothing else." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Homer and his {{children}} {{want to see the}} unveiling of a new Funtendo console called Zii Zu, which is a reference to Nintendo's Wii U console. As he and the children make their way through the crowded convention to get to the unveiling, the screen turns into a first-person shooter game through the eyes of Homer. He uses Frisbees and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward. According to Selman, the inspiration for this came from the fact that [...] "if you've been to E3, you know it's insane, it's super-crowded, it's super-loud, and walking through it feels like a video game, like a nightmarish first-person video game of bloggers and nerds. You just want to get the thing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get to." ...|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} John Lasseter {{explained that}} [...] "The challenge is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make Rapunzel {{feel like a}} smart, clever, educated, healthy, fun human being" [...] {{despite the fact that}} the character has not ventured outside of her tower in 18 years. To avoid creating a [...] "princessy and aloof" [...] heroine, the animators decided to base Rapunzel's personality on actresses Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, and Amy Poehler, which ultimately resulted in the character having a variety of [...] "quirky qualities" [...] that were used to [...] "shake up expectations of what a princess should be." [...] According to The New York Times, Rapunzel's personality made her a significant departure from traditional Disney heroines. Mandy Moore believes that Rapunzel is an atypical Disney princess because she is an independent character who [...] "can take care of herself", in addition to being largely oblivious to the fact that she is a princess.|$|E
500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take her home {{and give her a}} shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E

500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated [...] "The thing about writer's block is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write so f---king bad, [...] the songs don't come out that way. They come from life. So you've got to live to write." [...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), {{as well as the}} Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven Must Be Like This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, [...] "Nothing Even Matters", with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking weed, and making music.|$|E
500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bang on; rent {{what you want to}} rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where your mind and your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got to be something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do with all your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... By the time you get the sounds <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E

Additionally, Einck was positive towards Stan's, Inna's and Yankee's vocal parts, but felt they didn't match together. Direct Lyrics's Kevin Apaza labelled the recording as a [...] "future-European-summer-smash", and saw its drop as [...] "going to cause some fierce-dancing moments at clubs". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse felt [...] "We Wanna" [...] was a [...] "super solid, club-ready summer jam bound to blow up from Argentina to Morocco, full of catchy hooks ('Bout to go!') and infectiously sax-y sax noises borrowed from the home of Mr. Saxobeat." [...] He eventually found Stan and Inna outperformed Rihanna and Shakira, and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, who previously formed female duos. Mike Wass, writing for Idolator, expressed that the track was [...] "a guilty pleasure of the highest order". German portal Hitfire was generally positive towards [...] "We Wanna", explaining that its [...] "verses are disappointingly quiet until the chorus turns up something. Nevertheless, [...] is after a few plays a catchy tune <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear again and again." [...] Music website Pop Shock's Dijei Zasin criticized Yankee's vocal collaboration on the single for [...] "unnecessary [...] down the song", suggesting that American rapper Pitbull would be an option to feature on a version of [...] "We Wanna" [...] destined to the United Kingdom and the United States. He further concluded that, [...] "What works here are the verses laced in the singers’ trademark attitude, contrasting with the vibey, chilled chorus." ...|$|E
