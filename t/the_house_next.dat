Synge's mother moved the family to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door to her mother's house in Rathgar, County Dublin. Synge, although often ill, had a happy childhood there. He developed an interest in bird-watching {{along the banks of the}} River Dodder and during family holidays at the seaside resort of Greystones, County Wicklow, and the family estate at Glanmore.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Chatterton, {{whose father}} was sexton of St Mary Redcliffe, was born in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> to the church in 1752. He studied the church records in a room above the south porch, and wrote several works which he {{attempted}} to pass as genuine medieval documents. He committed suicide in London {{at the age of}} seventeen. In 1795 the church saw the marriages of Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Sara Fricker and Robert Southey to Sarah's sister Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27–28 February 1917, Michael {{attempted}} to return to Gatchina from Petrograd, {{where he had been}} in conference with Rodzianko and from where he had telegraphed the Tsar, but revolutionary patrols and sporadic fire prevented his progress. Revolutionaries patrolled the streets, rounding up people connected with the old regime. Michael managed to reach the Winter Palace, where he ordered the guards to withdraw to the Admiralty, because it afforded greater safety and a better tactical position, and because it was a less politically charged location. Michael himself took refuge in the apartment of an acquaintance, Princess Putyatina, on Millionnaya street. In the neighbouring apartments, the Tsar's Chamberlain Nikolai Stolypin and the Procurator of the Holy Synod were detained by revolutionaries and in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door General Baron Staekelberg was killed when his house was stormed by a mob.|$|E

25|$|Soane {{demolished}} {{and rebuilt}} three houses in succession {{on the north}} side of Lincoln's Inn Fields. He began with No. 12 (between 1792 and 1794), externally a plain brick house. After becoming Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy in 1806, Soane purchased No. 13, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door, today the museum, and rebuilt it in two phases in 1808–09 and 1812.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was renovated in 1879 {{and again in}} 1887 when <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door, along with The Hampshire Hog in The Strand and the Nell Gwynne Tavern in Bull Inn Court, were bought by the Gattis in order to enlarge the theatre. They also built a new enlarged facade and part of this can still be seen today above the Crystal Rooms {{next door to the}} present Adelphi Theatre.|$|E

25|$|Among {{his other}} rewards for loyalty, Censorinus {{was allowed to}} buy Cicero's house on the Palatine, which the orator had exerted such strenuous efforts to restore after its {{confiscation}} in connection to his exile. Its value was reckoned at 3,500,000 sesterces. Although the Palatine house, along with Cicero's other confiscated property following his death, was sold ostensibly at public auction, the symbolism of its possession can hardly have been left to chance. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> passed to T. Statilius Taurus, whom Cicero notoriously associated with Calvisius.|$|E
25|$|This {{decision}} to allow previous evictees to become eligible to win the show was criticised. Channel 4 received 500 complaints from viewers about this matter and Media watchdog Ofcom confirmed that it had received over 1,000 complaints, and referred viewers to ICSTIS. Soon after the four ex-housemates entered <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Next</b> Door, ICSTIS released a statement confirming that it was dealing with over 2,500 complaints and launched an official investigation. On 5 October 2006, they ruled that Channel 4 had breached its code and imposed £50,000 'administrative charges'.|$|E

Their presence was {{revealed to the}} other housemates and Imogen and Richard, who were up for eviction that week, joined them. Nikki was chosen by the remaining housemates {{to return to the}} Big Brother House and become eligible to win the £100,000 prize money and Grace, Mikey and Lea left <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Next</b> Door.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Carrisford and his Indian {{assistant}} Ram Dass {{have moved}} into <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door to Miss Minchin's school. Carrisford had been Captain Crewe's friend and partner in the diamond mines. After the diamond mine venture failed, both Crewe and Carrisford became very ill, and Carrisford in his delirium abandoned his friend Crewe, who died of his 'jungle fever.' As it turned out, the diamond mines did not fail, but instead were a great success, making Carrisford extremely rich. Although Carrisford survived, he suffers from several ailments and is guilt-ridden over abandoning his friend. He is determined to find Crewe's daughter and heir, although {{he does not know}} where she is and thinks she is attending school in France or Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} the corner of the room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, the {{congregation}} bought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door, {{on the north}} side of the building. Renovations were completed a year later, in 1991. Known as the Annex Building, it is used for daily prayers and Torah study. The building also contains office space. In 1996, extensive renovations were done to Social Hall area of the building. The hall was demolished, and a new more modern banquet hall was built in its place. Additionally, a new synagogue building known as B'nei Shaare Zion capable of seating upwards of 250 worshipers, a Beth midrash with dual use as a prayer space on an upper level, and a secondary synagogue along with several meeting rooms on a lower level were built as well. During the 2000s, restoration work was carried out on the dome of the main sanctuary after forty years of continuous exposure to the elements.|$|E
25|$|Wellesley {{was born}} into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family in Ireland as The Hon. Arthur Wesley, the third of five {{surviving}} sons (fourth otherwise) to Anne and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His mother was the eldest daughter of The 1st Viscount Dungannon. As such, he belonged to the Protestant Ascendancy. His biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence in {{saying that he was}} born on 1 May 1769, the day before he was baptised. His birthplace is uncertain. He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, now the Merrion Hotel. But his mother Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin. Other places have been put forward as the location of his birth, including Mornington House (<b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>next</b> door on Upper Merrion), as his father had asserted; the Dublin packet boat; and the mansion in the family estate of Athy (consumed in the fires of 1916), as the Duke apparently put on his 1851 census return.|$|E
