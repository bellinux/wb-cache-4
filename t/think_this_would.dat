25|$|While {{some public}} health officials, pediatricians, {{and social workers}} wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, others did not <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> solve the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, director of the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Spears' manager Larry Rudolph told The Sun that a {{video for}} [...] "Radar" [...] {{directed}} by Spears {{was to be}} shot in Chelsea, London. The concept would have Spears and her friends chasing a man in different clubs. However, this was scrapped along with the single’s release. The music video for [...] "Radar" [...] from Circus was filmed on May 27 and 28, 2009, at the Bacara Resort & Spa located in Santa Barbara, California. It was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked with Spears on her music videos for [...] "Lucky", [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Outrageous" [...] {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. Meyers claimed the video pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's 1994 single [...] "Take a Bow". He added, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's video. Britney hasn't done anything like that". He had a very clear idea of how he wanted the story line to work: [...] "There is a narrative going on, a romantic triangle on a weekend at this polo mansion," [...] he said. [...] "A soap-opera romance." [...] Meyers commented that working with Spears again was [...] "a great celebration of trusting one another", explaining that both wanted [...] "to do something fresh and new, seeking out an actual different technique and stylistic choices and trying to find a form to celebrate them in." [...] Since the song was not the first single from Circus, Meyers chose to experiment and not have dancing scenes, saying that [...] "the videos are a chance for her to vocalize a sense of herself. The media tends to attack her, so I thought, 'Let's show the classy side of Britney and focus on a classy experience, very European-inspired'. And she's at the point in her career where I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be a nice step." [...] After the video was finished, Meyers said he was happy with the lack of dancing scenes, because the cuts and dissolves kept the pace of the song.|$|E

2500|$|With [...] "The Truth About Heaven", {{the group}} were {{initially}} unsure {{of how to}} go into the first verse. According to Decicco, Jorgensen came up with a part [...] "and he was like, 'I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be really cool over the verses." [...] I played it and I was like, [...] "That actually is really cool." [...] Decicco called it a riff [...] "that I never expected to hear over it". Decicco said the group wanted [...] "Remember to Feel Real" [...] to [...] "just have it start and ... kick your ass". The pre-chorus riff was written by Jorgensen and Decicco while on tour. The bridge in [...] "Stay on the Ground" [...] features a flange effect, which was written by Decicco and played through a Line 6 Pedal. Jorgensen came up with a keyboard part, which he wrote a song around that became [...] "A Quick Little Flight".|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it would be the worst thing he could do. However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners". They felt he was bound to mess up his relationship with Tanya, but thought it would more likely be something else that would do that. Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be it. Soaplife later ruled out Max, asking [...] "why would he go for hamburger (Kat) when he has steak (Tanya) at home?" [...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel. So it would make a lot of sense for it to be him. It would be bad timing, though, because he's planning to get remarried!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Antonescu {{traveled}} to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944. Such close contacts helped cement an enduring {{relationship between the}} two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only trustworthy person in Romania, and the only foreigner to consult on military matters. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that Hitler after first meeting Antonescu [...] "...was greatly impressed by him; no other leader Hitler met other than Mussolini ever received such consistently favorable comments from the German dictator. Hitler even mustered the patience to listen to Antonescu's lengthy disquisitions on the glorious history of Romania and the perfidy of the Hungarians-a curious reversal for a man who was more accustomed to regaling visitors with tirades of his own". In later statements, Hitler offered praise to Antonescu's [...] "breadth of vision" [...] and [...] "real personality." [...] A remarkable aspect of the Hitler-Antonescu friendship was neither could speak others' language. Hitler only knew German while the only foreign language Antonescu knew was French (in which he was completely fluent). During their meetings, Antonescu spoke in French which was then translated into German by Hitler's translator Paul Schmidt and vice versa (Schmidt did not speak Romanian). The German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece (see Balkans Campaign). In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom (at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany) aggravated into conflict: on February 10, 1941, British Premier Winston Churchill recalled His Majesty's Ambassador Reginald Hoare, and approved the blockade of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports. On 12 June 1941 during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the [...] "special" [...] nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to [...] "annihilate" [...] the forces of [...] "Judo-Bolshevism", a [...] "war of extermination" [...] to be fought without any mercy and Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the [...] "Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia" [...] he had issued to his forces about the [...] "special treatment" [...] to be handed out to Soviet Jews. Antonescu completely accepted Hitler's ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a [...] "race war" [...] between the Aryans represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs. the Slavs and Asians commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side. Besides for anti-Semitism, there was an extremely strong current of anti-Slavic and anti-Asian racism to Antonescu's remarks about the [...] "Asiatic hordes" [...] of the Red Army. The Asians Antonescu referred were the various Asian peoples of the Soviet Union such as the Kazakhs, Kalmyks, Mongols, Uzbeks, Buriats, etc. During his summit with Hitler in June 1941, Antonescu told the Führer that he believed it was necessary to [...] "once and for all" [...] eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians was the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews. Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: [...] "Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany." [...] Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt. In Antonescu's mind, the Romanians as a Latin people had attained a level of civilization that the Slavs were nowhere as close to, but theoretically the Slavic Russians and Ukrainians might be able to reach under Romanian auspices, through Antonescu's remarks to Hitler that [...] "We must fight this race resolutely" [...] (i.e. the Slavs) together with the need for [...] "colonization" [...] of Transnistria suggested that he did <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> happen in his own lifetime. Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as untermensch ("sub-humans"). Hitler's promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless.|$|E
