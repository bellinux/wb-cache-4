5|$|In 2001 Gascoigne's then-chairman Bill Kenwright {{contacted}} Gascoigne's therapist at the Priory, John McKeown, who organised more {{treatment to}} help Gascoigne <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> drinking. As {{part of the}} treatment {{he was sent to}} the United States where he had a stay at a clinic in Cottonwood, Arizona. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He stayed at the clinic in 2003 after he suffered low points working in China, and again in 2004 after retiring from football.|$|E

Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth who is able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to}} see themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance {{with the}} earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to {{take the form of}} Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E
5|$|The Holborn rail crash {{occurred}} on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train stop system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident {{was caused by the}} driver failing <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} an {{immediate}} success when published– by Beilby and Bewick themselves– in 1797. Just prior to its publication, Bewick published an anthology in 1795 {{on the study of}} character in the Kings and Queens of England. Given the success of the 1797 publication of his bird illustrations, Bewick started work at once on the second volume, Water Birds, but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby. Bewick was unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> feelings and resolve issues quietly, so the partnership ended, turbulently and expensively, leaving Bewick with his own workshop. Bewick had to pay £20, equivalent to about £20,400 in 2011, in lawyer's fees, and more than £21 for Beilby's share of the workshop equipment.|$|E
5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to contrive further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

5|$|Although William's main rivals were gone, {{he still}} faced rebellions over the {{following}} years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. <b>To</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, {{the introduction of the}} Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, {{which may or may not}} have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|In Reverse/Rebirth, Riku {{has been}} transported from {{the realm of}} {{darkness}} and fights his inner darkness as he battles upward from the basement levels of Castle Oblivion. Vexen fights Riku to obtain his data and creates the replica of him to counter Marluxia's plan. Ansem, still possessing Riku's body, tries to regain control of Riku, but Mickey's power keeps Ansem at bay. On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, a member of Vexen's circle, only to be dragged into the realm of darkness. However, he is saved by King Mickey when Ansem nearly succeeds in taking Riku's body as his own. With Marluxia eliminated by this time, another of Vexen's allies, Zexion, attempts to dispose of Riku by drowning him in light. Riku is saved by Naminé disguised as Kairi, who helps him <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> darkness, allowing him to defeat Zexion. Riku later meets DiZ, an enigmatic individual interested in Riku who sends him to find Naminé. Riku's replica, who has since learned of his altered memories and seeks to justify his existence, fights Riku only to be destroyed by him. Riku chooses to face Ansem upon learning from Naminé that Ansem lives in his heart, and defeats him after DiZ summons him for Riku to fight. Riku then sets out on a journey to utilize both his darkness and his light with King Mickey as his companion.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>his</b> seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E
