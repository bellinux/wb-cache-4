5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser <b>then</b> <b>glanced</b> a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E
500|$|Earp {{was embarrassed}} on January 9, 1876, {{when he was}} sitting with friends {{in the back room}} of the Custom House Saloon when his loaded single-action {{revolver}} fell out of his holster. It discharged when the hammer hit the floor. [...] "The ball passed through his coat, struck the north wall <b>then</b> <b>glanced</b> off and passed out through the ceiling." [...] Wyatt was so red-faced by the incident that years later, he persuaded biographer Stuart Lake to omit it from his book Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal.|$|E

San Francisco downed a Nakajima B5N [...] "Kate" [...] torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a kamikaze attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed [...] off the starboard bow. After the raid, San Francisco shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions {{on the east}} coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon.
