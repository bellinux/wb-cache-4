5|$|A small walled {{cemetery}} {{was constructed}} {{halfway between the}} lighthouse and the summit of Sotan for <b>the</b> <b>keepers.</b> This contains the grave of a visiting inspector and those {{of a number of}} the keepers' children. A Blenheim bomber crashed into the cliffs nearby during World War II, but the wreck was not discovered until many years later by a rock climber.|$|E
50|$|Angel {{demands that}} the priest give him Jasmine’s true name, but the priest reveals that he can’t; only <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> of <b>the</b> name has it. The priest is the {{guardian}} of the word, but the guardian of the word is not <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of <b>the</b> name. The word is the name, so the priest is the guardian of <b>the</b> <b>Keeper</b> - <b>the</b> <b>keeper</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Keeper.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Keeper</b> {{happens to be in}} the corner of the room, but the priest warns that he’ll only speak Jasmine’s real name with his last breath.

5|$|While {{there are}} other humans besides the {{children}} on the Rings, {{the majority of the}} inhabitants are of alien species. <b>The</b> <b>Keepers</b> are an intelligent species of two-headed beings who act as the overseers. Other species encountered include Belarans, Choi, Solinns, and Trefaldoors, all of which become interesting roles for young players to choose from in the game, Rings of Orbis.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. <b>The</b> <b>keepers</b> had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E

In Power Play, when Maleficent and Chernabog are captured by <b>the</b> <b>Keepers,</b> the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{principal}} keeper was James Ewing {{who looked}} after the light {{for the next}} eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by <b>the</b> <b>keepers,</b> which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing {{was not the only}} one who served the light for a decade or more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|Around 1627, Robert Morton, {{the mayor}} of Hull, had an {{additional}} rectangular earthwork battery of four guns constructed around the south blockhouse to defend the estuary against a potential Spanish and French invasion threat. The South End Fort {{was built on the}} other side of the river from the South Blockhouse at the same time, provided supporting crossfire. In 1634, a survey showed the North Blockhouse to be mounting 24 pieces of artillery, the castle 29, and the South Blockhouse 24 guns. Catholic recusants continued to be detained in the castle and blockhouses, where they were ill-treated by <b>the</b> <b>keepers,</b> typically men with strong Puritan sympathies.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} faced by <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John Nicol was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in}} a dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they could be taken to the mainland. No lives were lost and Nicol and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{similarity}} between Skerryvore and Dubh Artach 20miles (32kilometres) {{to the south}} east, led to the NLB painting a distinctive red band round the middle section of the latter in 1890. The Hynish Shore Station {{had the advantage of}} proximity to the site during the construction period. However, the small harbour offered little shelter for shipping. <b>The</b> <b>keepers</b> operated from here until 1892 when operations were transferred to Erraid adjacent to the Isle of Mull. Other than the signal tower, the land and buildings on Tiree were sold to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll who had witnessed the laying of the first stone on Skerryvore fifty-two years previously. A paddle steamer, Signal, built by Laird of Greenock in 1883 was based at Erraid for relief operations. The shore station was moved to Oban in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of <b>the</b> <b>keepers.</b> However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>keepers</b> were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E
