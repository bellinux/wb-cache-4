The structure rotates to track the sun, which allows it to use a large amount of natural sunlight and warmth during the day. Several different energy generation technologies are used in the building, including a 603 sq ft dual-axis solar photovoltaic <b>tracking</b> <b>panel,</b> a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railing to provide heat and warm water. These in combination with the large amounts of insulation allow the Heliotrope to produce between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the gain in {{extraterrestrial}} radiation received by a single-axis <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> {{relative to a}} fixed panel was systematically analyzed over a specific period of time. The dynamic angle that the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> should rotate by in order to follow the sun was derived {{through a series of}} spherical trigonometric procedures. The instantaneous incident angle of sunlight upon the panel was then calculated, assuming that the panel would simultaneously follow the sun's position. Thus, instantaneous increments of solar energy received by the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> relative to the fixed panel are originally presented. The results show that the angle the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> has to rotate by is 0 Â° at solar noon, and increases towards dawn or dusk. The incident angle of sunlight upon the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> is always smaller than that upon the fixed panel, except at solar noon. As for panels installed with a yearly optimal tilt angle in Taipei, the gains are between 36. 3 % and 62. 1 % for four particular days of year, between 37. 8 % and 60. 8 % for the four seasons and 49. 3 % over the entire year. The amount of radiation collected by the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> is enhanced as the maximum rotation angle is increased. The irradiation ratio of the <b>tracked</b> <b>panel</b> to the fixed panel is close to 1. 5 for latitudes below 65 Â° and gradually increases for latitudes above this. The yearly optimal tilt angle of a south-facing fixed panel is approximately equal to 0. 9 multiplied by the latitude (i. e. 0. 9 Â xÂ [phi]) for latitudes below 65 Â° and is about 56 Â +Â  0. 4 Â xÂ ([phi]Â -Â  65) otherwise. <b>Tracked</b> <b>panel</b> Rotation angle Incident angle Extraterrestrial radiation Gain...|$|R

40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy supply {{is required in}} Malaysia to meet the increasing electricity demand with rapid growing in population and economy. Photovoltaic solar panel is most suitable alternative way to generate electricity in Malaysia where most of its location receives large number of solar radiation throughout the year. However, fixed solar panel is more preferred than <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> because it is cost effective. In present work, the power output and efficiency of single-axis tracking solar panel is compared with fixed solar panel by experimentally in East Coast Malaysia. A single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> produces higher power output than fixed panel up to 28 W. During this time, the average efficiency of <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> was about 66. 70 % and fixed panel was 39. 96 %. Hence, the percentage increment on average power output using <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> reached up to 66. 92 % compare to fixed panel during this period. The <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> module efficiency was higher than fixed panel {{for the same period}} and can reach up to 28. 9 % at 6. 00 p. m. In conclusion, single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> is more efficient than fixed panel in premeridian and postmeridian. Thus, it produces higher power output than fixed panel which means it utilize the most of available solar radiation effectively and this will reduce payback period of the initial investment cost...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{electric}} energy from a photovoltaic module was calculated theoretically at different azimuths and tilt angles in Taiwan. The gain of the module {{mounted on a}} single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> relative to a traditional fixed panel was analyzed. To simulate different operation environments, both types of radiation will be considered in addition to observed radiation, i. e. the extraterrestrial radiation and the global radiation predicted by an empirical model. The {{results show that the}} optimal tilt angle obtained from the observed data is flatter than those from other two radiation types and becomes flatter while the panel deviates from due south. The yearly gains obtained from the extraterrestrial, predicted and observed radiations are 51. 4 %, 28. 5 % and 18. 7 %, respectively, if a single-axis tracked panel is installed with the yearly optimal tilt angle; the similar gains are 45. 3 %, 25. 9 % and 17. 5 %, respectively, while the panel is adjusted to its monthly optimal angle each month. The amount of yearly energy in due west (or east) is less than its maximum in due south by about 11 %, 10 % and 5 % for the extraterrestrial, predicted and observed radiation respectively. The yearly conversion efficiency of a fixed module is 10. 2 %, 9. 2 % and 8. 3 % for the extraterrestrial, predicted and observed radiation, respectively.

40|$|Hourly typical {{meteorological}} year (TMY 3) {{data was}} utilized with the Perez radiation model to simulate solar radiation on fixed, azimuth tracking and two axis tracking surfaces at 217 geographically diverse temperate latitude sites across the contiguous United States of America. The optimum tilt angle for maximizing annual irradiation {{on a fixed}} south-facing panel varied from being equal to the latitude at low-latitude, high clearness sites, to up to 14 Â° less than the latitude at a north-western coastal site with very low clearness index. Across the United States, the optimum tilt angle for an azimuth <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> {{was found to be}} on average 19 Â° closer to vertical than the optimum tilt angle for a fixed, south-facing panel at the same site. Azimuth tracking increased annual solar irradiation incident on a surface by an average of 29 % relative to a fixed south-facing surface at optimum tilt angle. Two axis tracking resulted in an average irradiation increase of 34 % relative to the fixed surface. Introduction of manual surface tilt changes during the year produced a greater impact for non-tracking surfaces than it did for azimuth tracking surfaces. Even monthly tilt changes only resulted in an average annual irradiation increase of 5 % for fixed panels and 1 % for azimuth tracked surfaces, relative to using a single optimized tilt angle in each case. In practice, the decision whether to manually tilt panels requires balancing the added cost in labor and the panel support versus the extra energy generation and the cost value of that energy.

40|$|The initial aim of {{this project}} was to create an {{ethernet}} (IEEE 802. 3) Communications System. The system was to connect Embedded controllers to facilitate the operation of a real time operation. After extensive investigation and scheduled meetings with industry, {{it became apparent that}} a superior communication system for this type of task lay in the Controller Area Network (CAN) standard. Communications Networks are extremely susceptible to volatile surroundings. A vital controller network necessitates that its communication network be invulnerable to high noise levels. It is also imperative that critical messages from one controller reach their destination on time. CAN was conceived by BOSCH as a solution to this dilemma. The project undertaken was to develop a controller area network, whose purpose was to control a solar tracker in a remote fashion. The solar tracker developed needed {{to be able to work}} in an autonomous fashion via its own embedded controller, however be able to receive commands from a remote control unit. This remote unit was able to display the status and operation mode of the tracker, yet also be able to issue over ridding commands to the tracker in a real time sense. A CAN network was created and interfaced to a MC 68 HC 11 embedded controller. A two wire differential (RS 485) system was implemented as the physical CAN bus. Every aspect of interfacing the CAN (Intel 82527) device to the HC 11 was investigated. Chip Select problems resulted in the simulation of the of the HC 11 Address/Data bus using a MC 68 HC 24 Port Replacement Unit (PRU), even the possibility of Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) connection was considered before a hardware solution was developed. The driver software and low level communication system developed addresses all aspects of operation, from initialisation of the 82527, to dealing with the reception and transmission of various messages. Software to enable simultaneous network communications and solar tracking operation was completed for the solar tracking device. Every message object type was utilised within the system. The generation interrupts to deal with the reception of critical messages, and other message prioritisation schemes were incorporated. The resulting system demonstrated that the controller was able to drive a solar <b>tracking</b> <b>panel</b> and receive additional commands and issue status reports to a remote micro controller, in a real time situation. Such a system as this could have many solar trackers connected to the same bus and result in a cheap but reliable installation. Alternatively virtually any Industrial distributed automated process confined within a relatively close proximity could be developed by using a derivative of such a system described within this report...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{determine}} the energy losses in the shock absorber of the freight car whose wheel-set moves in the derailed state on the <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> depending on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Methodology. On the basis of spring suspension construction analysis and operating principle of the friction shock absorber of the freight car bogie the authors provide the method for determining the energy absorbed by it. The calculations take the maximum values of the absorber elements displacement and the regulatory values of spring suspension parameters. Findings. The authors obtained the calculated formula for determining the energy absorbed by shock absorber for regulation-set mounting schemes of elastic bogie elements depending on the axial load. The mentioned curves are parabolic. Originality. The work examines the crash mode of the wheel-set movement on the <b>track</b> <b>panels</b> after its derailment. It is shown that the energy dissipation in the shock absorbers is the reason for increase in resistance to rolling stock movement. The formulas for calculating the amount of energy dissipated in the shock absorber with a maximum displacement of its elements are derived. This energy depends on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Practical value. The proposed method allows setting the value of the additional resistance to motion that occurs in crash mode which makes it possible to increase the accuracy of traction calculations...|$|R

30|$|Where {{there is}} {{significant}} yaw movement, part of the yaw rotation is manifested as a distributed curvature along the track bridge and part as concentrated rotations at the ends. The extent of each is governed by the lateral bending stiffness of the frame {{made up of the}} (longitudinal) rails and the (transverse) bearer bars. The fasteners that connect the rails to the bearer bars allow some rotation, and if fasteners with no longitudinal restraint are used, then the rotation is essentially free, so that system is flexible and promotes distributed curvature along the track bridge. Guard rails mounted rigidly in the <b>track</b> <b>panel</b> provide more frame action, make the track bridge stiffer, and thus force more of the total rotation into the concentrated rotations at the ends of the track bridge.|$|R
