25|$|<b>Tametraline,</b> a {{compound}} synthesized in 1978 by Pfizer, {{was shown to}} be a potent NE and DA re-uptake inhibitor with animal studies. Later on a surprisingly substantial enhancement of blocking activity of 5-HT uptake was achieved by adding chlorine atoms at C-3 and C-4 to the structure of <b>tametraline,</b> resulting in (+)-trans-(1R,4S)-N-methyl-4-phenyl-1-aminotetralin, a potent but nonselective uptake blocker. The (+)-cis-(1S,4S)-isomer, one of four compounds diastereomers, however exhibited significantly more selective and potent 5-HT uptake inhibiting activity compared to the other three diastereomers, where the 4-phenyl ring favours attachments at 5-HT uptake sites. The compound was named sertraline (figure 8). Although sertraline appears to differ structurally from the other SSRIs, it has a phenylaminotetralin in its structure, in which the diphenylpropylamine nucleus has been forced into a stiff bicyclic ring system.|$|E
25|$|Tatsumi et al. (1997) found Ki {{values of}} {{sertraline}} at the human SERT, DAT, and NET of 0.29, 25, and 420nM, respectively. The selectivity of sertraline for the SERT over the DAT was 86-fold. In any case, {{of the wide}} assortment of antidepressants assessed in the study, sertraline showed the highest affinity of them all for the DAT, even higher than the norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) nomifensine (Ki = 56nM) and bupropion (Ki = 520nM). Sertraline also has similar affinity for the DAT as the NDRI methylphenidate (Ki = 24nM). <b>Tametraline</b> (CP-24,441), a very close analogue of sertraline and the compound from which sertraline was originally derived, is an NDRI that was never marketed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{sertraline}} {{dates back to}} the early 1970s, when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds based on the structure of the neuroleptic chlorprothixene. Further work on these compounds led to lometraline and then to <b>tametraline,</b> a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of <b>tametraline</b> was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the <b>tametraline</b> series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored <b>tametraline</b> derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not [...] "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even [...] "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.|$|E

50|$|Nomifensine (Merital, Alival) is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, i.e. a {{drug that}} {{increases}} the amount of synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine available to receptors by blocking the dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters.
