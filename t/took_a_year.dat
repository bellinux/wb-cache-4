5|$|After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> {{away from}} swimming, {{scheduling}} a {{return for the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation. From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were substantiated when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games. Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury.
