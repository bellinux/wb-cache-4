I offer an instrumental-variables approach <b>to</b> <b>retrieving</b> an estimate of the causal response of marijuana use to sanctions and thereby demonstrate the efficacy of school-imposed penalties as a deterrent to adolescent drug use. This is the first evidence of such efficacy and, given what is known about the consequences of drug use, suggests that school sanctions may have important long-run benefits. drug, crime, adolescent, risky behavior, expulsion...|$|R
