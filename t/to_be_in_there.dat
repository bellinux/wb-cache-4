2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to my mind, as a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway are going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
