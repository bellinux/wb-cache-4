500|$|When Jackson {{began the}} Off the Wall project {{he was not}} sure what he wanted as the final result; however, he did not want another record <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> The Jacksons, but rather he wanted more {{creative}} freedom, something he had not been allowed on prior albums. Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E

[...] Soon afterward, Winehouse's father commented that when he had made public statements regarding her problems he was using the media because it seemed {{the only way to get}} through to her. In an interview with The Album Chart Show on British television, Winehouse said she was manic depressive and not alcoholic, adding that <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> [...] "an alcoholic in denial."

500|$|Vonnegut was {{an admirer}} of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, {{particularly}} the Beatitudes, and incorporated it into his own doctrines. He also referred to it in many of his works. In his 1991 book Fates Worse than Death, Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, [...] "anything <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American". In Palm Sunday, he wrote that [...] "the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade." [...] However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the televangelists of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.|$|E

500|$|According to Yokota, he {{was under}} the {{impression}} that Mario was suited for children, causing him to create [...] "cute" [...] music that would appeal to the targeted audience. Three months later, Yokota presented three different styles of music to Miyamoto: one piece had an orchestral sound, the other had pop music, and the last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music. Miyamoto chose the orchestral piece, as it sounded the most [...] "space-like". Yotaka stated that Miyamoto chose the piece without knowing that Kondo actually wrote it. In a retrospective interview, Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded [...] "space-like" [...] because he was looking for a sound that would express the game, in contrast to the tropical sounds of Super Mario Bros. Yotaka revealed that he initially struggled to create music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a Super Mario game, but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had [...] "become natural".|$|E
500|$|After {{a day or}} so, Adams' family {{began searching}} the city for him, placing notices in several {{newspapers}} such as the New York Courier and Enquirer and the New York Weekly Tribune notifying people he was missing. A neighbor of Colt's, Asa H. Wheeler, told Adams' father-in-law, Joseph Lane, {{that he had heard}} noises in Colt's office <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a fight followed by a crash to the floor. Peering in the keyhole, he saw someone [...] "bending over something on the floor". [...] Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams. Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself. Colt made no reply to the implied allegation, and excused himself.|$|E
500|$|As free jazz {{spread in}} the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In {{comparison}} with what John Litweiler describes as Taylor's [...] "endless forms and contrasts," [...] the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them {{a central part of}} his improvisations; in Palmer's description, he executed [...] "glass-shattering tone clusters <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered to unplug it from its overdriven amplifier." [...] Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor's innovations with the form. European free jazz pianists who have contributed {{to the development of the}} tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach.|$|E

500|$|Before the album's release, M.I.A. {{said that}} audiences {{found it hard}} to dance to {{political}} songs. This made her keen to produce music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> pop but addressed important issues. [...] "Sunshowers", with its lyrical references to snipers, murder and the PLO, was written in response to the Tamil Tigers being considered terrorists in some quarters. She said, [...] "you can't separate the world into two parts like that, good and evil. America has successfully tied all these pockets of independence struggles, revolutions and extremists into one big notion of terrorism." [...] The lyrics caused controversy; MTV censored the sounds of gunshots in the song and MTV US refused to broadcast the video unless a disclaimer that disavowed the lyrics was added. The BBC described the lyrics as [...] "always fluid and never too rhetorical" [...] and sounding like [...] "snatches of overheard conversation". The songs deal with topics ranging from sex to drug dealing.|$|E
500|$|During rehearsals {{and even}} during {{the run of the}} show, the music was {{repeatedly}} revised by Rodgers in an attempt to gear the songs to Traubel's voice. According to Bruce Pomahac of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, [...] "as she began to get cold feet about what her New York fans would think about her as a belter, the keys of each of her numbers edged upward." [...] One of Traubel's numbers saw three different versions before being scrapped in favor of, according to Pomahac, [...] "something <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> an excerpt from Traubel’s Vegas act." [...] "All At Once You Love Her" [...] saw some popularity when recorded, during the run of the show, by Perry Como; in what Pomahac speculates was an attempt to appease Traubel, a reprise of the song was added for her, and provided [...] "one of the loveliest moments in all of Pipe Dream". The Organization announced that a new vocal score would be published in 2012, though it has not appeared as of 2017—the existing score reflects revisions made when Nancy Andrews took over the part.|$|E
500|$|Despite the album's track {{order not}} being decided {{until the very}} end, Yamaguchi had thought {{from the start that}} [...] "Ame wa Kimagure", [...] "Malaysia 32" [...] and [...] "Uneri" [...] should be in that order. After plans for [...] "Ame wa Kimagure" [...] to become the leading song were scrapped, Yamaguchi decided to {{elaborate}} on the [...] "oriental" [...] feel of the song. [...] "Malaysia 32" [...] is the band's first instrumental song, and was based on a synthesizer riff made by the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band. The song was called [...] "Malaysia" [...] because of how at one point they added a vocal melody <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the name of the city Kuala Lumpur. The number 32 in the title is a reference {{to the fact that the}} song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 bars. Originally [...] "Uneri" [...] had been envisioned as a rock song, but the band decided against this after creating [...] "Night Fishing Is Good". The band's musical director suggested that they perform the song acoustically instead, which led to the final studio arrangement of [...] "Uneri".|$|E

Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it.

500|$|Suda {{wrote the}} game's script in an improvisational manner, {{aiming for a}} lighthearted {{atmosphere}} that sometimes even mocked the game's design. The main reason for this {{was that he had}} fully immersed himself in the grim atmosphere of The Silver Case, and he wanted a change both for himself and his next game. Returning staff from The Silver Case included scenario co-writer Masashi Ooka and character designer Takashi Miyamoto; the change to a lighter atmosphere proved difficult for Miyamoto when designing the characters. Despite the differing aesthetics, the overall visual design was deliberately similar to that of The Silver Case. The music was composed by Masafumi Takada, who had previously worked on The Silver Case, and Shingo Yasumoto. The soundtrack incorporated remixed and re-orchestrated versions of classical music. The idea of using classical music was suggested by Suda: he told the sound designers to create a score <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> lounge music, but some considered tracks could not be used due to licensing issues. Due to budgetary constraints, voice acting could not be included, with characters instead being given garbled vocals [...] "that sounded like random foreign languages".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes: [...] "I did like the driving, {{collective}} muscle of the band, though, very much," [...] but he also describes its aesthetics as [...] "cluttered and gaudy". For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a cheesy video-game soundtrack." [...] Writing in The Times, John Bungey comments that [...] "many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept", concluding his review with: [...] "If you prefer hi-fi to sci-fi, then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time." [...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E

500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E
500|$|Slayer is {{considered}} a thrash metal band. In an article from December 1986 by the Washington Post, writer Joe Brown described Slayer as speed metal, a genre he defined as [...] "an unholy hybrid of punk rock thrash and heavy metal that attracts an almost all-male teen-age following". Describing Slayer's music, Brown wrote: [...] "Over a jackhammer beat, Slayer's stun guitars created scraping sheets of corrosive metal noise, with occasional solos <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> squealing brakes, over which the singer-bassist emitted a larynx-lacerating growl-yowl." [...] In an article from September 1988 by the New York Times, writer Jon Pareles also described Slayer as speed metal, additionally writing that the band [...] "brings the sensational imagery of tabloids and horror movies" [...] and has lyrics that [...] "revel in death, gore and allusions to Satanism and Nazism." [...] Pareles also described other [...] "Big Four" [...] thrash metal bands Metallica and Megadeth as speed metal bands. Slayer's early works were praised for their [...] "breakneck speed and instrumental prowess," [...] combining the structure of hardcore punk tempos and speed metal. The band released fast, aggressive material. The album Reign in Blood is the band's fastest, performed {{at an average of}} 220 beats per minute; the album Diabolus in Musica was the band's first to feature C tuning; God Hates Us All was the first to feature drop B tuning and seven-string guitars tuned to B. AllMusic cited the album as [...] "abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach," [...] with some fans labeling it as nu metal.|$|E
500|$|The Escapist, {{thinking}} {{the issues of}} a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took [...] "vigorous exception" [...] to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. <b>That</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E
