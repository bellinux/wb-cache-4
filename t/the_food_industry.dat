Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact statistics {{for the amount of}} food wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on food waste, it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector. Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away.|$|E

5|$|Sectors of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> (manufacturing and retail) {{have pledged}} {{to reduce the amount}} of food they {{directly}} waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> <b>food</b> <b>industries</b> in Iran {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a 'sunrise industry', {{with a huge potential}} for uplifting the agricultural economy, creating large scale processed food manufacturing and food chain facilities and resulting in the generation of employment and export earnings. Due to <b>the</b> importance of <b>Food</b> <b>Industries</b> in Iran this paper estimated and investigated the efficiency in this industry. The stochastic frontier approach is applied. The result showed that the measure of the average technical inefficiency of <b>the</b> Iranian <b>food</b> <b>industries</b> was 26 %. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>industries</b> of Iran are only 74 % technically efficient. The important factors that affect on efficiency in <b>food</b> <b>industries</b> of Iran are Education (ED), skilled (SK), specialization (SP) and workers insurance (IN).
