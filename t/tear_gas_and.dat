5|$|The {{situation}} was worse in Huế, where Diệm had banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those {{who engaged in}} civil disobedience. At 13:00, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế for a rally, having gathered at the Bến Ngư Bridge near the Perfume River.

5|$|Heydrich's assailants hid in safe {{houses and}} {{eventually}} {{took refuge in}} Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the church's crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire, <b>tear</b> <b>gas,</b> <b>and</b> by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves. Supporters of the assassins {{who were killed in}} the wake of these events included the church's leader, Bishop Gorazd, who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days protests intensified, {{moving to the}} Royal Court in Riffa, a royal palace in Safiriyya and finally blocking roads leading to the financial district in Manama. Security forces clashed with protesters using <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> rubber bullets, but police were overwhelmed by protesters. The government then requested help from neighbor countries, which sent about 1,500 security forces to assist the government. A state of emergency was declared and the government launched a crackdown campaign to put down protests by force. The Pearl Roundabout, now cleared of protesters, was torn down by government and protesters found themselves pushed back into their villages. The government arrested over 1,000 protesters including leading opposition and rights activists (known as the Bahrain Thirteen) as well as sportsmen, academics, businessmen, doctors, engineers, journalists and teachers.|$|E
5000|$|This {{conflict}} with the Oxnard Police Department and the [...] "upper tier" [...] of society continued in the 1940s as the zoot suit culture emerged. Officers frequently detained, stripped, shaved and confiscated offending clothing from young men and women. In 1942, {{a group of men}} and women listening to outdoor music were <b>tear</b> <b>gassed</b> <b>and</b> brutally arrested, leading to greater apprehension within the community to deal with the authorities.|$|R

5|$|It still {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks {{attacked}} their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious tanks of the 203rd NVA Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, backed up by an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, <b>tear</b> <b>gas,</b> <b>and</b> flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, but around 15 different types of tear gas have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became {{bogged down in}} the face of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> smoke bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5000|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that TRPA1 is activated {{by a number of}} reactive [...] (allyl isothiocyanate, cinnamaldehyde, farnesyl thiosalicylic acid, formalin, hydrogen peroxide, 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>gases)</b> <b>and</b> non-reactive compounds (nicotine, PF-4840154) and considered as a [...] "chemosensor" [...] in the body. TRPA1 is considered as an attractive pain target {{based on the fact that}} TRPA1 knockout mice showed near complete attenuation of formalin-induced pain behaviors. TRPA1 antagonists are effective in blocking pain behaviors induced by inflammation (complete Freund's adjuvant and formalin).|$|R

5|$|The day of 14 August {{witnessed}} heavy {{deployment of}} security forces, which used <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed {{in response to}} Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama. On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{breaking}} into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, {{with the objective}} now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes. Whereas standard US Army practice was to seal, blow up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke, <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> explosives before quickly moving on, the Australians spent {{the next few days}} laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers. Led by MacGregor, the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically tackled the tunnels, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. Small-scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired <b>tear</b> <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
