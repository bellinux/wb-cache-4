60|$|The sketch {{represents}} {{a section of}} the pack-saddle, at the place where one of the hooks is situated on either side, but the front of the kegs themselves, and not their section, is given. Above and between the kegs lies a bag, and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes over the whole burden, and is buckled to a similar short strap on the other side. It is of importance that the bung-hole should be placed even nearer to the rim than where it is drawn, for it is necessary that it should be convenient to pour out of and to pour into, and that it should be placed on the highest part of the keg, both when on the beast's back and also when it stands on the ground, lest water should leak and be lost. According to the above plan, when water is ladled into it, the rim keeps it from spilling; and in pouring out water, the run acts as a spout. In making the bung-hole, a metal plate, with a screw-hole in it, is firmly fixed {{in the face of the}} cask; into this a wooden stopper, bound with iron, is made to screw (natives would probably steal a metal one). The stopper has a small head and a deeply-cut neck, by which it is tied to the cask, and its body has a large hole bored in it, which admits of a stick being put through, to prize it round, if it should become jammed. A spigot, to screw into the bung-hole on arriving at camp, might be really useful; but if used, a gimlet-hole must be bored in the cask to act as an air-vent. A large <b>tundish</b> is very convenient, and a spare plug might be taken; but a traveller, with a little painstaking, could soon cut a plug with his own knife, sufficiently well made to allow of its being Firmly screwed in, and of retaining the water, if it had a bit of rag wrapped round it. A piece of rag rolled tightly, will suffice to plug a hole.|$|E

Procedures exploiting finite volume (FV) methods in both structured and unstructured meshes have recently been developed which enable this influence to be modelled {{in the context of}} conventional FV CFD codes. A range of problems have been tackled by the authors, including electromagnetic pumps and brakes, weirs and dams in steelmaking <b>tundishes</b> and interface effects in aluminium smelting cells. Two cases are presented here, which exemplify the application of the new procedures.

40|$|This paper investigates two {{batching}} {{problems for}} steelmaking and continuous-casting (SCC) production {{in an integrated}} iron and steel enterprise. The tasks of the problems are {{to make the decisions}} as how to consolidate ordered slabs into charges, and then how to group charges into casts. The effective decisions on these batching problems can help to balance the requirements of materials in downstream production lines, improve the customer satisfaction levels, and reduce production costs (including reduction of open ordered slabs, less slabs quality upgrading, reduction of steel-grade changeovers, and reduction of inefficient utilization of <b>tundishes</b> lives). We first formulate the problems as integer-programming models by consider practical constraints and requirements, and then develop the two heuristic algorithms for the corresponding batching problems. By embedding above models and algorithms, we develop decision support system (DSS) software with interactive planning editor. The DSS has been tested by using practical data set collected from the steelmaking plant in Baosteel {{which is one of the}} most advanced iron and steel enterprises in China. Computational experiments demonstrate that the models and algorithms developed can generate the satisfactory solutions when they work together with the planning editor in the DSS.

50|$|In metal casting, a <b>tundish</b> is a broad, open {{container}} {{with one or}} more holes in the bottom. It is used to feed molten metal into an ingot mould so as to avoid splashing and give a smoother flow. The <b>tundish</b> allows a reservoir of metal to feed the casting machine while ladles are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the moulds and cleaning the metal. Metallic remains left inside a <b>tundish</b> are known as <b>tundish</b> skulls and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting). A casting <b>tundish</b> is lined with refractory bricks specific to the liquid metal which is being cast.|$|E
50|$|From the ladle, the {{hot metal}} is {{transferred}} via a refractory shroud (pipe) to a holding bath called a <b>tundish.</b> The <b>tundish</b> allows {{a reservoir of}} metal to feed the casting machine while ladles are switched, thus acting as a buffer of hot metal, as well as smoothing out flow, regulating metal feed to the molds and cleaning the metal (see below).|$|E
50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new <b>tundish</b> is required, as any uncast metal in the <b>tundish</b> cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the <b>tundish</b> (although this can increase wear on the <b>tundish),</b> or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the <b>tundish</b> temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|E
40|$|The {{accomplished}} investigations {{about the}} drying process of refractory concrete {{are of interest}} for the refractory industry, whose world-wide sold products are mainly used in the steel industry. In the recent years {{a considerable amount of}} refractory companies replaced their products with new technology: monolithic refractory materials - castables. The success of these materials is due to their numerous advantages. They have better insulation, the lining can be cast in a shorter period of time and the linings can be easily fit to different slopes. However, castables have to be dried at the customerÂ´s premises. This drying process should under economical and environmental considerations be done as quickly as possible and too high vapour pressure should not occur. In order to improve the existing drying rules, prior measurements were undergone both, in the laboratory and in-situ. These measurements are very time-consuming and expensive. Additionally to various results in the past, the present doctorate contains numerical simulations where the most important mechanisms within the drying process of microporous, moisture containing refractory concretes are described. Beside the mass and energy transfer, adequate empirical equations to simulate the drying process are summarized. The developed model is tested by two different ultra low cement castables used as working linings of steel ladles and as safety linings of <b>tundishes.</b> The numerical results are compared with those obtained by prior experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|Background Steel {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most important industries of each country and noise pollution {{is one of the}} very annoying factors in this industry that causes various diseases; above all, the damage to the auditory system of the work force is high. Therefore, the assessment of noise pollution and the identification of the sources and causes of its creation are inevitable for controlling and teaching the prevention programs and hearing protection. Objectives This study aimed to draw the noise map of isosonic curves and assess the noise pollution using Surfer modeling software. Materials and Methods In the present study, first, preliminary maps and stationing were drawn, and then, the measurement of the sound pressure level and the octave band analysis were performed by a noise measurement device called Casella-CEL 445; then, after recording the data in software of Surfer version 8, they were used for drawing the isosonic curves. Results The results of the peripheral measurements showed that the maximum sound pressure of level 109 dBA was related to the electric arc furnace. A map of the graphic isosonic curves showed most of the noise pollution in the following areas: furnace, casting, <b>tundishes,</b> and the cooling beds. Conclusions According to the factory noise map, except for the control rooms with 81 dBA noise, other cases of measuring stations were higher than the standard exposure of 85 dBA noise. As a result, the implementation of control strategies, such as inspection and performance of control systems and insulation of the control room to prevent unnecessary exposure noise, are necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of reliable, high powered plasma generators {{has resulted in}} many plasma processes being proposed as alternatives to existing pyrometallurgical technologies. This work evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of plasma systems by reviewing plasma generators, their integration with reactors and the process economics. Many plasma systems were shown to be technically and economically superior to existing technologies, but some of the plasma system advantages quoted in the literature were found to be impractical because of other system constraints. Process applications were limited by the power inputs available from plasma generators compared to AC electric furnaces. A series of trials were conducted where chromite and steelplant baghouse dusts were smelted in the Tetronics' 2. 0 MW transferred arc/open bath reactor to confirm the operating characteristics of the plasma system and its economics. Chromite smelting was technical superior to submerged arc furnace technology, but the economics were unfavourable because of the limited power available from the water-cooled plasma torch and the high electrical energy consumption. A DC graphite electrode plasma furnace using preheated and prereduced chromite concentrates will compete economically with the submerged arc furnace. Ni, Cr and Mo were economically recovered from high alloy content steelplant dusts for recycling. Five Electric Arc Furnace dusts were smelted to produce a non-toxic residue and recover the contained zinc to an enriched zinc oxide product for recycling. It should be possible to condense the zinc vapour directly in a zinc splash condenser to increase the value of the product. Because of the limited power available from plasma generators, plasma processes will be most suitable for treating high and medium value materials such as Au, Pt, Mo, Ni, Ti, V, Cr etc at small production rates, heating metals in <b>tundishes</b> and ladles and remelting superalloy scrap. The treatment of environmentally hazardous waste materials is a particularly interesting application because of the additional financial incentives. Non-transferred arc plasma generators will be used for air and gas preheating in blast furnaces to reduce metallurgical coke consumptions...|$|R
50|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} and other fluid flow techniques {{are being used}} extensively {{in the design of}} new continuous casting operations, especially in the <b>tundish,</b> to ensure that inclusions and turbulence are removed from the hot metal, yet ensure that all the metal reaches the mould before it cools too much.

50|$|Metal is {{drained from}} the <b>tundish</b> through another shroud {{into the top}} of an open-base copper mold. The depth of the mold can range from 0.5 to 2 m, {{depending}} on the casting speed and section size. The mold is water-cooled to solidify the hot metal directly in contact with it; this is the primary cooling process. It also oscillates vertically (or in a near vertical curved path) to prevent the metal sticking to the mold walls. A lubricant (either powders that melt on contact with the metal, or liquids) is added to the metal in the mold to prevent sticking, and to trap any slag particles - including oxide particles or scale - that may be present in the metal and bring them {{to the top of the}} pool to form a floating layer of slag. The shroud is set so the hot metal exits it below the surface of the slag layer in the mold and is thus called a submerged entry nozzle (SEN). In some cases, shrouds may not be used between <b>tundish</b> and mold ('open-pour' casting); in this case, interchangeable metering nozzles in the base of the <b>tundish</b> direct the metal into the moulds. Some continuous casting layouts feed several molds from the same <b>tundish.</b>|$|E

40|$|Employed {{either in}} metal holding ladles/ <b>tundishes,</b> stopper rods, or metal {{delivery}} shrouds/ nozzles; the service life of refractory bodies {{plays an important}} role in the commercial feasibility of continuous casting of steel. A suitable selection of oxideâgraphite refractory material for a specific application is usually based on the fundamental understanding of its high temperature corrosion behaviour. Slag attack is particularly important. The structural strength of refractory may be critically reduced by the solvent action of liquid slags. Typically, in the conventional method of the continuous casting of liquid steel whether refining slags in the metal holding ladle, or casting powder in mould â they are almost always composed of high basic oxide constituent (CaO) concentration. Therefore, corrosion studies having CaO as one of the constituent oxides, has been the subject of many research work. However, with the advent of modern nearânetâshape continuous casting of steel not only thin walled refractory bodies are being employed but role and composition of meniscus slags has also changed making the control of corrosion a big challenge. The lack of available information on the corrosive action of the menisci slags of the modern continuous casting of steel, which are usually composed of high MnO and SiO 2 contents (having no or very little concentration of CaO), on the refractory bodies needs to be thoroughly studied. In general, uncertainties also exist regarding the fraction of graphite content in the refractory mix because an increase of the graphite content of refractory does not always minimize corrosion process. An experimental study, using static corrosion test, was conducted at the usual steel casting temperature (1550 C) to develop a fundamental understanding by comparing the transient progresses of corrosion reactions of several commonly available oxideâgraphite refractory in their interaction with menisci slags that are generated during the nearânetâshape casting of liquid steel. Factors such as the presence of solid fractions and the low wetting characteristic of molten slag phase seems to promote the entrapment of gas bubbles at the vi interface, which was found to favourably impact the corrosion resistance property of refractory by minimizing its contact with the corrosive slag phase. MgOâgraphite refractories showed higher resistance to the corrosive actions of both the menisci slags due to the formation of two inhibitive layers: a thin layer of dense MgO and Olivine phase. It has also been found that the corrosion performance of some oxideâgraphite refractory completely changes with the change of meniscus slag composition. Exhibiting different corrosion behaviours against the two menisci slags, refractories composed of (YâPSZ) ZrO 2 as oxide aggregate phase while performed poorly in interaction with ternary meniscus slag, a satisfactory corrosion performance of the refractory was noted when it interacted with binary meniscus slag composition. Examining the effect of graphite content on the corrosion performances of refractories by ternary meniscus slag (MnOâSIO 2 âAl 2 O 3), we found that while an inverse relationship existed for Al 2 O 3 âgraphite refractory, the corrosion performance of MgOâgraphite refractory improved when these were composed of higher graphite contents...|$|R
50|$|While {{the large}} amount of {{automation}} helps produce castings with no shrinkage and little segregation, continuous casting is of no use if the metal is not clean beforehand, or becomes 'dirty' during the casting process. One of the main methods through which hot metal may become dirty is by oxidation, which occurs rapidly at molten metal temperatures (up to 1700 Â°C for steel); inclusions of gas, slag or undissolved alloys may also be present. To prevent oxidation, the metal is isolated from the atmosphere as much as possible. To achieve this, exposed liquid metal surfaces are covered - by the shrouds, {{or in the case of}} the ladle, <b>tundish</b> and mould, by synthetic slag. In the <b>tundish,</b> any inclusions that are less dense than the liquid metal - gas bubbles, other slag or oxides, or undissolved alloys - may also float to the surface and be trapped in the slag layer. While the <b>tundish</b> and mold fill for the first time at the start of a casting run, the liquid is badly contaminated with oxygen and the first items produced are typically quarantined or diverted to customers who do not require top-quality material.|$|E

5000|$|Spray forming, {{also known}} as spray casting, spray {{deposition}} and in-situ compaction, is a method of casting near net shape metal components with [...] microstructures via the deposition of semi-solid sprayed droplets onto a shaped substrate. In spray forming an alloy is melted, normally in an induction furnace, then the molten metal is slowly poured through a conical <b>tundish</b> into a small-bore ceramic nozzle. The molten metal exits the furnace as a thin free-falling stream and is broken up into droplets by an annular array of gas jets, and these droplets then proceed downwards, accelerated by the gas jets to impact onto a substrate. The process is arranged such that the droplets strike the substrate whilst in the semi-solid condition, this provides sufficient liquid fraction to 'stick' the solid fraction together. Deposition continues, gradually building up a spray formed billet of metal on the substrate.|$|E
