5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and his friends — Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy — are swept away by a giant wave. They get separated from each other; SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward find themselves stranded on a remote tropical island. To get back home to Bikini Bottom, they search for Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru who can <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> gnarly surf moves to hit the elusive wave, The Big One, in order to return home.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E

25|$|The Land Development program (Vietnamese: Khu dinh điền): In early 1957, Diệm {{started a}} new program called the Land Development to {{relocate}} poor inhabitants, demobilized soldiers, and minority ethnic groups in central and southern Vietnam into abandoned or unused land in Mekong Delta and Central Highland, and cultivating technological and scientific achievements to transform South Vietnam and ensure security and prevent communist infiltration. Diệm believed that the program would help improve civilians' lives, <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> values of being self-reliant and hard working. At the end of 1963, the program had built {{more than two hundred}} settlements for {{a quarter of a million}} people. Nevertheless, the lacks of conditions in these areas along with the corruption and mercilessness of local officials failed the program.|$|E
25|$|According to Ojibwe oral history, seven great miigis (radiant/iridescent) beings {{appeared}} {{to them in}} the Waabanakiing (Land of the Dawn, i.e., Eastern Land) to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> mide way of life. One of the seven great miigis beings was too spiritually powerful and killed the people in the Waabanakiing when they were in its presence. The six great miigis beings remained to teach, while the one returned into the ocean. The six great miigis beings established doodem (clans) for people in the east, symbolized by animal, fish or bird species. The five original Anishinaabe doodem were the Wawaazisii (Bullhead), Baswenaazhi (Echo-maker, i.e., Crane), Aan'aawenh (Pintail Duck), Nooke (Tender, i.e., Bear) and Moozoonsii (Little Moose), then these six miigis beings returned into the ocean as well. If the seventh miigis being had stayed, it would have established the Thunderbird doodem.|$|E

500|$|As AGF commander, McNair {{worked to}} solve the problem of how to {{integrate}} replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. [...] Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. [...] In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. [...] New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{confirms}} the suspicion widely expressed in circles of Latin American literature that North Americans {{choose not to}} differentiate between political and economic exile. Alvarez pointedly demonstrates the North American tendency to undervalue cultural diversity by highlighting instances of American ignorance toward distinctions between different Hispanic-Caribbean groups. The García girls are quite conflicted upon their arrival in the United States as they find that distinct cultural groups are lumped together under one broad [...] "immigrant" [...] category and newcomers are encouraged to assimilate silently to the American norm. Yolanda’s conflict with her father regarding the potentially controversial speech she has prepared for the Teacher’s Day Address provides {{a classic example of}} {{the manner in which the}} García girls are pressured to conform to the norm. Yolanda feels as though she has sacrificed her principles and sold out to the hyper-sensitive authorities when her father forces her to discard her empowering, rebellious achievement of artistic self-expression for [...] "two brief pages of stale compliments and the polite commonplaces on teachers. A speech wrought by necessity and without much invention". Julie Barak affirms that [...] "although this incident is in many ways a defeat for both Yolanda and her mother, it does <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> lesson of conformity that is so important to living peacefully in America. Yolanda learns to fit in, to do the expected". The girls go on to attend the best schools, lose their Spanish accents and acquire the same psychological disorders as their upper-class American counterparts. Sandra battles anorexia, Carla and Yolanda both have failed marriages, Yolanda and Sandra are both institutionalized for psychiatric issues at one time or another, and Sofía is impregnated out of wedlock.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 August 1897 Father Auguste Huys {{arrived at}} Mpala, {{and after a}} few months was made {{director}} of the catechist school. [...] He founded the first junior seminary in the Congo.

Victor Roelens, he brought all the most pious and best behaved pupils to Mpala and began to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> elements of Latin grammar. Soon after, Father Joseph Weghsteen created a Latin-Swahili grammar, which he printed on the press at Mpala. A history of the church and other works were also printed.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately thereafter, Spofford {{organized}} {{a group of}} Christian Science students to provide financial support to Glover (so that she might continue to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> tenets of her religious beliefs) and to rent a meeting space for them. He also set up several offices around the area to practice Christian Science healing, and began calling himself [...] "Dr. Daniel Spofford." [...] When Glover had difficulty finding a publisher for her book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Spofford acted as publisher, while fellow students George Barry and Elizabeth Newhall put up {{the money for the}} publication. Spofford even distributed handbills alongside Glover to promote the book. He also introduced Glover to her future husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy. Glover and Eddy soon married, and Spofford was called on to help arrange the ceremony. The now-Mrs. Eddy continued to call on Spofford for assistance in handling the mental drain of her many students and the preparations for the second edition of her book.|$|E

We <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> idea and then we {{show them how to}} sell it". The next 15 years saw the opening of 30 more chiropractic schools, including John Howard's National School of Chiropractic (now the National University of Health Sciences) that moved to Chicago, Illinois. Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had {{the power of the state}} at their disposal, immediately had them arrested. There were only 12,000 practicing chiropractors with more than 15,000 prosecutions for practicing medicine without a license in the first 30 years. D.D. Palmer was also jailed for practicing medicine without a license. Tom Morris and his partner, Fred Hartwell, were able to successfully defend 80% through the UCA.

2500|$|In 1964, Shabalala had {{a series}} of {{recurring}} dreams during his sleep, over a period of six months, featuring a choir singing in perfect harmony. Shabalala described this as a beautiful sound, and one not yet achieved by his group of the time. As a result, he reformed the group, bringing on board newer (younger) relatives but keeping the group name. He strove to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> harmonies from his dreams, creating what was to become a signature tune for the group: [...] "Nomathemba" [...] (a girl's name - meaning [...] "hope"). After deciding that this group well replicated the beautiful, soft sounds from his dreams, Shabalala entered the group into isicathamiya competitions, held on Saturday nights in the halls of hostels in Durban and Johannesburg. The group managed to win nearly every competition that was held. As a result, Shabalala decided to change the name of the group to be more descriptive of its talent. The name [...] "Ezimnyama" [...] was replaced by [...] "Ladysmith Black Mambazo".|$|E
2500|$|According to Noble David Cook, a {{community}} of scholars have recently, albeit slowly, [...] "been quietly accumulating piece by piece data on early epidemics in the Americas and their relation to subjugation of native peoples." [...] They now believe that widespread epidemic disease, to which the natives had no prior exposure or resistance, was {{the primary cause of}} the massive population decline of the Native Americans. Earlier explanations for the population decline of the American natives include the European immigrants' accounts of the brutal practices of the Spanish conquistadores, as recorded by the Spanish themselves. This was applied through the encomienda which was a system ostensibly set up to protect people from warring tribes as well as to <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Spanish language and the Catholic religion, but in practice was tantamount to serfdom and slavery. The most notable account was that of the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas, whose writings vividly depict Spanish atrocities committed in particular against the Taínos. It took five years for the Taíno rebellion to be quelled by both the Real Audiencia—through diplomatic sabotage, and through the Indian auxiliaries fighting with the Spanish. After Emperor Charles V personally eradicated the notion of the encomienda system as a use for slave labour, there were not enough Spanish to have caused such a large population decline. The second European explanation was a perceived divine approval, in which God removed the natives as part of His [...] "divine plan" [...] {{to make way for a}} new Christian civilization. Many Native Americans viewed their troubles in terms of religious or supernatural causes within their own belief systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as}} [...] "so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way {{that you want to}} rub noses in it— the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> formulas for 'hit films.'" [...] Richard Corliss of TIME wrote, [...] "It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in." [...] In Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "The miracle of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new." [...] "You get intoxicated by it," [...] wrote Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman, [...] "high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does." [...] "There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive", wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. [...] "Pulp Fiction is indisputably great." [...] Overall, the film attained exceptionally high ratings among U.S. reviewers: a 94% score based on 78 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 9.1/10, the site's consensus reading, [...] "One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones". It has an average score of 94/100 based on 24 reviews on Metacritic.|$|E
