5|$|In Giessen, Forester Ritter {{was arrested}} {{because he said}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> last another three years. Two years ago R. was assassinated because he {{maintained}} that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> last two years.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{legacy of the}} Battle of Long Island was that it showed {{there would be no}} easy victory, and that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> be long and bloody.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes. Fortunately for them, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> soon end.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a premonition}} to World War I that Marc {{experienced}} living in Germany. The {{brutality of the}} animals lives at the depicted moment reflected what <b>the</b> oncoming <b>war</b> <b>would</b> be doing {{to the people of}} the world. The destruction, the chaos, and the sadness that the viewer sees sums up the evident outcome <b>the</b> future <b>war</b> <b>would</b> bring.|$|R

50|$|Serving as a gunner {{with the}} 83rd Battery during <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Haldane was {{stationed}} at Chatham. After peace was declared in 1945, he recognised immediately that the glittering social world of between <b>the</b> <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> never be <b>the</b> same again, then a chance encounter with Michael Powell, the film director, {{led him to}} two years' work at Pinewood Studios.|$|R
5|$|During 1943, Bulleid began {{planning}} for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified {{the need for a}} stop-gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>would</b> require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> not be won quickly, the Navy department decided {{to replace the}} six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union and the West {{spent nearly}} 50 years on <b>the</b> brink of <b>war.</b> During {{conflicts}} like the Cuban Missile Crisis the tensions escalated {{to the point}} where it seemed as if <b>the</b> Cold <b>War</b> <b>would</b> turn into an actual weaponized war. Brinkmanship was one of the steps prior to <b>the</b> point where <b>war</b> <b>would</b> actually break out.|$|R
50|$|Adam Smith {{argued in}} the Wealth of Nations that, as {{societies}} progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies, <b>the</b> spoils of <b>war</b> <b>would</b> rise but that <b>the</b> costs of <b>war</b> <b>would</b> rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.|$|R

5|$|Increasing violence, {{especially}} by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the American Revolution, as some hoped that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.|$|E
5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> shape his {{military and political}} life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5000|$|The KGB {{believed}} that the Third World rather than Europe was the arena in which it could win <b>the</b> Cold <b>War.</b> Moscow <b>would</b> in later years fuel an arms buildup in Africa. In later years, African countries used as proxies in <b>the</b> Cold <b>War</b> <b>would</b> often become [...] "failed states" [...] of their own.|$|R

5|$|Stevens {{played a}} major part in {{the passage of the}} Legal Tender Act of 1862, when {{for the first time the}} United States issued {{currency}} backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency issues to the amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century, until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. When it became apparent that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead’s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} part {{he would play}} in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> occur at the Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led {{the greater part of}} the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} {{the morale of}} the Albanians. There were few, if not any, officers and soldiers who deserted afterwards. The battle of Albulena has been seen as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory over the Ottomans. However, it also marked the high point of the Albanian resistance, beginning a new phase in Skanderbeg's quarter-century long war which would include its fiercest Ottoman invasions. Even though Skanderbeg himself had died in January 1468, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> drag on until 1478 and later in the same year the main Albanian fortress at Krujë fell, finally effecting the annexation of Skanderbeg's Albania by the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|When it {{appeared}} that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> resume, four of the New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a defensive compact known as the United Colonies of New England. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, {{and he was the}} chief architect of the United Colonies. His experience in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national government.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Pohl, along with Georg von Müller, the Chief of the Imperial Naval Cabinet, and Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, believed that since <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>would</b> be over quickly, the fleet should be preserved intact. Together, they agreed that the fleet should be restrained to provide local defense of the German coast, rather than seek a decisive battle against the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. Pohl argued that U-boats should be used to attack British merchant shipping. He pushed for fewer restrictions on the conduct of the commerce war beginning in late 1914; he further advocated abandoning the cruiser rules that handicapped the German effort, in favor of unrestricted submarine warfare. He presented his first plans for an unlimited commerce war in November 1914, but these were rejected by the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg so as not to antagonize neutral nations, in particular the United States.|$|E
