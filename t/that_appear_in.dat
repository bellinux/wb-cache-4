50|$|In linguistics, a {{polarity}} item is a lexical item <b>that</b> can <b>appear</b> only <b>in</b> environments {{associated with}} a particular grammatical polarity - affirmative or negative. A polarity item <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> affirmative (positive) contexts is called a positive polarity item (PPI), and one <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>in</b> negative contexts is a negative polarity item (NPI).|$|R
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods {{of several hundred}} nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Tolkien {{pretends to}} be merely the {{translator}} of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the Red Book of Westmarch. He says that those names and terms in the work (as well in the earlier The Hobbit) <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> English {{are meant to be}} his purported translations from the Common Speech.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Trident {{contains}} peristyle panels {{with the}} motif of a black dolphin situated around a red anchor and black tridents against a white background. The theme suggests that {{the owners of the}} house were somehow connected to maritime pursuits. These simple, two-dimensional mosaics stand in contrast to the multicolored, finely-detailed, three-dimensional Hellenistic mosaics of figures and motifs. They are perhaps comparable or even linked to the black-and-white pavement mosaics <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Roman Italy some decades later.|$|E
5000|$|The Cinebox was a coin-operated Italian 16mm film {{projector}} juke box type machine invented <b>in</b> 1959 <b>that</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> Europe to rival the French made Scopitone [...] <b>that</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> 1960.

50|$|The {{succession}} {{letter is}} based on a real-world tradition in which each outgoing President of the United States leaves a letter for his successor in the Oval Office.

5|$|The same {{elements}} from the myth <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the Pyramid Texts recur in funerary texts written in later times, {{such as the}} Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE). Most of these writings were made for the general populace, so unlike the Pyramid Texts, they link Osiris with all deceased souls, not exclusively with royalty.|$|E
5|$|The site's {{history and}} {{background}} is given, along with commentary from Wikipedia founders Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Commentators <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the film include author Howard Zinn, Len Downie of The Washington Post, Bob Schieffer of CBS News, former Encyclopædia Britannica chief Robert McHenry and former Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey. The documentary discusses incidents that shed a negative light on Wikipedia, including the Essjay controversy and the Wikipedia biography controversy.|$|E
5|$|Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provide guest {{speaking}} roles, with {{additions to}} the regular voice cast {{in the form of}} Keith Alexander and Gary Files. The design of the puppets <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Thunderbird 6 marks a transition between the caricatures that Century 21 had used up to Thunderbirds Are Go and the realism introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. Filming ran from May to December 1967, and the art and special effects departments collaborated to realise Skyship One as both a miniature model and a collection of themed interior designs. A number of sequences of the Tiger Moth in flight were filmed on location with a full-sized stunt plane, but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport regarding alleged dangerous flying by pilot Joan Hughes forced the production team to film the remaining shots in-studio with scale replicas.|$|E

5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|Biggs and Wedge, {{inspired}} by two Star Wars {{characters of the}} same name, appear in numerous titles as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later titles in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos and Moogles. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> several installments {{as a means of}} long-distance travel for characters. Moogles, on the other hand, are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna. They serve different capacities in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate titles.|$|E

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By breaking up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Melee are trophies, statuettes {{of video}} game {{characters}} and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects, such as Mario and Link, or other characters and items <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> their respective series. A minigame, the Coin Launcher, replaces the lottery machine from Melee {{as the primary}} method of obtaining trophies. The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|E

Other brief appearances {{were made in}} the television series Agatha Christie's Marple, The Two Ronnies, French and Saunders and Foyle's War. A sequence of sketches <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> each episode of Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, was shot in the old Jo Pip's / Cunninghams theatre venue on Seaside Road, which has since been developed into flats. The 1993 BBC drama series Westbeach was filmed on location in Eastbourne and surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media {{franchise}} {{and shared}} universe that {{is centered on}} a series of superhero films, independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. Phil Coulson, portrayed by Clark Gregg, is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across all the different media of the MCU.|$|E
5|$|The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) {{television}} series are American superhero television shows based on characters <b>that</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> publications by Marvel Comics. The shows {{have been in}} production since 2013, {{and in that time}} Marvel Television and ABC Studios, along with its production division ABC Signature Studios, have premiered six series, with seven more in various stages of development, across broadcast, streaming, and cable television on ABC, Netflix and Hulu, and Freeform, respectively. The ABC series have averaged around 4–8 million viewers a season, with many of the MCU series receiving strong critical responses.|$|E
