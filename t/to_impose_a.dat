5|$|In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further {{encouraged}} Henry {{to advance}} {{the integration of the}} Irish Church with Rome.

In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} tried <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> {{system of}} crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Longinus {{sent the}} royal {{treasure}} and Albsuinda to Constantinople, the Empire's capital, together with Helmichis' forces, which {{were to become}} Byzantine mercenaries.

These are believed to be the same 60,000 Lombards that are attested by John of Ephesus as being active in Syria in 575 against the Persians. As for Albsuinda, the Byzantine diplomacy probably aimed to use her as a political tool <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> pro-Byzantine king on the Lombards. According to Agnellus, once Longinus' actions {{came to the attention of}} emperor Justin II they were greatly praised, and the emperor gave lavish gifts to his official.|$|E

Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan.|$|E

5|$|However, {{according}} to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, {{a rise in the}} market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.

In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E
