In this paper, {{we report on}} numerical and experimental investigations of this plasma <b>transfer</b> phenomenon. <b>The</b> two <b>tubes,</b> source and <b>transfer,</b> are perpendicular {{to each other in}} ambient air with a 4 mm separation with both tubes being flushed with Ne or a Ne/Xe gas mixture at 1 atmosphere pressure. The primary IW is generated in the source tube by ns to μs pulses of ± 25 kV, while <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> is electrodeless, not electrically connected to the first and at a floating potential. The simulations are conducted using a two-dimensional (2 D) plasma hydrodynamics model with radiation transport, where the three-dimensional tubes in the experiments are represented by 2 D channels. Simulations and experiments show that the primary IW propagates across the inter-tube gap and upon impingement induces two secondary IWs propagating in opposite directions in <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube.</b> Depending on <b>the</b> polarity of the primary IW in the source tube, the secondary IW in <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> can have polarities either the same or opposite to that of the primary IW.

The measurements included particle and temperature profiles at the tailpipe, {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> exhaust gas <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> to <b>the</b> dilution tunnel (anaconda), at the diaphragm of the dilution tunnel, 1, 5 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm and 10 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm (normal sampling point).

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of the {{inflammatory}} process, monocytes and granulocytes constitute important effector cells that must function correctly in order to clear infection. By activating leukocytes in vitro it is possible to mimic the in vivo activation of these cells and study their activation potential. However, in vitro activation may not tell the entire story: cells that have been exposed to inflammatory mediators in vivo could have an altered response when activated in vitro. The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the functional response, with different activation markers, of peripheral granulocytes and monocytes, in relation to selected inflammatory conditions. Peripheral leukocytes from blood donors are frequently used as control cells in laboratory tests. It is known that blood sampling and separation techniques can affect the quantitative levels of activation markers on leukocytes. In the first study we therefore investigated the influence of two different blood sampling procedures, in a blood donation setting, on peripheral granulocytes. We found that a brief contact with <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> generated an ex vivo activation of peripheral neutrophils probably due to activation of the complement system within <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tube.</b> During coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) a whole body inflammatory response occurs, and the heart-lung machine (CPB) has been thought to be the major contributor to this phenomenon. In the second and third part of this thesis we evaluated the impact of the CP 13 on peripheral phagocytes during CABG. Patients were randomised to surgery with (ONCAB) or without (OFFCAB) CPB. We could demonstrate less complement activation in OFFCAB compared to ONCAB patients during and 24 hours after CABG surgery. Despite this finding, both neutrophil and monocyte adhesion molecule expression was similar for both patient groups. The cells responsiveness to in vitro activation was also similar. Neutrophil numbers increased during and after CABG surgery whereas the number of circulating eosinophils decreased considarably. We also found a selective decrease in the numbers of CD 14 +/CD 16 + monocytes during surgery. Both neutrophils and monocytes are activated as a consequence of CABG without apparent additional effects of CPB. The investigated parameters indicate that the surgical trauma could be the most important factor contributing to the enhanced inflammatory response noted during cardiac surgery. In the last part of the study we investigated the systemic influence of a chronic inflammatory condition, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), on peripheral blood phagocytes. We found that neutrophils, monocytes and eosinophils from both COPD patients and asymptomatic smokers have an impaired oxidative burst in vitro compared to those from non-smokers. In addition patients and smokers also have vascular involvement as determined by elevated levels of sICAM 1. There were no differences in adhesion molecule expression or mobilisation between the studied groups although smoking had an acute effect on CD 11 b mobilisation in COPD patients. These findings may in part explain why COPD patients show increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis demonstrate the value of monitoring peripheral granulocytes and monocytes during acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. In vitro activation is a helpful tool for examining the responsiveness of circulating phagocytes...|$|R

Besides, if the heat stored is released, it can supply heat for buildings or raise the road surface temperature for snow melting in winter. A road-solar energy system was built in this study, and <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> mechanism and effect of the system were analyzed according to the monitored solar radiant heat, the solar energy absorbed by road and the heat stored by soil. The results showed that the road surface temperature was mainly affected by solar radiation, but the effect is hysteretic in nature. The temperature of the solar road surface was 3 °C– 6 °C lower than that of the ordinary road surface. The temperature of the solar road along the vertical direction was 2 °C– 5 °C lower than that of the ordinary road. The temperature difference increased as the distance to <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tubes</b> decreased. <b>The</b> average solar collector efficiency of the system was 14. 4 %, and the average solar absorptivity of road surface was 36 %.

40|$|AU Rights ReservedTo Jeanne, my bride to be. OLGT bi~fhdays {{were special}} this year. I {{would like to}} thank the {{following}} people for help, advice, and encouragement throughout this project. Professor Hans W. Liepmann has my greatest admiration and respect. I particularly appreciate the freedom and support that he gave me to pursue research topics of my choosing. It is my hope that some of his enthusiasm to understand and his ability to do so will rub off. Thomas Roesgen greatly aided the author by introducing him to the computer as a practical lab research tool. He also provided constant evaluation, insight, and advice as acuities were encountered and surmounted (he also held the top end of <b>the</b> helium <b>transfer</b> <b>tube).</b> Bill Kath gave constant encouragement and friendship throughout the years here. He made several observations that forced the author to understand cer-tain helium experiments more clearly. Tim Turner, my predecessor, to use his own words has "generously enlightened the author about. the mysteries that persist in modern cryogeni...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{characteristics}} of flow pattern are investigated experimentally for evaporation of pure refrigerant HFC 134 a in a capillary tube of 1. 2 mm I. D. The capillary tube consists of a heating-copper tube section and a glass-tube section, which {{is located at the}} right after the outlet of the heating section. The flow pattern is observed through the glass tube section in the ranges of mass velocity of G= 80 ～ 1260 kg/(m^ 2 s) and vapor quality of x= 0. 008 ～ 0. 975 at a constant pressure of 920 kPa. The flow patterns observed are the bubble flow, the plug flow, the slug flow, the wavy annular flow and the annular flow. These flow patterns are typical for a relatively large diameter tube used as <b>the</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>tube</b> in commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. However the transition points between each flow pattern are different from the modified Baker map and the Taitel-Dukler map, which are proposed for a relatively large diameter tube...|$|R
