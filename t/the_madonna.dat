The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E

The most outstanding feature of St. Paul's Church is the Window of the Resurrection, a stained-glass window commemorating the Bell family that was originally intended for Westminister Abbey in London.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of <b>the</b> <b>Madonna</b> and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|Through the Wilderness is a psychedelic-folk {{tribute to}} Madonna without {{adhering}} {{to any particular}} coherent sound. The cover songs were composed differently from the original versions by the performers; they changed the melody of <b>the</b> <b>Madonna</b> tracks by tweaking the lyrics and re-interpreting the actual meaning. Music critics both complimented and criticized the songs, noting the strength of Madonna's discography in the album's track list.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Ansidei <b>Madonna</b> {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the strict expression of divinity of the Umbrian School within his Florentine Period. Above <b>the</b> <b>Madonna's</b> throne is inscribed [...] "Hail, Mother of Christ." [...] This compares to the more natural poses and interaction found in <b>Madonna,</b> <b>the</b> Christ Child and infant John the Baptist in paintings of his Roman period.|$|R

5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as <b>The</b> <b>Madonna</b> with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden depictions of <b>the</b> <b>Madonna,</b> {{her head is}} {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Jahangir first {{mentions}} his alterations to {{the fort}} in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana. Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling. British {{visitors to the}} fort noted Christian iconography during the Jahangir period, with paintings of <b>the</b> <b>Madonna</b> and Jesus found in the fort complex. In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.|$|E

5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} a {{hallmark}} of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid Descent, where the mourning figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and <b>The</b> <b>Madonna</b> Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, and because of the evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel to {{the eastern}} end of the choir dates from between 1265 and 1290. It is of three bays, and {{contains}} the Shrine of StWerburgh, dating from the 14thcentury. The vault of the Lady Chapel is {{the only one in the}} cathedral that is of stone. It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity, <b>the</b> <b>Madonna</b> and Child, and the murder of Thomas Becket. The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina.|$|E
5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate <b>The</b> <b>Madonna</b> Standing.|$|E

50|$|The {{collection}} of eleven songs written mostly by Lorber himself included several featured artists. Among them, Eric Benét, Paulinho da Costa, Paul Jackson, Jr., Michael Landau, Hubert Laws, Kongar-ol Ondar, CeCe Peniston, Kongar-ol Ondar, Paul Pesco (guitarist on <b>the</b> <b>Madonna's</b> <b>The</b> Virgin Tour), or Art Porter, Jr..|$|R
5|$|The chapel was {{dedicated}} to Our Lady of Sorrows (also called <b>the</b> <b>Madonna</b> di Pietà or Mater Dolorosa). After being deconsecrated in the late 19th century, the room was used for other purposes, and only the limestone frame, where {{used to be the}} titular painting which was retrieved during restoration works in 1991, still remains from the chapel's original interior. An ornate fountain is located at the building's main courtyard, above which is a niche with a statue and above it an elaborate sculpture of the coat-of-arms of Pinto. Similar to the fountain of the first Castellania on site, it was supplied by water from the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was completed early in van der Weyden's career, probably just after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended. Although highly accomplished, it {{is filled with}} symbolism of a kind absent from his more mature works. It is one of three attributed paintings, all early works, that show the Virgin and Child set within an architectural setting, surrounded with painted sculptural figures, the others being <b>The</b> <b>Madonna</b> Standing and the Durán Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{historical}} significance rests {{both on the}} skill behind the design and its merging of earthly and divine realms. By positioning himself in the same space as <b>the</b> <b>Madonna,</b> and showing a painter {{in the act of}} portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society. The panel became widely influential with near copies by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula and Hugo van der Goes.|$|E
