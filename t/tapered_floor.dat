50|$|The smaller {{building}} (chlorinator) is rectangular in {{plan with}} the longer elevations facing south-west and north-east. Two square, metal-framed windows, covered with metal shutters open into {{both of these}} elevations. A square window into the north-west elevation is also covered with sheeting. The entrance to the building, in the south-east elevation, is via a concrete stair which ascends parallel to the wall finishing at a concrete landing. A wooden door opens from the landing. This is secured with a knob and a more recent lock. The top of the tank under the smaller building forms a raised semicircular concrete plinth which extends to the south-west. The tank contains a chamber with a <b>tapered</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The church, {{originally}} consecrated to Saint Remigius, {{still has}} its Romanesque quire tower with its four <b>tapering</b> <b>floors.</b> The aisleless three-sided structure behind {{it was built}} on only in 1747 after the mediaeval nave had fallen into disrepair.|$|R

500|$|Édifice Price was {{constructed}} in the art deco style of the time, as was the neighbouring Clarendon Hotel, whose extension was completed a few years earlier. The design uses setbacks to gradually <b>taper</b> <b>floor</b> area down, yielding the typical elongated [...] "wedding cake" [...] shape which contributes in reducing loads and softens the building's visual impact on the city's skyline. The upper setbacks were later used to build balconies. Because the building is deeper than it is wide, it appears much bulkier when viewed from the side. This is reminiscent of Finnish art nouveau architect Eliel Saarinen's work, and is the stylistic opposite of other buildings in the city such as the Château Frontenac, whose cantilever construction widens as it gets taller.|$|R

Geometric motifs are carved in the Price Building's stone cladding, especially over the first few levels. The building is topped by a more classical, specifically Châteauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|R
2500|$|The wrecker had a Holmes twin-boom {{design with}} a {{swinging}} boom and powered hoist cable on each side. When towing the booms were rotated to the rear, connected at the ends, {{and worked as}} one A-frame. When lifting the booms could be separated and rotated 90% forward to the side, an outrigger could be lowered to increase lifting capacity. A power take-off on the transfer case drove a transmission with two winches in the wrecker frame. Controls {{on both sides of}} the body allowed each winch to raise or lower independently of the other. The body had low sides on the rear half which <b>tapered</b> to the <b>floor</b> in the front, making clearance for the boom to swing. A brace for the wrecker frame held a spare tire. Welding tanks, an air compressor, cables, block and tackle, chains, tow-bars, and other equipment were carried.|$|R
