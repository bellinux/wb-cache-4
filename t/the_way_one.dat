5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>one</b> describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} feature of Italian musical {{form in the}} 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic.

There are no Italian symphonists in this century, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>one</b> might speak of Brahms in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a Stabat Mater and his late Petite messe solennelle and Verdi Messa da Requiem and Quattro Pezzi Sacri.|$|E
25|$|From Biblical {{times to}} today, {{the most common}} form of prayer is to {{directly}} appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer.

God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>one</b> asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E
25|$|When the Confederate {{infantry}} {{cleared the}} Potomac River, accompanied or eventually joined by three other cavalry brigades, Stuart proceeded to ride through {{and around the}} Union Army in northern Virginia and central Maryland in order to harass and delay their movement, capture a wagon train of supplies, damage some communication and railroad property and to gather intelligence. Stuart's ride, which he could have abandoned early to allow return of his force to close contact with Lee's army, risked putting Stuart out of a position to provide timely intelligence and cavalry support to Lee. This risk was exposed as Stuart encountered several delays along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> of those delays {{was caused by the}} attack of the small Union cavalry force from the 11th New York Cavalry against Stuart's force of 2,000 men at Fairfax Court House on June 27, 1863. One of the more audacious actions by a small force against a much larger one during the war, the battle not only delayed Stuart's ride but cost the Confederates the life of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry's promising young commanding officer, Major John H. Whitaker. Stuart did not arrive at Gettysburg until the afternoon of {{the second day of the}} battle on July 2, 1863. Stuart's overall delay engendered considerable contemporary and future criticism and controversy concerning the value and conduct of his ride around the Union Army and its possible negative effect on the Confederate Army's operations and performance at Gettysburg.|$|E

500|$|The filmmaking {{style of}} David Lynch {{has been written}} about {{extensively}} using descriptions like [...] "ultraweird", [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "oddball". Todd McGowan writes, [...] "One cannot watch a Lynch film <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>one</b> watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films." [...] Through Lynch's juxtaposition of cliché and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing. Many of the characters in Mulholland Drive are archetypes that can only be perceived as cliché: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully. Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst writes of him, [...] "Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|When Gilmour {{joined the}} band, Pink Floyd {{performed}} briefly as a five-man piece, from 12 January till the 20th. For {{a handful of}} shows Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally joining in with the playing. In between these five-piece gigs, the group rehearsed a few Waters-penned songs on 15 and 16 January. During the next session on 18 January, the band, joined by Smith, jammed on rhythm tracks; Barrett didn't attend this session. On 24 and 25 January, the band recorded a song, logged as [...] "The Most Boring Song I've Ever Heard Bar 2" [...] at Abbey Road. The band recorded [...] "Let There Be More Light", [...] "Corporal Clegg" [...] (which features lead vocals by Nick Mason) and [...] "See-Saw" [...] all without Barrett, despite manager Andrew King claiming Barrett performed the slide solo {{at the end of}} [...] "Let There Be More Light".
