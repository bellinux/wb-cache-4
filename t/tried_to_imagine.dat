I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> {{what they were going}} through.

5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{exploring}} {{the effects of}} the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in science fiction novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, Earth Abides, portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, {{through the eyes of a}} survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: [...] "What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{later found}} out that when the {{material}} was recorded, Wilson had taken LSD. [...] "I've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what [...] must have been thinking", Zappa recounted, [...] "sitting in that control room, listening to all that weird shit {{coming out of the}} speakers, and being responsible for telling the engineer, Ami Hadani (who was not on acid), what to do." [...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Composer Kenji Kawai {{scored the}} film. For the main theme, Kawai <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the setting and convey {{the essence of}} that world in the music. He used Classical Japanese in the opening theme [...] "Making of a Cyborg". The {{composition}} {{is a mixture of}} Bulgarian harmony and traditional Japanese notes; the haunting chorals are a wedding song sung to dispel all evil influences. Symphony conductor Sarah Penicka-Smith notes that the song's lyrics are fitting for the union between Kusanagi and Project 2501 at the climax of the movie. Kawai originally wanted to use Bulgarian folk music singers, but used Japanese folk singers instead. [...] "See You Everyday" [...] is {{different from the rest of}} the soundtrack, being a pop song sung in Cantonese by Fang Ka Wing.|$|E

500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood. As a teenager, he worked at his parents' ceramic factory during the summers, hauling fifty pound molds around in the extreme heat of a kiln room. To Haarsma, it felt similar to what the children of his books might feel as slaves. In addition to these experiences, {{there is a more}} prominent influence on the premise of The Softwire—that is, there is a mystery of a journey to a new, unknown place to start a new life. Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did. While there, living in New York, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Haarsma [...] witnessed immigrants struggling to get by. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what caused them to risk everything, and to move to another country, and to have a chance at something better. It is this journey (and struggle) that is prevalent in The Softwire.|$|E
500|$|The vocals {{and lyrics}} were {{provided}} by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the Etrian Odyssey arrange albums. The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe {{wanted to work with}} her on Nier. She was approached {{a few months after the}} initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote [...] "Song of the Ancients" [...] in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Spice Up Your Life" [...] was {{directed}} on 6 September 1997, by Marcus Nispel in a two-day shoot located in New York City. The video features {{the group in}} a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, and the music video for Janet Jackson's 1989 single Rhythm Nation controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic post apocalyptic cityscape. Nispel {{came up with the}} concept based on a sketch that was faxed to him signed [...] "Ginger Spice". He recalls: [...] "I looked at what Disney did to Times Square in NYC and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how the Spice Girls would transform it, as their career seemed to have no limits—at the time." [...] The group was not consulted about the concept. According to Brown's autobiography, they wanted a carnival party theme, but were too tired to fight about it with the label, and ended up with a concept linked to the theme of world domination. Brown commented: [...] "It wasn't right. I don't think any of us liked it much, even though we enjoyed making it. I still can't understand what's going on in it half the time." [...] The video exclusively premiered on MTV in September 1997.|$|E

500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E
2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what a real Nazi {{might be}} like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy {{for its own}} sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't {{meant to be a}} political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well." ...|$|E

I felt that Averroës, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what a play is without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd than I, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> Averroës yet with no more material than a few snatches from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios." ...|$|R
