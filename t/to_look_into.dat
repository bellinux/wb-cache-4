5|$|In 1836 the Royal Commission on Public Records {{was formed}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> {{the loss of}} the {{parliamentary}} records, and make recommendations on the preservation of future archives. Their published recommendations in 1837 led to the Public Record Act (1838), which set up the Public Record Office, initially based in Chancery Lane.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj's {{successor}} as {{the spiritual}} head of BAPS, started to continue fulfilling {{the dream of}} his guru Yogiji Maharaj and prompted devotees <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the possibility of building the temple in Delhi. A request for the plan was put forward to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and several different places were suggested, including Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. Pramukh Swami Maharaj stood firm in following the wishes of Yogiji Maharaj to build a temple on the Yamuna.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated {{the properties of}} detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., surveyed the existing state of knowledge, they found several areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the Chapman–Jouguet model, which describes the way the shock wave created by a detonation propagates.|$|E

Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor {{paid for the}} services of a British security company, Control Risks. Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> one sighting.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

5|$|Pendulum Publications {{produced}} {{one more}} issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving New Worlds without a publisher. The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive New Worlds; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> what would be necessary to start a new company.|$|E
5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> their grievances.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the hallway.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its eyes on a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> the stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen {{was not able to}} secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E

Veronica visits Weevil in prison before she decides <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> a pizza {{delivered}} to Weevil’s house. Sheriff Lamb tells Keith that the ex-husband has disappeared before accusing Keith in the ex-husband’s disappearance. Keith thinks that Dean O’Dell {{was involved in the}} disappearance, but when he visits Dean, it turns out that Dean's wife and stepson have disappeared to a hospital in Mexico, presumably taking the ex-husband with them. Wallace visits a “tutor”, who gives him a mysterious “study guide” before going back to for the “answers.” Veronica notices the masks being used in a short film, but they were stolen. When they are in Mexico, Dean O’Dell reveals that he lied to Keith about their whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Born into an {{expatriate}} Ceylon Tamil {{family in}} Malaya, Chelvanayakam moved to Ceylon while still young. He {{worked as a}} teacher before studying law at Ceylon Law College and qualifying as lawyer. A successful career in civil law saw him becoming a King's Counsel and being offered {{a position on the}} Supreme Court, which he rejected. As a young lawyer Chelvanayakam was not involved in politics but when the British established the Soulbury Commission <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> constitutional reform in Ceylon he and other Tamil people formed the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) to represent Tamil interests. He was elected to Parliament in 1947 to represent Kankesanthurai, a constituency he would represent until his death, except for a period between 1952 and 1956. Chelvanayakam left the ACTC over the party's decision to join the government and in 1949 founded his own party, ITAK, also known as the Federal Party.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Oslo had {{two main}} railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. Serving as the {{terminal}} station of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (OsloV) {{was located in}} Vika, {{at the heart of}} the central business district of Oslo. The much larger Oslo East Station (OsloØ) served most commuter, regional and intercity trains. In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>into</b> a possible connection of the Drammen Line to OsloØ. Led by Axel Grenholm, the committee recommended building a branch from the Drammen Line as a tunnel under the city center, allowing all trains would terminate at OsloØ. It was proposed that the tunnel would run from Lassons gate west of OsloV to Fred. Olsens gate, with an intermediate station close to the location of OsloV.|$|E
