The series begins {{in the autumn of}} 2004, and concludes with an epilogue in the summer of 2005. Each episode revisits the students at an eventful <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> and concentrates on life events that pertain directly to transgender experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.|$|E

60|$|There {{never was}} a hero {{who did not have}} his bounds. I suppose it may be said of Nelson and all the others whose courage has been advertised that there came <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> when <b>their</b> bravery knew it had come to its limit.|$|R
5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then maximum wage for a professional footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{incidents}} in the book are actual situations that happened to the Ingalls family at that <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> as told to Laura by her Pa, Ma and sister Mary over the years. Because Laura was, in fact, 2 to 3½ years old while her family lived in Indian Territory during 1869–1870, and did not remember {{the incidents}} herself, Laura did more historical research on this novel than on any other novel she wrote, {{in an attempt to}} have all details as correct as possible.|$|E

25|$|Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is a common}} virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have at some <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or anal cancer. MSM and men with compromised immune systems {{are more likely than}} other men to develop anal cancer. Men with HIV {{are also more likely to}} get severe cases of genital warts that are hard to treat.|$|E
25|$|In 1630 Artemisia {{moved to}} Naples, a city rich with {{workshops}} and art lovers, {{in search of}} new and more lucrative job opportunities. Many other artists, including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Simon Vouet had stayed in Naples for some <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> At that time, Jusepe de Ribera, Massimo Stanzione, and Domenichino were working there, and later, Giovanni Lanfranco and many others would flock to the city. The Neapolitan debut of Artemisia {{is represented by the}} Annunciation in the Capodimonte Museum. She remained in Naples for the remainder of her career with the exceptions of a brief trip to London and some other journeys.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{other ethnic}} groups, Singaporeans of Chinese origin from all social {{backgrounds}} and occupations have achieved significant upward advances in their educational levels, income, and life expectancy and experienced other social indicators. Singapore's rapid industrialisation between the 1960s and the 1990s has lifted numerous {{people out of}} poverty and has created a broad middle class for many Singaporeans. During the period of rapid economic growth the process, many Chinese began experience upward social mobility for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> In 2000, Chinese Singaporeans represented the second highest proportion of University graduates after the Singaporean Indians.

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} linked smoking to anxiety disorders, {{suggesting}} the correlation (and possibly mechanism) {{may be related}} to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a major depressive disorder at some <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major depressive episode. Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifetime}} prevalence, or {{the proportion}} of individuals expected to stutter at one <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> is about 5%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. However, {{there is not much}} information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio. Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of {{children under the age of}} 5 stutter. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery, the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.|$|E
