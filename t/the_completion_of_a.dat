5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete {{the development of the}} P.1127.|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Clinical {{judgment}} {{provides the}} basis for nurses’ actions and {{is essential for the}} provision of safe nursing care. Tanner’s Clinical Judgment Model and its associated instrument, the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (LCJR) have been used in the discipline of nursing, yet it is unclear if scores on the rubric actually translate to <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action. This is important because clinical judgment involves identifying and responding to patient situations through nursing action, and then evaluation of such actions. The purpose of this observational study was to explore the relationship between clinical judgment, as measured by the LCJR, and <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action, as measured by a nursing action form. The clinical judgment and <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action was measured in 92 participant students at a Midwestern university school of nursing who were enrolled in an adult medical/surgical nursing course that included simulation and debriefing during which scoring occurred. This study explored whether clinical judgment, as measured by the LCJR, was related to <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action. In addition, this study evaluated whether Responding, as measured by the LCJR was related to <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action. The data revealed that a very weak relationship was present between clinical judgment, as measured by the LCJR, and <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action; however, these findings were not statistically significant. The data also revealed that a very weak relationship was present between the dimension Responding, and <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indicated nursing action; however, these findings were also not statistically significant. This study expands upon previous clinical judgment research in nursing and identifies a need for additional methods of evaluating clinical judgment in baccalaureate nursing students including action appraisal so that deficiencies are established and targeted for improvement...|$|R

5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service.

US25 while US25A became a part of the mainline highway to connect to I-94. In 1967, another segment, this time south of Detroit, was rerouted to follow another freeway, I-75.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901, the British Electric Traction Company {{applied to}} Parliament for an {{extension}} to Sale. The proposal was amended {{to continue the}} line further south, into Altrincham. The line through Sale was owned by Sale Urban District Council and leased to the Manchester Corporation. Services to Sale commenced in 1907. A branch along Northenden Road from the line to Sale Moor was created in 1912. Sale Moor's line had only a single track which in 1925 resulted in a head-on collision between two tramcars, injuring eight passengers. Bus services were first introduced to {{the area in the}} 1920s, but became more widespread in the 1930s. The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services, which from the 1930s went into decline. The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934, and throughout Sale in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, Baldwin {{noticed that}} the Norwalk Seminary, located in Norwalk, Ohio, was {{dissolving}} {{due to lack of}} funds. He approached Thomas Thompson, who was the elder of the Norwalk District (which included Cleveland and Berea), and asked him to visit Berea. At Baldwin's Old Red House, an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk Seminary. Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9, 1846. It was meant to open in 1845, but the process was delayed until <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building on Baldwin's farm, which was erected by Baldwin himself, made of stone quarried on his farm and brick made of clay. The institute was open to people of all races, male or female, as Baldwin wanted. It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855. The university later became Baldwin–Wallace College in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> section of the M3 {{motorway}} from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

Deacon William Morgan Jr. sold the house to John Wood in 1745. Nine years would pass before it would be reacquired by the Avery family in 1754.

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis.

The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of <b>the</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it.
