5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> As mentioned above, {{the effectiveness of}} rider lean varies inversely with the mass of <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves {{the view of the}} road, and improves <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
50|$|Cozy Yamakoshi {{served as}} the company's product {{development}} manager, designing <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> frames, coordinating <b>the</b> manufacture of <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> by Japanese manufacturers, and importing <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> into <b>the</b> US. Subsequently, around 1986, Centurion introduced their first Taiwanesebuilt model, the Signet. The Cinelli Equipe Centurion of 1985 (only) was a joint-venture of WSI and Cinelli of Italy.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> bear {{a passing}} {{resemblance}} {{to those used}} for speedway, but have a longer wheelbase and a more rigid frame. As with speedway, <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> do not have brakes.|$|R
50|$|Raleigh's sales agent, Mitchell Weiner, who {{was reading}} The New Centurions at the time, took receipt of <b>the</b> <b>bikes,</b> placed Centurion decals on <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> and marketed them successfully, {{subsequently}} forming Western State Imports after merging with Rick Wilson's company, Wil-Go of Santa Clara, California. Because <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> {{had all been}} intended as Raleigh Grand Prix models, as Centurions, they carried {{the colors of the}} Raleigh America Grand Prix model.|$|R
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two years}} of {{software}} errors in <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> share system, Motivate shut down the Citi Bike system over the last weekend of March 2015 to replace the existing system software with that of 8D Technologies. Since then, the Citi Bike system has continued to expand its installations using the 8D Technologies as its software and station equipment supplier. Through that summer, Motivate also refurbished all of the system's 6,000 bikes, as well as fixed the bicycle stations' kiosks and improved <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> docks at these stations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} Swing <b>Bike</b> was in <b>the</b> wheelie <b>bike</b> style, and <b>the</b> Swing <b>Bike</b> {{company also}} offered a normally-steered BMX bike in 1977. An early working name for <b>the</b> Swing <b>Bike</b> as Pivicycle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>biking</b> {{activities}} in <b>the</b> area are extensive {{and include a}} network of trails for Downhill mountain biking. These can be accessed either by biking uphill, using a vehicle to transport <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> or <b>the</b> popular Skyline Gondola option.|$|R
2500|$|Cycle {{magazine}} called the CB750, [...] "the most sophisticated production <b>bike</b> ever", on <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> introduction. Cycle World {{called it a}} masterpiece, highlighting Honda's painstaking durability testing, <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> [...] top speed, the fade-free braking, the comfortable ride, and excellent instrumentation.|$|R
5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean with respect to <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> {{in order to keep}} either the torso or <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> and this torque causes <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
50|$|The '26-inch' {{designation}} {{refers to}} the wheel diameter of <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> {{that may be used}} in the competition. As this is a standard diameter for a mountain <b>bike,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> used in 26-inch trials are also known as 'stock' bikes.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Helsinki city <b>bike</b> {{system is}} {{procured}} by Helsinki City Transport. The contract {{has been made}} for 10 years for a total value of 12 950 000 euros. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> and bike stations are supplied by Smoove, and Moventia is responsible for supplying <b>the</b> stations with <b>bikes</b> at even rates and for the upkeep of <b>the</b> <b>bikes.</b> Clear Channel Finland organizes project promotion and partnerships as a Moventia & Smoove subcontractor. Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto’s (HOK-Elanto’s) grocery store Alepa is the main cooperation partner of <b>the</b> city <b>bike’s</b> and supports <b>the</b> system’s implementation.|$|R
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> Utada sits down and starts <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
50|$|Bicycle Victoria offered {{entrants}} of the 2004 Great Victorian Bike Ride a bike, free of charge, if they registered {{early for}} <b>the</b> event. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were imported and distributed by Bicycle Victoria. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were available fully assembled, or partially assembled in a box.|$|R
25|$|In May 2014, over 40 {{bicycles}} {{were stolen}} from Baltimore Recreation and Parks department's bike-share program. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were stolen during the city's Ride Around Reservoir program in Druid Hill Park. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were set up to be lent out {{when a group of}} youths took them. The cost of replacing <b>the</b> stolen <b>bikes</b> is devastating to the program, which operates completely on donations.|$|R
50|$|The National Superstock 600 Championship is {{a support}} {{race for the}} British Superbike Championship, the superstock 600 meaning that all <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> have to be of a pretty stock spec, meaning <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> that are {{produced}} to ride for the public, with a maximum engine size of 600cc.|$|R
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards {{the direction in which}} <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5000|$|As Bridgestone {{were not}} known for their motorcycles, the public were {{generally}} skeptical about the 350 GTR, and <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> high price (close to the much bigger Triumph Bonneville) meant that sales were low; just 9,000 bikes were built between 1967 and 1971. This {{would be the last}} motorcycle that Bridgestone ever produced. However, reviewers both past and present have generally been very positive about the motorcycle. Cycle praised <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> engine, transmission and brakes, also stating that [...] "Never before have so many advanced features been incorporated into a single package." [...] Cycle World praised <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> styling, its comfortable riding position, and stated that it was [...] "as big and as fast as any 500." [...] Roland Brown of Motorcycle Classics praised <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> usability, and <b>the</b> responsive nature of the engine.|$|R
50|$|Three feeder paths {{lead from}} the Nibelungenstadt Worms, which belongs thematically {{to one of the}} most {{important}} locations of the Nibelungensage. The paths then lead through the Hessian Ried to the Nibelungensteig. The three feeder paths include two <b>biking</b> routes (<b>the</b> <b>biking</b> route “north” and <b>the</b> <b>biking</b> route “south”), and one hiking trail.|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|It's {{the true}} {{definition}} of hell. It's very dangerous, {{especially in the}} first kilometre when we enter it at more than 60kh. It's unbelievable. <b>The</b> <b>bike</b> goes in all directions. It will be a real spectacle but I don't know if it's really necessary to impose it on us.|$|E
5|$|LeMond's {{introduction}} to cycling came in 1975 thanks to freestyle skiing pioneer Wayne Wong, who recommended <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> {{as an ideal}} off-season training aid. LeMond started competing in 1976, and after dominating the Intermediate category (13–15) and winning the first 11 races he entered, he received permission to ride against older, more seasoned competitors in the Junior (16–19) category.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> Engers rode pioneered {{lightweight}} techniques, frequently featuring drilled out brakes, chainwheels {{and other}} components. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> were often {{designed and built}} by his friend and mentor, the late Alan Shorter.
