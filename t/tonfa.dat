2500|$|Members of the Okinawan {{upper classes}} {{were sent to}} China {{regularly}} to study various political and practical disciplines. The incorporation of empty-handed Chinese Kung Fu into Okinawan martial arts occurred partly because of these exchanges {{and partly because of}} growing legal restrictions on the use of weaponry. Traditional karate kata bear a strong resemblance to the forms found in Fujian martial arts such as Fujian White Crane, Tai Zu Quan or Grand Ancestors Fist, Five Ancestors, and Gangrou-quan (Hard Soft Fist; pronounced [...] "Gōjūken" [...] in Japanese). Many Okinawan weapons such as the sai, <b>tonfa,</b> and nunchaku may have originated in and around Southeast Asia.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>tonfa</b> {{may have}} {{originated}} as {{the handle of}} a millstone used for grinding grain. It is traditionally made from red oak, and can be gripped by the short perpendicular handle or by the longer main shaft. As with all Okinawan weapons, many of the forms are reflective of [...] "empty hand" [...] techniques. The <b>tonfa</b> is more readily recognized by its modern development {{in the form of}} the police Side-handle baton, but many traditional <b>tonfa</b> techniques differ from side-handle baton techniques. For example, <b>tonfa</b> are often used in pairs, while side-handle batons generally are not.|$|E

50|$|Although the <b>tonfa</b> is most {{commonly}} associated with the Okinawan martial arts, its origin is heavily debated. One of the {{most commonly}} cited origins is China, although origins from Indonesia to Thailand are also possible. Okinawan tradition derives the <b>tonfa</b> from a millstone handle. The Chinese and Malay words for the weapon (guai and topang respectively) literally mean crutch, which may suggest the weapon originating from the crutch. In Cambodia and Thailand a similar weapon is used consisting of a pair of short clubs tied onto the forearms, known in Thai as mai sok and in Khmer as bokgatau. In Thailand and Malaysia the mai sok often has a similar design to the <b>tonfa,</b> with a perpendicular handle rather than being tied on. This weapon might be the original version of the <b>tonfa.</b>|$|E
