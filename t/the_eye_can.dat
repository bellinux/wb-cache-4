5|$|The {{tears of}} the Eye of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>can</b> also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the Eye of Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover {{to be coming from}} a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing the name of the hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>can</b> kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E

25|$|Gross {{examination}} - {{the examination}} of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for histopathology. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> sometimes be aided with a magnifying glass or a stereo microscope, especially when examining parasitic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be {{directly}} affected {{in the form}} of episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> see, were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E
50|$|Frequently, {{amblyopia}} {{is associated}} with a combination of anisometropia and strabismus. In some cases, the vision between <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>can</b> differ to <b>the</b> point where one eye has twice average vision while <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> is completely blind.|$|R

25|$|On April 25, 2007, Sony {{announced}} the PlayStation Eye. This is {{an updated version}} of the PlayStation2 peripheral, the EyeToy. The camera is capable of capturing 60frames per second video at 640×480 resolution and 120 frame/s video at 320×240 resolution. The four-channel microphone on <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>can</b> block out background noise. The camera supports live video chat and voice chat without a headset, and was launched in the United States on October 23, 2007, for US$39.99, and in Australia on November 8, 2007, for A$79.95. It was also bundled with the card game The Eye of Judgment released in the United States on the same day as the camera itself for US$69.99, and in Japan and Australia on October 25, 2007 for JP¥9,980 and A$159.95, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause stroke-like episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min visual angle), but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to the way most primates move their eyes to focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used to}} digest tissues, as {{in a process that}} was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds that keep the flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with coffee-like appearance, and the only solid that remains are bone hulls, which could be crushed between one's fingertips. Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing roadkill dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors. Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian serial killer Leonarda Cianciulli used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap. In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it. Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability to hydrolyze protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> be more serious and can lead to blindness. This danger is often overlooked.|$|E
500|$|Eye {{prolapse}} is {{a common}} problem among Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds (see Brachycephalic syndrome) and {{can be caused by}} a trauma to the head or neck, or even by the owner using a tight leash instead of a harness.

500|$|Ra is {{not unique}} in this {{relationship}} with the Eye. Other solar gods may interact {{in a similar way}} with the numerous goddesses associated with the Eye.

Hathor can even be called [...] "the Eye of Horus"—one of several ways in which the distinctions between the two eyes are blurred. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>can</b> also act as an extension of and companion to Atum, a creator god closely associated with Ra.
