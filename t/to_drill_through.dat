The plot centers on the town of South Park, which has been overrun by hippies. Eric Cartman states [...] "Hippies can't stand death metal" [...] and proceeds <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> a hippie concert onto the main stage to change the audio to [...] "Raining Blood", making the hippies run away. King found the episode humorous and expressed {{his interest in the}} show, ending the interview with [...] "It was good to see the song being put to good use, if we can horrify some hippies we've done our job." [...] "Angel of Death" [...] also appears in several movies, including , at the point when the character Mohawk turns into a spider, , where it is played during a car stunt scene, and in the 2005 Iraq War documentary Soundtrack to War.|$|E
500|$|A major {{aspect of}} Sonic Colors {{is the ability}} to {{activate}} Wisp power-ups. There are eight different types of Wisps, each with their own unique advantage dependent on their color. Normal white-colored Wisps allow the player to get a speed boost at any time. The [...] "Cyan Laser" [...] turns Sonic into a laser that can bounce off solid surfaces to change the laser's path and to travel through power lines, while the [...] "Yellow Drill" [...] allows Sonic <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> soft ground and water. The [...] "Orange Rocket" [...] allows Sonic to blast upward to tremendous heights; the [...] "Pink Spikes" [...] allows Sonic to bond to walls and ceilings and to perform a spin dash to gain velocity and to destroy objects; the [...] "Green Hover" [...] enables Sonic to hover and to perform dashes across lines of rings; the [...] "Blue Cube" [...] gives Sonic the ability to turn blue blocks into blue rings and vice versa; and the [...] "Purple Frenzy", which turns Sonic into a berserker that chomps through anything in its path, increasing in size as it continues to eat.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E

2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to [...] long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E

50|$|Nailing margin is {{a process}} in which the {{manufacturer}} will intentionally leave 1” of foam off {{the top and bottom of}} the panel. This 1” area is meant to allow the installer <b>to</b> <b>drill</b> directly <b>through</b> the panel, without damaging, or compromising the pad. If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being screwed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable <b>to</b> be <b>drilled</b> into, like cinder block, then firing strip will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them.|$|R

50|$|In the process, {{segments}} of the existing strata can be disconnected and pushed upwards.
