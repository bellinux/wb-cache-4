From 1996 Beverley had Charter Trustees to maintain <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borough of Beverley: these {{were replaced by}} a Beverley Town Council in 1999, and Bridlington was parished in 1999.

5|$|The park officially {{came into}} {{existence}} on 5 March 2007 through a decree taken after advice by the Council of State. In April 2007, the Administration Council took office; between 2007 and 2009, personnel were employed and installations made on the site.

5|$|A {{period of}} {{national}} prosperity followed {{the end of}} the War of 1812. In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong demand for the state's goods led to land speculation becoming a popular enterprise. <b>The</b> <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Insurance Company in 1802 and the Bank of Kentucky in 1806 made currency for loans plentiful. The establishment of branches of the Second Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington further augmented the availability of credit. In 1818, the General Assembly chartered 40 more state banks, and later added six more.|$|E
5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company {{in partnership with}} the older and more experienced Michael Grubb, one of the directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E

5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna Carta and <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.|$|E
5|$|Later, the Finnish statesman J.K. Paasikivi {{commented that}} the Soviet attack, without a {{declaration}} of war, violated three different non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed 1932 and again in 1934, and further <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations. The invasion was judged as illegal by the League of Nations, which expelled the Soviet Union on December 14. Following the Soviet attack, C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. Furthermore, the Finnish government changed as Risto Ryti was appointed {{the new prime minister}} and Väinö Tanner as foreign minister.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{copies of}} the 1300 {{exemplification}} by Edward I survive, in Faversham, Oriel College, Oxford, the Bodleian Library, Durham Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the City of London (held in the archives at the London Guildhall) and Sandwich (held in the Kent County Council archives). The Sandwich copy was rediscovered in early 2015 in a Victorian scrapbook in the town archives of Sandwich, Kent, one of the Cinque Ports. In {{the case of the}} Sandwich and Oriel College exemplifications, the copies of <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest originally issued with them also survive.|$|E
5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was {{made clear that the}} appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative. King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort, whom some were already starting to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E

5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{problems}} with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, in particular that of upholding <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest. In the parliament of 1301, the King was forced to order {{an assessment of the}} royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession. Ultimately, it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against EdwardI. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign. As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant. Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.|$|E

The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.|$|E
