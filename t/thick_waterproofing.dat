50|$|The current combat boot {{used by the}} Norwegian {{armed forces}} is the M77. It was {{introduced}} in 1977 and is produced by Alfa Skofabrikk AS.The M77 boot took ten years to develop and strict requirements were set for weight, durability, water resistance, comfort, as well as ease of maintainece and good heat resistance to facilitate quicker drying.The Norwegian army frequently test boots from other manufacturers, however they have not made any plans to change boots for their soldiers. The M77 boot has notches along the sole and in the heel made for the NATO issue skis used by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The bindings for these skis fit the M77 boots {{as well as the}} <b>thick</b> <b>waterproof</b> outer shoes they can be put in. The boots can be used for skis as well as snowshoes.|$|R
50|$|Fly lines {{consist of}} a tough braided or {{monofilament}} core, wrapped in a <b>thick</b> <b>waterproof</b> plastic sheath, often of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In the case of floating fly lines, the PVC sheath is usually embedded with many 'microballoons' or air bubbles, and may also be impregnated with silicone or other lubricants to give buoyancy and reduce wear. In order to fill up the reel spool and ensure an adequate reserve {{in case of a}} run by a powerful fish, fly lines are usually attached to a secondary line at the butt section, called backing. Fly line backing is usually composed of braided dacron or gelspun monofilaments. All fly lines are equipped with a leader of monofilament or fluorocarbon fishing line, usually (but not always) tapered in diameter, and referred to by the 'X-size' (0X, 2X, 4X, etc.) of its final tip section, or tippet.|$|R
40|$|Horses {{and other}} equids are unusual in {{producing}} protein-rich sweat for thermoregulation, {{a major component}} of which is latherin, a highly surface-active, non-glycosylated protein that {{is a member of the}} PLUNC (palate, lung and nasal epithelium clone) family. Latherin produces a significant reduction in water surface tension at low concentrations (= 1 mg/ml), and probably acts as a wetting agent to facilitate evaporative cooling through a <b>thick,</b> <b>waterproofed</b> pelt. Latherin binds temporarily to hydrophobic surfaces, and so may also have a disruptive effect on microbial biofilms. It may consequently have a dual role in horse sweat in both evaporative cooling and controlling microbial growth in the pelt that would otherwise be resourced by nutrients in sweat. Latherin is also present at high levels in horse saliva, where its role could be to improve mastication of the fibrous diet of equids, and also to reduce microbial adherence to teeth and oral surfaces. Neutron reflection experiments indicate that latherin adsorbs to the air/water interface, and that the protein undergoes significant conformational change and/or partial unfolding during incorporation into the interfacial layer...|$|R
40|$|Prefabricated timber raft is {{water-based}} {{recreational vehicle}} for drifting on rivers without rapids. It is a floating deck measuring 4. 5 m (length) X 3. 2 m (width) with a carrying capacity of 800 to 900 kg; appropriate for eight adults. It {{is made up}} of three major components: (1) float made from eight polyethylene drums, (2) frame made from timber boards (50 X 50 mm), and (3) deck made from three pieces of 4 mm <b>thick</b> <b>waterproof</b> plywoods. The drums and timber boards can be made from used materials whereas new plywoods are required for safety and durability. Minor components such as oars, masts, canvas and a stowage compartment are installed to facilitate the rafting crew in their expedition. The fundamental scheme of this raft is that it can be assembled or dismantled by eight adults within 25 minutes, costing RM 650 - 800 and can be utilized for more than five times. It is a cheap recreational and eco-friendly mode to spend leisure activities without causing pollution to the river. The minimum drift duration is four days with average drifting speed of 4. 2 km/h covering a distance of 30 to 35 km per day...|$|R
50|$|Rainwater {{harvesting}} {{has become}} significant {{in view of}} the realization that water has become scarce and it is becoming a critical problem globally. In big cities large residencies are required to have a rainwater harvesting system. For the present, drains are being constructed with conventional materials such as brick and stonemasonry and R.C.C. side drains. Rain water is made to flow through these drains to a centralized water storage tank. Water from this tank is designated for nondomestic and gardening purposes. The water storage tank is of brick masonry or R.C.C. The drains for the flow of rainwater and the tank for the storage of rainwater can be constructed using Ferrocement technology. Ferrocement drains are machine-made, precast products about 2.4 to 5 meters long with covers and perforations of the same length at about 25 mm thick. The surfaces of these drains are known to be strong and not easily eroded by the flow of water. The bottom and sides of the water storage tanks consist of ferrocement plates with space frames. These plates are about 25 mm <b>thick,</b> <b>waterproof,</b> strong, durable, and low-maintenance.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a <b>thick,</b> <b>waterproof</b> covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the breeding system, pollination experiments {{were performed on}} randomly chosen from 10 trees in the population. On each plant, 4 to 10 inflorescences (depending on availability on each plant) were randomly tagged and {{only one of the}} treatments assigned to each inflorescence (i.e. to every single flower on that inflorescence). Inflorescences (n[*]=[*] 6 for each treatment) subjected to hand-pollination were bagged with <b>thick</b> <b>waterproof</b> paper bags before anthesis and bagged again after hand-pollination. The pollination bags were partly opened 5  days after each treatment to monitor fruit set. When required, the flowers were emasculated on the day of anthesis, before the anthers dehisced. The following treatments were conducted (Saunders and Sedonia, 2006): (1) Control: the flowers were tagged and left to open pollination; (2) Geitonogamy: emasculated and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from the same plant but from another flower (to test for self-compatibility); (3) Xenogamy: emasculated and bagged flowers were hand-pollinated using pollen from different plants (to test for outcrossing ability); (4) Cross-pollination under natural conditions: uncovered and emasculated flowers were pollinated freely (to test for pollen limitation); (5) Autogamy: flower buds were bagged and isolated from visitors (to test for autonomous self-pollination within a single flower); (6) Apomixis: flowers were bagged and emasculated before anthesis (to test for the agamospermy).|$|R

40|$|Tijekom lipnja 2012. nastavljena su istraživanja na rimskoj vili smještenoj u uvali Soline otoka Sveti Klement zapadno od grada Hvara (otoka Hvara). Tri sonde istražene su do živca, a izvršeno je i kraće podmorsko rekognosciranje plitke uvale uz lokalitet, uz mjerenje pregradnih zidova solane te šireg dijela uvale Soline. In June of 2012, the {{investigations}} of the Roman villa located in Soline Bay {{on the island of}} St. Clement (Sv. Klement near Hvar) continued in their six season. Researchers from four institutions (Hvar Heritage Museum, Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb, University of St. Thomas, Minneapolis, Institute of Archaeology at the University of Graz) collaborated on the project, with a number of student and volunteer participants. Three probes on parcel 4319 were excavated to the bedrock: 7, 8 and 10. Probe 7 was an expansion of Probe 6 from 2011, where stratigraphic units 700 - 731 were documented. The wall (SU 717) of E-W direction, presumed in the magnetometric survey from 2010 was now archaeologically documented, along with its original floor (SU 719, 721), both of which are connected with the Late Roman villa. Another mortar floor with two foundations in chipped stones (SU 712, 713, 715) was documented above, testifying to a later reconstruction of the villa, of a so far undetermined date. Probe 8 was an expansion of Probe 4 from 2011, where stratigraphic units 800 - 825 were documented. The continuation of the N-S wall (SU 812) was documented in its foundations, that with the partially recovered parallel wall {{on the west side of}} the trench (SU 819) enclosed the Late Roman room within the villa. The continuation (from trench 4 excavated in 2011) of the <b>thick</b> Roman <b>waterproof</b> mortar floor (SU 817) abutting the wall foundation (SU 818) was documented in its overall dimensions. On the south side of the trench SU 815 and SU 816, there are probably the remains of a small grave. Archaeological evidence for the earlier Roman walls, indicated by the magnetometry results were not documented. The area of Novak‘s trench from the 1950 s was carefully cleaned, and two small probes were opened on the N (9) and S (10) edges of it. Probe 9 yielded architectural remains continuing in the S, E, and W direction. A bronze Roman coin was documented within the remains of the wall. Probe 10 documented stratigraphic units from 1000 - 1006. A floor (SU 1001), made of ceramic tiles dim. 35 x 35 cm, on the mortar foundation (SU 1002), and a thin burned layer was documented. The Soline bay was subjected to the underwater survey for the purpose of beginning the documentation and protection of the underwater architectural and material findings...|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Ciğlek DeresiLocal Information: The bridge, conduit, and tunnel {{are located}} on a small gully {{branching}} off {{the east side of}} the Ciğlek Deresi, a dry dere that runs north–south and connects to the Kepiz Çayı to the south. The Ciğlek Deresi forms the western limit of the Yahşiler plateau. The remains are located 4 km southwest of the modern village of Yahşiler, 2 km southeast of the modern village of Yeşilköy, and 16 km southeast of Aphrodisias. Latitude: 37. 36. 32. 024 Longitude: 28. 51. 40. 591 Elevation: 851. 3 mDescription: Preservation: The bridge that crossed the small gully north of the conduit no longer stands (E 034), but a cross section of the foundation, floor, and lower portion of the side walls of the conduit itself is preserved in the south hillside of the gully (E 035). The entire conduit is preserved inside the subterranean tunnel for 22 m, at which point the vault has collapsed. A short segment of conduit is preserved after this collapse, but a second collapse seals it off completely. ** Construction: Nothing can be said about the construction of the bridge that no longer stands (though see the projected original dimensions below). The conduit is a vaulted masonry structure built of regular blocks of the local sandy conglomerate rock, bonded with pink-beige lime mortar with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The blocks are 0. 10 – 0. 40 m long, 0. 16 – 0. 20 m high, and ** 0. 15 – 0. 20 deep. Mortared rubble packing supports the exterior of the side walls and vault. The conduit floor also rests on a foundation of mortared rubble of smaller stones that is 0. 30 – 0. 35 m thick. The foundation is topped by a bedding of white-gray lime mortar ** with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The mortar bedding is 0. 25 m thick under the center of the conduit floor but tapers to a thickness of 0. 10 m about 0. 20 – 0. 35 m from both edges of the floor. On top of this bedding is a very thin layer, 0. 001 m <b>thick,</b> of pink <b>waterproofing</b> mortar. On top of the pink waterproofing mortar is a layer of sinter, 0. 05 m thick. ** Description: The bridge must have originally been 5. 5 m high, 3. 8 m wide, and 8. 0 m long. The interior of the conduit is 1. 50 m wide and has a reconstructed height of 2. 25 m. Where the side walls are visible, they are 1. 15 m wide (east) and 1. 18 m wide (west). The portion of the conduit that has collapsed is 6. 7 m long. The preserved conduit within the hillside, which includes a 125 ° bend, can be divided into three segments according to differences in masonry. The first segment (as one enters the conduit from the north) is 8 m long on the outer side wall (west) of the bend and 7 m long on the inner (east) side wall, which is executed more sharply than the gently curving outer side wall. In this segment the vault is built of rubble masonry bonded with beige-pink lime mortar with small, loosely packed stone inclusions. A seam separates the rubble-vault segment from the next segment, which is 8. 8 m long and has a vault built of the same regular blocks as the side walls. The third segment has a vault of regular blocks, a portion of which has been rebuilt in rubble masonry with white-blue lime mortar with large, densely packed stone inclusions, most between 0. 005 m and 0. 012 m. The stones of the rebuilt portion are placed lengthwise across the width of the conduit and have a level profile, making it not a true vault at all. The putlog holes of the conduit are located at different heights within the three segments. They {{are located on}}e course lower in the regular-vault segment than in the other two segments. The putlog holes of the rubble-vault segment are set at intervals ranging from 0. 35 m to 1. 40 m in no clear pattern and are matched only roughly in pairs across the conduit. The putlog holes are set at shorter intervals at the inner part of the conduit curve. In the regular-vault segment, the putlog holes are set at intervals ranging between 0. 40 m and 2. 90 m, and are not matched across the conduit due to the bend. In the "false"-vault segment, the putlog holes are matched in pairs across the conduit, but those on the northeast side wall are located about 0. 14 m below those on the opposite side wall...|$|R
