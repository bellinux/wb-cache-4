40|$|AbstractThis {{position}} paper proposes a definition and naming standard for removable partial dentures (RPDs) using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin,</b> and presents a guideline for clinical application. A panel of 14 experts having broad experience with clinical application of RPDs using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> was selected {{from members of}} the Japan Prosthodontic Society. At a meeting of the panel, “non-metal clasp denture” was referred as the generic name of RPDs with retentive elements (resin clasps) made of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin.</b> The panel classified non-metal clasp dentures into two types: one with a flexible structure that lacks a metal framework and the other having a rigid structure that includes a metal framework. According to current prosthetic principles, flexible non-metal clasp dentures are not recommended as definitive dentures, except for limited cases such as patients with a metal allergy. Rigid non-metal clasp dentures are recommended in cases where patients will not accept metal clasps for esthetic reasons. Non-metal clasp dentures should follow the same design principles as conventional RPDs using metal clasps...|$|R

Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTP), which are superior in specific strength and specific modulus, {{is expected to be}} used for car body.

Although rapid heating process of mold has been developed by applying high-frequency direct resistance heating to the mold itself in previous studies, sufficient mechanical properties of CFRTP pipe could not be obtained because of the high viscosity of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin.</b> In CFRTP molding, impregnation improvement of the resin is one of the important issues to be solved.
