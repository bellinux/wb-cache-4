5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> Cortina from its European arm Ford of Europe as a captive import. American automakers would soon introduce their own subcompacts.|$|E

5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked them up in <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming {{that there was a}} bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine.

5|$|Before one combat a {{beautiful}} young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the Morrígan, and in revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms while he is engaged in combat against Lóch mac Mofemis. As an eel, she trips him in <b>the</b> <b>ford,</b> but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across <b>the</b> <b>ford,</b> but he blinds her eye with a sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer {{at the head of the}} stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone. After Cú Chulainn finally defeats Lóch, the Morrígan appears to him as an old woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there had}} never really been peace, the War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed <b>the</b> <b>Fords</b> of Isen.

On 23 February TA 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard however, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an island in <b>the</b> <b>fords,</b> but they were soon surrounded and he was killed. Grimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if Elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the first battle of <b>the</b> <b>Fords</b> of Isen ended in defeat for the Rohirrim.|$|R

5|$|Deep and fast-flowing, the el Auja river {{could not}} be crossed except at known and {{well-established}} places, so at 01:00 on 24 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment crossed at <b>the</b> <b>ford</b> on the beach. They moved at a gallop and quickly seized the hills which overlooked <b>the</b> <b>ford,</b> capturing the village of Sheikh Muannis (which gave its name to <b>the</b> <b>ford),</b> but the Ottoman cavalry garrison escaped. The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment {{came up to the}} Canterbury Regiment and then advanced eastwards to Khurbet Hadrah, which commanded the bridge on the main road. They captured 29 prisoners, one machine gun, and one British Lewis gun. Two infantry companies of the Essex Regiment, 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division crossed the Hadrah bridge and occupied the village. The 4th and 11th Squadrons of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment with the 2nd Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, were placed at the bridge and in the village of Sheikh Muannis in front of the infantry posts. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment's 1st Squadron took up a post on the sea beach; each of these squadrons had two machine guns to strengthen them.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace the route of <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing.

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of <b>the</b> <b>Ford</b> Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax breaks and other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E

5|$|The Bow Back Rivers cross an area {{originally}} {{known as}} Stratford Marsh, {{an area of}} common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay {{for the rest of}} the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end of a stone causeway across the marsh. Remains of a stone causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. <b>The</b> <b>ford</b> at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to <b>the</b> <b>ford,</b> which carried the principal road to Colchester.
