5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pay-per-view}} began, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) faced Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski. The Dudleyz initially {{dominated the}} match and executed the Wassup? on Nowinski. During the match, Theodore Long, Mack and Nowinski's manager, verbally distracted D-Von, resulting in D-Von punching Long and distracting the referee. Nowinski hit Bubba {{with a face}} mask <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore.</b> After the referee placed {{his attention to the}} match, Nowiniski pinned Bubba for the win.|$|E

5|$|Even before {{retiring}} from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931, he {{took part in a}} commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier. The commission laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931, he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lieutenant John Wehle. Her wedding was the only time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued {{to own a}} smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E
5|$|On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for {{the first}} time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to {{activate}} Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was ready to play.|$|E
25|$|Another urban legend {{states that}} a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth.

25|$|He {{was also}} famous for wearing {{many layers of}} tzitzit. At first, he wore about 150 pairs, but later, due to his fragile health, he wore only about 70 pairs. He had said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> them on behalf {{of people who do}} not fulfill this mitzvah, but Wittow {{believed}} that was not the main reason.|$|E
25|$|Julius Caesar {{is known}} to have worn a toupée. In dismay at his pattern baldness, he tried both wearing a toupée, and shaving his head.

Roman men of the era were also known to paint their bald heads to appear to have locks of hair.|$|E
25|$|Bell (2017) has {{the flag}} of Spain {{surrounding}} the helmet and shades of blue which are adapted from Asturias flags. This design is an original design helmet from when Alonso joined Minardi in the 2001 season, with the difference <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a blue color with dark blue shades, and then gradually changed to light blue and finally blue typical Asturias in 2004.|$|E

25|$|McVitie married Marie Marney in Surrey in 1950. He fathered one son who {{was named}} Tony Mcvitie. The {{nickname}} Jack the Hat {{is said to be}} because of a trilby hat <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> to cover up his hair loss. A known drug trafficker by the 1960s, he had been an associate of the Kray twins for some time and, although never a permanent member of The Firm, was regularly employed to commit various crimes on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial anorak {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E

25|$|Charlton Heston played More {{in several}} {{versions}} of the play-off-Broadway in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it on the West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favourite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a wig over his hairpiece, rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.|$|E
25|$|Baden-Powell {{returned}} to Africa in 1896, {{and served in}} the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo. This was a formative experience for him not only because he commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e. scoutcraft), and here <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>wore</b> a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E
