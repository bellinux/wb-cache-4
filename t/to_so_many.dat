25|$|The {{wide range}} of {{possibilities}} (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting high modernism, or {{as a symbol of}} it, appearing during times of aesthetic and sociopolitical upheavals.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-first century Secular Franciscans {{live out}} the secular {{aspect of their}} charism by paying {{attention}} to three things.

Secondly, {{at the beginning of the}} third millennium, they face a test of their creativity when confronted by the new evangelisation. Thirdly, they cultivate a deep knowledge of Francis the prophet, an example from the past, leading them into the future.|$|E

We could never hope to keep them informed and connected {{were it not for}} the kind of efforts you've made, and the professionalism and creativity that you've demonstrated”.

25|$|In 1857 {{at the age}} of 18 Busch emigrated {{with three}} of his older {{brothers}} to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he had so many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.|$|E
25|$|South of Black Fell is Tarn Hows, {{a picturesque}} work of {{landscape}} design initiated by James Marshall in the 1860s. This {{is one of}} the most popular destinations in the Lake District, the mixture of water, rock and arboretum being finely contrived. Now owned by the National Trust, the motor traffic is so great that a one-way system had to be initiated as early as the 1960s. Tarn Hows is maintained by a dam at the south west corner and circumnavigated by a broad, level path, providing access to all. Few of the millions of visitors stray onto the slopes of Black Fell, or even know the name of the hill which provides the backdrop <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> photographs.|$|E

25|$|Tōhoku Electric Power was {{not able}} to provide the Kanto region with {{additional}} power, because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco) cannot share electricity, because its system operates at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; this is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national power grid. Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and Tōhoku, but their capacity to do so is limited to 1 GW. With the damage <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> power plants, it may be years before a long-term solution can be found.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{hierarchy}} of the family including the Milano brothers, captains Mike Rizzitello, Jimmy Caci, and Luigi Gelfuso {{along with many other}} mobsters were arrested on various charges in the late 1980s, due largely to information and recordings collected by the Fiato brothers. These charges <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> members permanently crippled the family and put the family on the brink of extinction. While Rizzitello, who was acquitted of his original charges at trial, was sentenced to 33 years in prison in 1989 for attempted murder (where he would die in 2005) the Milano brothers plead guilty to lesser charges; Peter received a six-year prison sentence and Carmen received six months. Almost every member of the family charged pleaded guilty to receive lesser sentences and the F.B.I. considered the Mafia finished in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Originally, perhaps, each town {{clustered}} {{round one}} temple, and each head of {{family had a}} right to minister there and share its receipts. As the city grew, the right <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> days a year at one shrine (or its gate) descended within certain families and became a kind of property that could be pledged, rented or shared within the family, but not alienated. Despite all these demands, the temples became great granaries and storehouses and were also the city archives. The temple had its responsibilities. If a citizen was captured by the enemy and could not ransom himself, the temple of his city must do so. To the temple came the poor farmer to borrow seed, grain, or supplies for harvesters, etc.—advances that he repaid without interest.|$|E

25|$|The grape was {{historically}} a major planting in Bordeaux, providing {{color and}} fruit to the blend, {{but in the}} 20th century started to lose ground to Merlot and Cabernet Franc due, in part, to its sensitivities <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> different vine ailments (coulure, downy mildew, frost). The severe 1956 frost wiped out {{a significant portion of}} Malbec vines in Bordeaux, allowing many growers a chance to start anew with different varieties. By 1968 plantings in the Libournais was down to 12,100 acres (4,900 hectares) and fell further to 3,460 acres (1,400 hectares) by 2000. While Malbec has since become a popular component of New World meritages or Bordeaux blends, and it is still a permitted variety in all major wine regions of Bordeaux, its presence in Bordeaux is as a distinctly minor variety. Only the regions of the Côtes-de-Bourg, Blaye and Entre-Deux-Mers have any significant plantings in Bordeaux.|$|E
25|$|Among many {{memorial}} concerts nationwide, {{a memorial}} performance of The Dream of Gerontius was {{given at the}} Royal Albert Hall, at which John Coates and Frederick Ranalow sang with the Royal Choral Society. The Musicians' Benevolent Fund was first established as the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund for Musicians, and his figure became a presiding genius of twentieth-century English music. His particular association with the lyrics of A. E. Housman and the music of Elgar, and his death soon after the First World War, reinforce his embodiment of the lost Edwardian generation, perhaps the last in which his religious conviction could so thoroughly have endeared him <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many.</b> At much {{the same time the}} Glasgow Orpheus Choir instituted a Gervase Elwes Silver Medal, and the Feis Ceoil in Dublin inaugurated its Gervase Elwes Memorial Cup. A choir named after him was established at Walsall. A portrait plaque by Arthur Vokes was set up in the centre of the village of Billing.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 19th century Brympton d'Evercy was {{the home}} of Lady Georgiana Fane, a single lady of modest means who had no need of a large and lavish household. Thus the house was not given the Victorian wings given so {{carelessly}} <b>to</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of Britain's historic houses. Lady Georgiana confined herself to improvements in the gardens and grounds. She added a balustrade to the walls enclosing the forecourt {{in front of the}} west facade; the walls, topped by balustrading, link the priest house, churchyard on the south side, and clock-tower and stables on the north. The effect was to create what in a grander house than Brympton d'Evercy would be known as a cour d'honneur. Entered through great gate piers crowned by urns (see illustration top of page) the cour d'honneur effect is softened, and de-formalised by lawns and some very English style flower beds. The broad gravel terrace along {{the full extent of the}} south front was also created at this time, along with the large pond which reflects it. Other than necessary restoration work, and installation of modern plumbing and electricity, little has been added to the house since the 19th century. It is now recognised by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E

The term 'herpes simplex' appeared in Richard Boulton's A System of Rational and Practical Chirurgery in 1713, where the terms 'herpes miliaris' and 'herpes exedens' also appeared. Herpes was not found to be a virus until the 1940s.|$|E
