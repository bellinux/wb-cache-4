In 1948, his proposal to create a centralized board that governed all Kentucky colleges failed in the General Assembly. In both the 1948 and 1950 legislative sessions, Clements failed to convince the General Assembly to regulate strip mining. He also failed in his attempts to establish statewide pension and civil service programs, and was unable <b>to</b> <b>enact</b> a merit system for state employees. Attempts to fund a veterans' bonus passed the two houses of the General Assembly in different forms and were unable to be reconciled.|$|E

5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress <b>to</b> <b>enact</b> the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress <b>to</b> <b>enact</b> any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor.
