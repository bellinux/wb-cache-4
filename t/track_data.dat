25|$|Early on September 24, JTWC {{upgraded}} {{the system}} to a tropical storm; however, according to RSMC Best <b>Track</b> <b>Data,</b> the system intensified into a tropical depression at the same time. At noon, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical storm and named it Jangmi, when it was tracking northwestward under the steering influence of the subtropical ridge in the northeast. Several hours later, Jangmi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, earning the name Ofel from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).|$|E
25|$|Shortly after JMA {{upgraded}} Jangmi to {{a severe}} tropical storm early on September 25, JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon for its developing eye; moreover, according to RSMC Best <b>Track</b> <b>Data,</b> Jangmi intensified into a typhoon simultaneously. Tracking toward a {{weakness in the}} subtropical ridge induced by a mid-latitude trough to the north-northeast on September 26, Jangmi formed an cirrus-filled and ambiguous eye, as the typhoon gradually intensified owing to strong radial outflow provided by a mesoscale anticyclone aloft, which persisted into a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the east.|$|E
40|$|TDRS- 1 was {{launched}} on April 4, 1983. This paper presents preliminary results of TDRSS <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> evaluation through September 1983. TDRSS <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> evaluation is {{a summary of}} valid <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> that characterizes data quality. TDRS- 1 orbit accuracy is evaluated by using orbit consistency measured by comparing overlaps of TDRS- 1 ephemerides produced from consecutive data arcs. TDRS- 1 and user orbit accuracies and consistencies are also estimated. Orbit accuracy is estimated by comparing user orbits based on <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> obtained both through the TDRSS and from ground-based tracking...|$|R
40|$|It {{is obvious}} that the <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> {{acquired}} from each learning environment has become more advantageous to various participants in the learning process. As an example, the <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> of learner’s activities are used to depict not only the activities themselves but also the outputs of the activities that learners carried through. <b>Tracking</b> <b>data</b> are somehow considered useful elements, exploited by researchers and developers to improve learning environments as well as to develop other educational tools and applications. As yet, their riches and complexities have brought up a number of new research challenges, among which the use of the <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> for assisting the participants in the learning process, both learners and instructors. In this paper, we present an approach for better collecting and exploiting the <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> of the learner’s activities while interacting with Computer Mediated Communication tools in Web-based learning environments...|$|R

25|$|If Storm 91C is {{considered}} a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it holds several records. Since the storm is not official, its holding of these records is unofficial. Since it formed at 36°N, this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32°N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's <b>track</b> <b>data</b> indicates that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149°W and dissipated at 135°W. Only two recorded other tropical cyclones had done that previously.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after {{slightly}} weakening due to land interaction, Gafilo made landfall in {{the vicinity}} of Antalaha, Madagascar early on 7 March. Unlike other storms, the overland depression just weakened gradually, because of its unusually large circulation making the outer part still at sea. On that day, Gafilo tracked more southwestwards along the northwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the southeast. Before noon on 8 March, Gafilo arrived at the Mozambique Channel as a moderate tropical storm whose strongest winds were located in the northern sector. On 9 March, Gafilo became almost stationary and then tracked southeastwards along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge located to the east. MFR upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm supported by observed data from Malagasy stations at noon; however, JTWC analysed that the storm became below category 1 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale {{at the same time in}} their best <b>track</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceTracks {{of marine}} {{animals in the}} wild, now {{increasingly}} acquired by electronic tagging of individuals, are of prime interest not only to identify habitats and high-risk areas, but also to gain detailed information about the behaviour of these animals. Using recent satellite-derived current estimates and leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) <b>tracking</b> <b>data,</b> we demonstrate that oceanic currents, usually neglected when analysing <b>tracking</b> <b>data,</b> can substantially distort the observed trajectories. Consequently, this will affect several important results deduced from the analysis of <b>tracking</b> <b>data,</b> such as {{the evaluation of the}} orientation skills and the energy budget of animals or the identification of foraging areas.

25|$|During the Early Oligocene, {{the region}} of the Eastern Hills and the Bogotá savanna was exhumed, while {{sedimentation}} in the Llanos Orientales continued, depositing the Carbonera Formation in a lacustrine-marine setting. By the Late Oligocene, the Eastern Ranges were in a continental environment and deposition shifted towards the Llanos. The northern part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense experienced exhumation around 26 Ma, while the southern part was exhumed approximately 21 million years ago. In Early to Middle Miocene times, the Eastern and Western Cordilleras enclosed a fluvial depositional environment in the Magdalena Basin. During this epoch in the tectonic history, maximum foreland sedimentation to the east (Medina area) was reached, and a rich fossil fauna was present to the southeast of the Eastern Hills area, in the present-day Tatacoa Desert of Huila. The Konservat-Lagerstätte of the Honda Group at La Venta {{is one of the most}} important Neogene paleontological sites of South America, especially in the diversity of mammals found. The fossil community from La Venta, Colombia, demonstrates a degree of phylogenetic richness (i.e., number of taxa) comparable with modern communities. The Late Miocene marked the formation of the continuous chain of the Eastern Andes, leading to erosion of earlier deposited sediments. Based on zircon and apatite fission <b>track</b> <b>data,</b> the uplift between the Early Miocene to Pliocene was slow, subsequently followed by a period of increased tectonic uplift in the last phases of the Andean orogeny.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{disputes}} between the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the best <b>track</b> <b>data,</b> and the post-season report concerning the hurricane. The first involved the peak {{intensity of the}} hurricane. The post-season report released by the Environmental Science Services Administration noted that the [...] winds recorded by the unknown ship on September 1 were received two days after cool inflow, and gave the hurricane a peak intensity estimate of [...] on August 30, making Liza a Category3 hurricane and the most intense hurricane of the season. However, the JTWC and the best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> both gave peak intensities equivalent to the ship report on September 1. Liza {{was the first of}} three hurricanes of the season that was thought to have reached Category3 strength. The other two were Pauline and Rebecca.|$|E
500|$|The Intertropical Convergence Zone {{disturbance}} {{that developed}} into Hurricane Pauline was first noticed by meteorologists [...] southeast of Acapulco and - west of dissipating Tropical Storm Orla. The disturbance {{was in a}} large area of convection west of Guatemala in the Gulf of Tehuantepec that began to spread [...] to the west-northwest on September26. Satellite imagery at this time showed an area of reflective clouds roughly [...] long and [...] wide. Shortly thereafter, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. After being upgraded, a vortex began to organize at its center and the depression began to intensify. On September 29, a ship [...] south of the center reported winds of [...] to [...] and a minimum pressure of 1008mbar, the only pressure reading left on best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> for the entire season. Other than this ship, all other active boats steered away {{from the center of}} the developing system. Later that day, it was determined that the depression had reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present results {{assessing}} {{the role of}} Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> through precision orbit determination (POD) during the check-out phase for Chang&# 39;E- 1, and the lunar gravity field solution CEGM- 01 based on the orbital <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> acquired during the nominal phase of the mission. The POD of Chang&# 39;E- 1 is performed using S-band two-way Range and Range Rate (R&RR) data, together with VLBI delay and delay rate observations. The role of the VLBI data in the POD of Chang&# 39;E- 1 is analyzed, and the resulting orbital accuracies are estimated for different solution strategies. The final orbital accuracies proved that the VLBI <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> can improve the Chang&# 39;E- 1 POD significantly. Consequently, CEGM- 01 based on six-month <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> during Chang&# 39;E- 1 nominal mission phase is presented, and {{the accuracy of the}} model is assessed by means of the gravity field power spectrum, admittance and coherence between gravity and topography, lunar surface gravity anomaly and POD for both Chang&# 39;E- 1 and Lunar Prospector (LP). Our analysis indicates that CEGM- 01 has significant improvements over a prior model (i. e. GLGM- 2), and shows the potential of Chang&# 39;E- 1 <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> in high resolution lunar gravity field model solution by combining with SELENE and LP <b>tracking</b> <b>data.</b> (C) 2010 COSPAR.

500|$|Forecasts {{initially}} projected the cyclone recurving southeastward late on 30January before tracing southwestward {{during the}} evening of 31January. Maintaining a relatively large eye with a width of about , the cyclone intensified while nearing the shoreline of northern Queensland; by 0300UTC the following day, though, a slight reduction in its size was noticeable, {{and by the time}} the cyclone made landfall, its eye was merely [...] in diameter. In conjunction, the storm's minimum atmospheric pressure sank to 957mbar (28.38inHg) by the time the cyclone made landfall near Silkwood at 0445UTC, indicative of the storm's peak intensity; the low pressure, coinciding with 10-minutemaximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph), placed Winifred as a Category2-equivalent storm on the Saffir–Simpson scale, or a Category3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. Drifting father inland, Winifred's radar features became distorted as it weakened; despite this, it lingered overland as a tropical depression for another five days before finally dissipating. Although official best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> recorded the storm dissipated on 5February, Winifred was operationally declared dissipated on 6February. The cyclone was the first in 14years to significantly impact the northeastern coast of Australia.|$|E

40|$|This paper revisits visual {{saliency}} prediction by {{evaluating the}} recent advancements {{in this field}} such as crowd-sourced mouse tracking-based databases and contextual annotations. We pursue a critical and quantitative approach towards {{some of the new}} challenges including the quality of mouse tracking versus eye tracking for model training and evaluation. We extend quantitative evaluation of models in order to incorporate contextual information by proposing an evaluation methodology that allows accounting for contextual factors such as text, faces, and object attributes. The proposed contextual evaluation scheme facilitates detailed analysis of models and helps identify their pros and cons. Through several experiments, we find that (1) mouse <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> has lower inter-participant visual congruency and higher dispersion, compared to the eye <b>tracking</b> <b>data,</b> (2) mouse <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> does not totally agree with eye tracking in general and in terms of different contextual regions in specific, and (3) mouse <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> leads to acceptable results in training current existing models, and (4) mouse <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> is less reliable for model selection and evaluation.
