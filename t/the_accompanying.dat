5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
