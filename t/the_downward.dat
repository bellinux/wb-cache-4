5|$|Early {{ideas for}} <b>The</b> <b>Downward</b> Spiral were {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later {{used it as}} lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and <b>The</b> <b>Downward</b> Spiral. This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E

5|$|Reznor has toured {{with some}} of his influences, {{including}} a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1989. In 1995 Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who along with Pink Floyd had been a significant influence on <b>The</b> <b>Downward</b> Spiral.|$|E
5|$|Unbinilium {{should be}} a solid at room temperature, with melting point 680°C: this {{continues}} <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> trend down the group, being lower than the value 700°C for radium. The boiling point of ununennium {{is expected to be}} around 1700°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group (in particular, radium boils at 1737°C), following <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been predicted to be 7g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group: the value for radium is 5.5g·cm−3.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 1990s <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> trend was {{starting}} to reverse: at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums {{in the aftermath of the}} Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
30|$|So, by {{dynamics}} calculation, {{when the}} car body passes through the finger-shaped plate area, the tire force operation is as follows: the vertical acceleration of <b>the</b> tire (<b>downward)</b> is increased from 0 to 10  m/s 2 in the first 0.0061  s, and the vertical acceleration of <b>the</b> tire (<b>downward)</b> is reduced from 10 to 0  m/s 2 in the following 0.0061  s.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. <b>The</b> <b>downward</b> slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>downward</b> {{spiral of}} {{the economy has been}} {{attributed}} mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and the docks moved into storage and freight. <b>The</b> <b>downward</b> shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on the docks continued: as the docks themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. <b>The</b> <b>downward</b> flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E

5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. <b>The</b> <b>downward</b> firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: <b>The</b> <b>Downward</b> Spiral, follow-up The Fragile, and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{budget cuts}} by Gateshead Council {{have seen the}} local {{authority}} transfer {{the management of the}} park to the community, despite a local petition raised in protest. The reserve remains popular with residents; in May 2012 dozens of volunteers cleared rubbish and engaged in a 'Windy Nook Wildlife Festival' with face-painting and other traditional activities. Local police continue to make 'targeted patrols' of the reserve to maintain <b>the</b> <b>downward</b> trend of anti-social behaviour in the area. In November 2012 a 'green gym' was opened at the reserve. This saw fitness equipment installed in clusters of three and four machines which is available for use by the public free of charge. This is one of only two such outdoor public gyms in Gateshead, the other being opened simultaneously at Saltwell Park.|$|E
