To {{reflect the}} {{significantly}} increased population in the area, Romford Rural District was abolished in 1934 and Cranham was amalgamated with neighbouring parishes into Hornchurch Urban District. The parish council was abolished and Hornchurch Urban District Council became the local authority. There was a revision of boundaries with North Ockendon, which {{had been part of}} Orsett Rural District, absorbed into Cranham and a small area to the north, near Great Warley, transferred to Brentwood Urban District.|$|E

There is a choice of nearby senior schools for older Navenby pupils, although none are within the village. Lincolnshire County Council operates a preference system for parents, which allows them to choose a preferred school, rather than one {{for which they are}} in the catchment area. The closest senior school to Navenby, and the one that is within the Designated <b>Transport</b> <b>Area,</b> is Sir William Robertson High School at Welbourn. This is a mixed comprehensive school named after Field Marshal William Robertson, who was born in Welbourn and served in the First World War.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 granted their request by establishing the London Traffic Area to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the Metropolitan Railway and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation which was {{to take control of the}} Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger <b>Transport</b> <b>Area</b> covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.|$|E
5|$|To {{protect the}} UERL group's income, its {{chairman}} Lord Ashfield lobbied {{the government for}} regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison {{at the forefront of}} debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger <b>Transport</b> <b>Area.</b> The Board was a compromise– public ownership but not full nationalisation– and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated.|$|E
25|$|The LPTB, under Lord Ashfield, assumed {{responsibility}} for all bus {{services in the}} London Passenger <b>Transport</b> <b>Area,</b> an area with a radius of about 30 miles of central London.

25|$|Late in August, she {{participated in}} {{tactical}} maneuvers and minesweeping {{exercises in the}} Russells preparing for the impending assault on the Palaus. Underway from Guadalcanal on 8 September, Tumult screened her task group on station until her arrival off Peleliu on D-Day, 15 September 1944. Early that morning, she began sweeps off Angaur Island and, during the days which followed, alternated minesweeping duties with patrolling and screening of the <b>transport</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|After repairs, she {{departed}} Manus on 10 October 1944 with {{a sweeping}} unit of task group TG 77.5 {{bound for the}} Philippines.

By 18March 1944, she was back in the Solomons, ready for her part in the series of westward-moving amphibious assaults that won New Guinea. Again, it was escort and {{bombardment}} repeatedly until 18October, when O'Bannon cleared Hollandia to escort reinforcements for the invasion of Leyte. The convoy was brought in safely on 24October, the eve of the Battle for Leyte Gulf. O'Bannon guarded the Northern <b>Transport</b> <b>area</b> and patrolled the entrances to Leyte Gulf during the battle, coming under air attack. Thus, she played her part in the definitive destruction of the Japanese Navy.|$|E

25|$|After the {{transports}} {{arrived at}} the <b>transport</b> <b>area</b> off Empress August Bay, at 07:10 hours on 1 November, the first wave disembarked from the transports and went ashore aboard {{a large number of}} LCVPs landing at 12 pre-designated beaches along an 8,000-yard front north of and including Cape Torokina, extending as far as Koromokina Lagoon. As the marines came ashore, a force of 31 US Marine aircraft, staging out of Munda, attacked Japanese positions on the landing beaches, while heavy, but ultimately ineffective naval gunfire was also brought down ahead of the assault. The 9th Marines assaulted the western beaches while the 3rd Marines took the eastern beaches and the cape itself. The 3rd Marine Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Fred D. Beans captured Puruata Island about 1,000 yards west of the cape against a well entrenched Japanese force. After being ejected from their pillboxes and trenches, the survivors escaped into the interior of the island; mopping up operations began on 2 November.|$|E
25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The <b>transport</b> <b>area</b> or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty power-operated davits. Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin davits – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier davits were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with luffing davits of a crossbeam type. The davits themselves provided a demarcation between the responsibilities of the LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA Flotilla.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{repairs to}} Selfridge {{were made at}} Purvis Bay and at Nouméa. Permanent repairs, {{including}} the installation of a new bow and a complete new gun armament, were made at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard; and, after refresher training out of San Diego, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 May 1944 in time to join the forces staging for {{the invasion of the}} Marianas Islands. Initially assigned to TG50.11, she joined TF58, the fast carrier force, at Majuro in early June; and, on the 11th, screened Bunker Hill as sweeps were conducted over Guam. On the 13th, she participated in a shore bombardment of Saipan to cover minesweeping operations off that target island; then shifted to night fire. On the 14th, she joined the fire support unit; and, on the 15th, screened the <b>transport</b> <b>area</b> as the assault troops landed on Saipan. From then to the 17th, she rotated between daytime screening activities and nighttime harassment duty. On the latter date, word of a Japanese force moving in from the Philippines reached the assault force, and Selfridge rejoined TF58 and took station as the linking vessel between TG's 58.7 and 58.3. On the 19th, the Battle of the Philippine Sea raged; but none of the enemy's aircraft came within range of Selfridge's guns. On the 20th and 21st, the Japanese proceeded westward. On the 24th, Selfridge rejoined the transport screen off Saipan; and, on the 26th, resumed fire support duties.|$|E
