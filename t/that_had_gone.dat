5|$|Georgia {{was again}} unable {{to earn a}} first down in the ensuing possession, and {{attempted}} three straight rushing plays that earned a total of sixyards. After a Georgia punt, Virginia Tech ran two rushing plays before attempting the same Royal pass <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> for a touchdown earlier. Georgia, having anticipated the play, sacked Royal for a loss of twoyards, ending the firsthalf.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 1914, he {{returned}} to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders.

5|$|In the post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center {{identified}} {{an additional}} subtropical storm <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed {{during the course}} of the season. The storm formed on October 4 and was absorbed by a non-tropical low the next day after passing over the Azores, where Santa Maria Island reported sustained winds up to 40mph (60km/h). The low that absorbed the storm would eventually become Hurricane Vince. At its peak, the storm had winds of 50mph (80km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997mbar (hPa). No damages or casualties were reported.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E

5|$|The most {{high-profile}} sprinters {{lined up}} to begin the 2007 Giro were Alessandro Petacchi and Robbie McEwen. They, along with countrymen Mario Cipollini and Baden Cooke, had had a back-and-forth rivalry for sprinting supremacy <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> back several years but had been stunted in 2006 when Petacchi missed most of the season, including all but the first three stages of the Giro, due to a fractured kneecap sustained from a crash. One pre-race analysis viewed Petacchi's 2007 Giro and season as a chance at redemption for him. Other fast men in the race noted to be contenders in the flat stages included two-time points classification winner Bettini, Danilo Napolitano, and Graeme Brown.|$|E
5|$|The German column from Kitanda reached Songea {{early in}} the morning on 12 November 1916, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} a frontal assault on the well-entrenched Rhodesian positions. After the German column from Likuyu arrived in the afternoon, the Germans laid siege to Songea for 12 days before retreating towards Likuyu on the 24th. The Rhodesians were relieved the following day by a South African unit. The RNR then moved back to Litruchi, {{on the other side of}} Lake Nyasa, from where they sailed to the German East African town of Mwaya, where they were reunited with the RNR contingent <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to Buhora. This second column had ambushed a group of Germans, who were moving towards Northern Rhodesia with a naval gun salvaged from SMS Königsberg (which had been sunk at Rufiji Delta about a year before); after pocketing the Germans, the Rhodesians captured both them and the naval gun.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E

5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Bizye heard of Thomas's fate, they surrendered Anastasius, who suffered the same fate as Thomas. In Panium and Heraclea, Thomas's men held out until an earthquake struck in February 824. The tremor severely damaged the wall of Panium, and the city surrendered. The damage at Heraclea was less severe, but after Michael landed troops at its seaward side, it too was forced to surrender. In Asia Minor, Thomas's loyalists mostly submitted peacefully, but in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, resistance lingered until suppressed by strategos John Echimos. In the Thracesian theme, Thomas's soldiers turned to brigandage. The most serious opposition was offered in central Asia Minor by two officers, who had possibly served Thomas as strategoi: Choireus, with his base at Kaballa northwest of Iconium, and Gazarenos Koloneiates, based at Saniana, southeast of Ancyra. From their strongholds, they spurned Michael's offer of a pardon and the high title of magistros and raided the provinces <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> over to him. Soon, however, Michael's agents persuaded {{the inhabitants}} of the two forts to shut their gates against the officers. Choireus and Koloneiates then tried to seek refuge in Arab territory but were attacked en route by loyalist troops, captured, and crucified.|$|E

Actually, Lloyd's List had already reported that Hyperion had gone on shore on Summers Island on 13 September, but that part of her cargo had been landed and that she was expected to be refloated.
