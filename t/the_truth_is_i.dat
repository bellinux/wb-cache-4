(Liam then sued Noel for lying on that matter and demanded an apology, stating [...] "I want Oasis fans, and others who were at V, to know the truth. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> had laryngitis, which Noel was made fully aware of that morning, diagnosed by a doctor." [...] Noel later issued an apology and the lawsuit was dropped.) Tension between the brothers rose and a fight between them in a backstage area on 28 August 2009 reportedly resulted in Liam throwing a plum and wielding Noel's guitar like an axe. The group's manager announced the cancellation of their concert at the Rock en Seine festival near Paris just minutes before {{it was about to}} begin, along with the cancellation of the last date at I-Day Festival and {{a statement}} that the group [...] "does not exist anymore". Two hours later, a statement from Noel appeared on the band's website: ...|$|E

500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E
500|$|A murderous and psychopathic {{criminal}} mastermind who portrays {{himself as}} an [...] "agent of chaos" [...] and rises to power by terrorizing Gotham and plunging it into anarchy. Before Ledger was confirmed for the role in July 2006, Paul Bettany, Lachy Hulme, Adrien Brody, Steve Carell, and Robin Williams publicly expressed interest in it. However, Nolan had {{wanted to work with}} Ledger on a number of projects in the past (including unsuccessfully approaching Ledger for the role of Batman in Batman Begins) and was agreeable to Ledger's chaotic interpretation of the character. When Ledger saw Batman Begins, he had realized a way to make the character work that was consistent with the film's tone: he described his Joker as a [...] "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." [...] In the film, the Joker has a Glasgow smile, and his trademark chalk-white skin and red lips are makeup rather than the result of chemical bleaching, as in the traditional portrayal of the character. Throughout the film, the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime, and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role, Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month, formulating the character's posture, voice, and personality, and kept a diary, in which he recorded the Joker's thoughts and feelings. While he initially found it difficult, Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholson's character in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. He was also given [...] and , which he [...] "really tried to read and put it down." [...] Ledger also cited A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious as [...] "a very early starting point for Christian [...] and I. But we kind of flew far away from that pretty quickly and into another world altogether." [...] "There's a bit of everything in him. There's nothing that consistent," [...] Ledger said, and added, [...] "There are a few more surprises to him." [...] Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter (Anthony Michael Hall). On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose, leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. [...] "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day ," [...] Nolan recalled. [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." [...] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no [...] "digital effects" [...] to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory.|$|E
