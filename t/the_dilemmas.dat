5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. <b>The</b> <b>dilemmas</b> are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>dilemmas</b> of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing {{within an hour of}} birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of <b>the</b> <b>dilemmas</b> of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
40|$|According to <b>the</b> doctrinal <b>dilemma,</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of military doctrines is challenging. Either the doctrines become too explicit and specific or they become too abstract for the target groups, {{both of which}} have negative consequences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine to what extent <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> exists and how it is taken into consideration in the doctrinal development process. In order to analyse <b>the</b> <b>dilemma,</b> two Swedish doctrines have been reviewed and their authors interviewed. Â  The results indicates that <b>the</b> doctrinal <b>dilemma</b> has had a central role in the doctrinal development process of both doctrines. The authors have handled <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> through constructing abstract rather than specific doctrines. The study also reveals that it is necessary that doctrines are consistently formulated and that the users are acquainted with the style of the doctrine. The dissertation contributes with an increased understanding of <b>the</b> <b>dilemma,</b> facilitating <b>the</b> {{construction of}} doctrines and enabling that they can serve as force multipliers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone (DZ) have been realized since {{the concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone was proposed in 1960. The dynamics are {{a reflection of the}} dynamical characteristics of the driver-vehicle complex, and can be characterized by the dynamical features of <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone contributing factors which include the minimum perception-reaction time (PRT) and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates. To date, the {{dynamics of}} these contributing factors have not yet been well modeled and quantified despite being continuously explored by researchers over decades. In the absence of the quantitative knowledge about these contributing factors, <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone with assumed constant parameter values, and <b>the</b> Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone defined from a probabilistic perspective (i. e. a zone in which at the onset of yellow interval more than 10 % and less than 90 % drivers would choose to stop) were widely used in practice as alternatives in estimating <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone. However, both alternatives are compromised in ways, being still incapable of reflecting <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics. In fact, the incapacity of modeling and quantifying <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics was {{due to the lack of}} reliable and robust vehicular trajectory data during the yellow intervals. The availability of video-capture based software VEVID enabled the collection of high-frequency time-based trajectory data from high-definition digital video and hence offered technical preparedness for modeling <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone dynamics. <b>The</b> most significant innovation of this paper lies in the proposal of <b>the</b> dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model by incorporating the quantitative dynamics into <b>the</b> traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model. <b>The</b> dynamical contributing factors were identified, quantified, and eventually formulated. Particularly, the models for the contributing factors were developed and validated using separate datasets. The validation results indicated that the models for the dynamical contributing factors are effective in predicting the minimum PRT and the maximum acceleration and deceleration rates under various speed conditions. Specifically, the minimum PRT is a function of individual vehicle's speed; and the maximum deceleration and acceleration rates are functions of both the individual vehicle's speed and the intersection approach's 85 th percentile speed. The final evaluation compared <b>the</b> dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone with <b>the</b> traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model, and <b>the</b> Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone model calibrated based on the same trajectory data used for developing <b>the</b> dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model. As expected, the evaluation results indicated that <b>the</b> dynamical <b>dilemma</b> zone model estimated <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> zone more accurately than <b>the</b> traditional <b>dilemma</b> zone model and <b>the</b> Type II <b>dilemma</b> zone model. This innovation brings advancement in empirical understanding and theoretical modeling of the dynamics of DZ and hence provides theoretical support for developing more efficient and effective dilemma zone protection strategies in the future...|$|R

The method of the study was qualitative and included a semi-structured transcript interview which was recorded on a tape collected from a psychiatric nurse K. The result shows <b>the</b> nurse's <b>dilemma</b> was created by his moral sense, characterized by the contradiction between his sense of values and the realities of nursing care. The categories of <b>the</b> nurse's <b>dilemma</b> were about judgment about the necessity of the restraint, and interpersonal relationship with his colleagues.

500|$|When Oppenheimer was {{ejected from}} his {{position}} of political influence in 1954, he symbolized for many the folly of scientists thinking they could control how others would use their research. He has also been seen as symbolizing <b>the</b> <b>dilemmas</b> involving the moral responsibility of the scientist in the nuclear world. The hearings were motivated both by politics, as Oppenheimer {{was seen as a}} representative of the previous administration, and by personal considerations stemming from his enmity with Lewis Strauss. The ostensible reason for the hearing and the issue that aligned Oppenheimer with the liberal intellectuals, Oppenheimer's opposition to hydrogen bomb development, was based as much on technical grounds as on moral ones. Once the technical considerations were resolved, he supported Teller's hydrogen bomb because he believed that the Soviet Union would inevitably construct one too. Rather than consistently oppose the [...] "Red-baiting" [...] of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against some of his former colleagues and students, both before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end it became a liability when it became clear that if Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters' loyalty, his recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Daniel Defoe's Roxana. Through the {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> main character's <b>dilemma,</b> <b>the</b> writer is curious to know how Roxana overcomes her <b>dilemma</b> and <b>the</b> consequence of her decision on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma.</b> <b>The</b> writer is also curious to know how <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> and <b>the</b> consequence of her decision on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> lead Roxana to self-realization. The writer intends {{to find out the}} ways Roxana overcomes her <b>dilemma</b> and <b>the</b> ways Roxana overcomes the consequence of her decision on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma.</b> Besides, <b>the</b> writer intends to find out that Roxana's <b>dilemma</b> and <b>the</b> consequence of her decision on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> help her to reach selfrealization. In order to achieve the objective goal, the writer uses psychological theories and literary devices namely characterization and conflict. Then, through all of the discussion on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma,</b> <b>the</b> writer finds out that Roxana often faces <b>dilemma</b> between <b>the</b> worldly value and moral value. Besides, Roxana also faces <b>dilemma</b> between doing <b>the</b> right thing or doing the wrong thing. In this case, Roxana has to decide between being honest or dishonest. In order to overcome her dilemma, Roxana often uses rationalization and she always uses everything that gives her benefit. Since Roxana does not know herself well, Roxana always regrets her decision on <b>the</b> <b>dilemma</b> and feels guilty. In order to overcome her regret and guilty feeling, Roxana always deceives herself Furthermore, Roxana's changing heart after she takes decision on her dilemma supports Roxana to do self-analysis. From the discussion of Roxana's self-analysis, the writer sees that Roxana changes from having no understanding about herself till having awareness of her weakest part. The discussion also shows that Roxana's point of view about her way of life has changed. She considers that her way of life in the past is wrong so that she decides to take repentance. Her point of view about money also changes from thinking money {{is the most important thing}} to have opinion that money means nothing...|$|R
