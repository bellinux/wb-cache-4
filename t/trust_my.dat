500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
2500|$|K. J. Choi {{introduced}} Lee {{to another}} Australian, Steve Bann, {{as a potential}} coach. [...] "I am close with K.J. Choi and he said I was thinking too much about my swing," [...] Lee said. [...] "I was always working on something and I am too technical sometimes so K.J. introduced me to Steve. Steve is a simple guy who is teaching me how to practise with better routine and how to <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> own game and not think too much.|$|E
2500|$|Her father, however, was not {{impressed}} with her goal {{of becoming a}} photographer on her own. He wanted her to at least take some formal training with a professional photographer. [...] "Well, I never had the patience for that," [...] she said. [...] "I had to <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> feelings." [...] She did however study the photography of horses at college in Arizona under Hazel Larsen Archer, and became at that time an avid nature hobbyist, using a high quality Leica camera. A few months after her Rolling Stones shoot, she was allowed back stage at Shea Stadium where the Beatles performed.|$|E

2500|$|... {{the critics}} have no {{historical}} sense. I have no Cabinet papers {{by me and}} {{do not want to}} <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> memory. But recall the Fulham election, the peace ballot, Singapore, sanctions, Malta. The English will only learn by example. When I first heard of Hitler, when Ribbentrop came to see me, I thought they were all crazy. I think I brought Ramsay and Simon to meet Ribbentrop. Remember that Ramsay's health was breaking up in the last two years. He had lost his nerve in the House in the last year. I had to take all the important speeches. The moment he went, I prepared for a general election and got a bigger majority for rearmament. No power on earth could have got rearmament without a general election except by a big split. Simon was inefficient. I had to lead the House, keep the machine together with those Labour fellows.|$|E
2500|$|When Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci {{to persuade}} Liu Yao's {{followers}} to surrender, many of Sun Ce's aides felt that Taishi Ci {{could not be}} trusted. They believed that Taishi Ci would defect to either Hua Xin or Huang Zu. However, Sun Ce said, [...] "All of you are wrong. I <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> judgment. Taishi Ci may be brave and headstrong, {{but he is not}} an impulsive person. He is a man of exemplary character and a man who keeps his word. I treat him like a close friend and will not betray him. All of you don't need to worry." [...] Sun Ce's aides only trusted Taishi Ci after he kept his promise and returned from Yuzhang Commandery. When Taishi Ci met Sun Ce again, he said, [...] "Hua Ziyu is a man of virtue, but not a talented leader. He has no grand plan; he only wants to preserve the status quo. Tong Zhi (僮芝) from Danyang lied that he has been appointed as the Administrator of Luling and has taken control of the commandery. The local clans in Poyang have formed their own ruling body and driven away the officials sent by Hua Ziyu to govern the area. Hua Ziyu is unable to control Luling and Poyang. Moreover, about 5,000 to 6,000 local clans in Haihun (海昏) have formed their own ruling body too and rejected control by the commandery administration. Hua Ziyu can do nothing about this." [...] Sun Ce clapped his hands and laughed. Later on, he pacified Yuzhang Commandery and successfully induced Hua Xin to surrender to him.|$|E
60|$|If I could <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I {{should say}} I {{produced}} exactly the contrary effect on him--I made him melancholy. But I don't <b>trust</b> <b>my</b> eyes. They must be deceiving {{me when they}} tell me that he looked, in my company, a moping, anxious, miserable man.|$|E

5000|$|He <b>trusted</b> <b>my</b> instincts, {{which were}} {{that he should}} go after being a rock star, rather than a star on black American radio.
