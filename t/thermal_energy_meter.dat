40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} radio {{coverage}} of anchor nodes and reliability in an anchor-based {{wireless sensor network}} platform used in locating and monitoring smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> Knowledge of the location of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> is critical for network functionalities such as monitoring, billing and energy budget planning. One efficient technique of determining the location of field monitoring and measuring devices such as smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> is the anchor-based localization. Anchor-based localization is a technique in which the unknown node’s location is determined with reference to a location aware node. Anchor-based localization techniques require anchor nodes having good radio coverage to the unknown nodes. The error associated with localization is high when anchor nodes are not optimally accessed by unknown nodes in the network. This paper performed a radio coverage analysis and evaluated the reliability of anchor nodes within a network perimeter for the localization and monitoring of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> An outage probability was used to verify reliability of the network for the localization and monitoring of the smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters.</b> Our result show that for a 100 by 100 meter perimeter, four anchor nodes will provide good reliability of radio coverage for the localization and monitoring of smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters...</b>|$|R
