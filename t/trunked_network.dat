Finally, more powerful techniques are examined based on the implied cost method of Kelly. 1. DYNAMIC ALTERNATIVE ROUTING (DAR) DAR was developed for application to the UK <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> [1]. The development and motivation for it are described fully by Stacey and Songhurst [2]. The UK <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> comprises a top tier of 55 fully-interconnected Digital Main Switching Units (DMSUs), and a lower tier of local exchanges, each of which is connected to two DMSUs.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the interrelatedness between the hierarchical structure of China׳s urban system and high-speed railway (HSR) network planning {{at the national}} level. As a multi-layered system, the Chinese HSR can be categorized into three sub-networks, namely, the national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network,</b> the national HSR extensional network, and the intercity HSR network. By examining the direct HSR network connection, HSR nodal connection, and HSR operational frequency of 287 prefecture-level cities, this study demonstrates that the hierarchies of China׳s administrative, demographic, and economic urban systems strongly influence HSR network planning. The national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> prioritizes the connection of top-level central cities, whereas the extensional network prioritizes cities at the lower level of the urban system. Moreover, the national HSR system forms {{the backbone of the}} HSR network structure based on a national scale, whereas the intercity HSR system satisfies the travel needs within urban agglomerations based on the regional level...|$|R
