[...] Although wila is edible, {{most of the other}} species of Bryoria are mildly toxic and should not be eaten in large quantities. [...] Furthermore, in certain areas wila can contain toxic quantities of vulpinic acid, {{which is one of the}} most potent poisons found in lichens. [...] If you intend to eat wila, you must take proper care to ensure that you are collecting the right species, and that it is not a morphotype that is high in vulpinic acid.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} God created {{humanity}} {{from one person}} in [...] to teach that Providence considers one who destroys a single person as one who has destroyed an entire world, and Providence considers one who saves a single person as one who has saved an entire world. And God created humanity from one person {{for the sake of}} peace, so that none can say that their ancestry is greater than another's. And God created humanity from one person so that heretics cannot say that there are many gods who created several human souls. And God created humanity from one person to demonstrate God's greatness, for people stamp out many coins with one coin press and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>look</b> alike, but God stamped each person with the seal of Adam, and not one of them is like another. Therefore, every person is obliged to say, [...] "For my sake the world was created.".
