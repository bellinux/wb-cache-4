5000|$|The <b>technology,</b> <b>deployed</b> by Metricom Inc., {{worked as}} a {{wireless}} mesh network: packets were forwarded by small repeaters (typically mounted on streetlights, {{for the use of}} which Metricom negotiated agreements with municipal governments) and might [...] "bounce" [...] among several such units along the path between an end-user's modem and a wired internet access point; hence the name of the service. The wireless ISP service was an outgrowth of technology Metricom had developed to facilitate remote meter reading for utility companies. It was originally inspired by amateur packet radio, but differed from this technology in many respects: for instance, Ricochet used spread spectrum (FHSS) technology in the low-power [...] "license-free" [...] 900 MHz ISM band of the RF spectrum. In addition to the resistance to eavesdropping offered by FHSS, modems offered built-in encryption, but this was not turned on by default.|$|E

50|$|The Muscatatuck Urban Training Center {{is located}} {{on the grounds of the}} former Muscatatuck State Developmental Center (MSDC). MSDC was created in 1920 as the Indiana Farm Colony for the Feeble Minded. It became one of Indiana's largest mental {{institutions}} approximately 3,000 patients and around 2,000 employees. From 1920 through 2005, MSDC housed many of Indiana's challenged citizens and was once the largest employer in Jennings County. In 1997, Indiana lawmakers passed a plan to reorganize the state's health plan. Modern methods of mental illness treatment shrank its patient population down to about 12, and in 2001, Governor Frank O'Bannon announced that the state would close Muscatatuck. Governor Mitch Daniels passed control of the facility to the Indiana National Guard in July 2005.

[...] "Private companies are also using license plate readers and sharing the information they collect with police {{with little or no}} oversight or privacy protections.

50|$|The Chaco War, fought between Bolivia and Paraguay between 1932-5, {{was another}} {{conflict}} motivated by economics. The contested Gran Chaco region {{was thought to}} be rich in oil, with the international oil companies vying for exploitation rights - Standard Oil backing Bolivia, with Shell Oil supporting Paraguay. It could also provide a valuable access for either landlocked country to the Atlantic Ocean. To add to the problem, both Bolivia and Paraguay had lost significant territories in the previous century, and were keen to rebuild their strength. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932. Although much smaller, Paraguay undertook a complete mobilisation of its resources and fought the conflict in an unconventional style, making the war a more balanced proposition. Much of the <b>technology</b> <b>deployed</b> was new; Bolivia deployed three Vickers 6-Ton tanks during the war, and both sides making use of aerial warfare {{for the first time in}} South America. The cost of these new weapons was crippling to both sides. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated in 1935, Paraguay controlled most of the region. This was recognised in a 1938 truce, signed in Buenos Aires, under which Paraguay was awarded three-quarters of the disputed region, with Bolivia keeping the remaining territory. Some years later it was found that there were no oil resources in the Gran Chaco region kept by Paraguay, but the territories kept by Bolivia were, in fact, rich in natural gas and petroleum.|$|E
