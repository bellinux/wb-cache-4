40|$|Unexpected severe hull {{deformation}} {{caused by}} wave loads poses alignment {{problem to the}} propulsion shaft line in large scale ships, which would significantly influence the dynamical performance of the <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. How to suppress negative disturbance imposed by the interaction between water-hull-propulsion and ensure the normal operation of the <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> system is a challenging task. To address this issue, a new global sliding model control (GSMC) <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> water-hull-propulsion unit systems is proposed and investigated to obtain more accurate control performance {{in a series of}} researches. In Part 1 the GSMC controller has been developed and the bounded nonlinear model uncertainties have been derived based on the experiments and sea trial.

Numerical simulations based on the real bulk carrier parameters show a high effectiveness of the GSMC for speed tracking, compared with the traditional sliding model controller and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller.

40|$|An {{anti-spin}} controller <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{systems in}} rough seas is developed. From measurements of motor torque and propeller shaft speed, an observer providing an accurate {{estimate of the}} propeller load torque {{is used to calculate}} an estimate of the torque loss. A monitoring algorithm utilizing the estimated torque loss detects ventilation incidents, and activates the anti-spin control action. When a ventilation situation is detected, the anti-spin control action will reduce the propeller shaft speed to some optimal value, using a combined power/torque controller. The ultimate goal is to minimize the effect of ventilation, and hence increase the thrust production, limit the transients in the power system and reduce the mechanical wear and tear of the propulsion system components. Simulations are provided to validate the performance of the control scheme...|$|R
50|$|The Steam Infusion {{process was}} first {{conceived}} in 2000 {{as a method}} <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion.</b> The process has since been developed {{to be used for}} steam infusion. On the right a diagram shows how the process creates an environment of vaporised product surrounded by high energy steam. The supersonic steam flow entrains and vaporises the process flow to form a multiphase flow, which heats the suspended particles by surface conduction and condensation. The condensation of the steam causes the process flow to return to a liquid state. This causes rapid and uniform heating over the unit making it applicable to industrial cooking processes. This process has been used in industry, predominantly in soup and sauces applications. Its possible benefits include reduced cooking times, easier cleaning with no burn-on, ingredient reduction and energy savings.|$|R

With {{the addition of a}} supercharger or turbocharger, opposed-piston designs can make efficient two-stroke cycle Diesel engines. Attempts were made to build non-diesel 4-stroke engines, but as there is no cylinder head, the bad location of the valves and the spark plug makes them inefficient.|$|R

One notable exception are LNG carriers which use boil-off gas from the cargo tanks as fuel. However, even there the development of dual-fuel engines has pushed steam turbines into a niche market with about 10% market share in newbuildings in 2013. Lately, there has been some development in hybrid power plants where the steam turbine is used together with gas engines.

50|$|Combining {{two or more}} {{thermodynamic}} cycles {{results in}} improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a gas turbine (operating by the Brayton cycle) burning natural gas or synthesis gas from coal, whose hot exhaust powers a steam power plant (operating by the Rankine cycle). This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) thermal efficiency of around 54% in base-load operation, {{in contrast to a}} single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around 35-42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type. Such an arrangement is also used <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> <b>propulsion,</b> and is called a combined gas and steam (COGAS) plant. Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common.|$|R

We propose a multiscale approach for the inference problem that can be seen as an indirect inference scheme.
