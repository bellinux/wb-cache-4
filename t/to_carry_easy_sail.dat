40|$|The rapid {{development}} of wireless technology, the {{extensive use of}} mobile phones {{and the availability of}} location information are facilitating personalized location-based applications. <b>Easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry,</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and easy to buy, smart phones with certain software are of great advantage. Consequently, mobile social networking (MSN) systems have emerged rapidly, being a revolution for our everyday life. Based on the analysis of general requirements of MSN and location-based services (LBS), this paper presents the design of iZone, a mobile social networking system, as well as a prototype implementation. This platform exploits mobile GIS (Geographic Information Systems), LBS and J 2 ME technologies, combining geographical data to display map on mobile phones. It can provide a number of social networking services via smartphones.

50|$|The monopod {{allows a}} still camera {{to be held}} steadier, {{allowing}} the photographer to take sharp pictures at slower shutter speeds, and/or with longer focal length lenses. In the case of video, it reduces camera shake, and therefore most of the resulting small random movements. Monopods are easier to transport and quicker to set up than conventional tripods, making them preferable for on-the-go (OTG) photography. An OTG photographer is not able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a heavy, bulky tripod around, and {{when he or she}} sees a potential shot, there is no time to bother with setting up a complicated tripod. A simple monopod is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry,</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> set up, and enables the photographer {{to take advantage of the}} situation he or she is presented with, all while providing camera support to capture a clear, sharp image. Examples of situations in which a monopod is preferable include wildlife and sports photography where you can dramatically increase the stability of long lenses, travel photography, particularly around the golden hours and of course outdoor macro photography, especially when trying to photograph insects etc.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{innovations}} of form {{have been}} developed by ready-to-drink tea producers for variety of flavours. The highly competitive market for this product demands the producers to develop more distinctive product for consumers. This research was using qualitative approach with qualified quantitative data. Questionnaire and tactile testing were done to gather data. The questionnaires were given to respondents with age range of 11 - 17 years and 17 - 33 years old. The respondents are also given tactile test for each packaging for ready-to-drink tea. The target market for this research was young consumer with often-outdoor activities. Therefore they need abundant liquid intake. Nutrition rich tea in ready-to-drink packaging is one of solution for practical drink. With a high activity tendency, it is logical that the most preferred packaging for ready-to-drink tea is PET bottle. This type of packaging is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry,</b> <b>easy</b> storage for later consumption and hygienic in consumers perception. PET bottle is also could give better fresh sensation compared to other packaging. In specific, consumers like bottle with small diameter and tall opening. Bottle cap with rubber layer is more preferred because has it has maximum closure. For structure, bottle with curvy form, 60 degrees shoulder bottle, vertical and slanting shoulder is considered more attractive. ...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{persists}} as {{an integral}} component of active reading and other knowledge-worker tasks because it provides ease of use unmatched by digital alternatives. Paper documents are light <b>to</b> <b>carry,</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> annotate, rapid to navigate, flexible to manipulate, and robust to use in varied environments. Interactions with paper documents create rich webs of annotation, cross reference, and spatial organization. Unfortunately, the resulting webs are confined to the physical world of paper and, as they accumulate, become increasingly difficult to store, search, and access. XLibris [Schilit et al. 1998] and similar systems address these difficulties by simulating paper with tablet PCs. While this approach is promising, it suffers not only from limitations of current tablet computers (e. g., limited screen space) but also from loss of invaluable paper affordances. In this article, we describe PapierCraft, a gesture-based command system that allows users to manipulate digital documents using paper printouts as proxies. Using an Anoto [Anoto 2002] digital pen, users can draw command gestures on paper to tag a paragraph, e-mail a selected area, copy selections to a notepad, or create links to related documents. Upon pen synchronization, PapierCraft executes the commands and presents the results in a digital document viewer. Users can then search the tagged information and navigate the web of annotated digital document...|$|R

50|$|Muromachi period (1392-1568): Folding screens {{became more}} popular and {{were found in}} many residences, dojos, and shops. The two-panel byōbu were common, and {{overlapped}} paper hinges substituted for Zenigata, which made them lighter <b>to</b> <b>carry,</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> fold, and stronger at the joints. This technique allowed the depictions in the byōbu to be uninterrupted by panel vertical borders, which prompted artists to paint sumptuous, often monochromatic, nature-themed scenes and landscapes of famous Japanese locales. The paper hinges, although quite strong, required that the panel infrastructure be as light as possible. Softwood lattices were constructed using special bamboo nails that allowed for the lattice to be planed along its edges to be straight, square, and {{the same size as}} the other panels of the byōbu. The lattices were coated with one or more layers of paper stretched across the lattice surface like a drum head to provide a flat and strong backing for the paintings that would be later mounted on the byōbu. The resulting structure was lightweight and durable, yet still quite vulnerable. If you poke your finger into the surface of a panel and you miss a lattice member, your finger will likely pass clear through to the other side. After the paintings and brocade were attached, a lacquered wood frame (typically black or dark red) was applied to protect the outer perimeter of the byōbu, and intricately decorated metal hardware (strips, right angles, and studs) were applied to the frame to protect the lacquer.|$|R

This research was a mix method research that combines quantitative and qualitative research with concurent embedded design. Quantitative research used quasi-experiment design, conducted on 84 adolescent, divided in to two groups. Qualitative research conducted in 8 adolescents who received health education through the smartphone as an informant. Differences in knowledge and attitudes before and after health education through smartphones and booklets were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test. There was the differences between health education through smartphone and booklet on changed knowledge and attitudes of adolescents about reproductive health. The infleunces of health education through smartphone on knowledge and attitudes of adolescents about reproductive health is better than booklet (p < 0. 05).
