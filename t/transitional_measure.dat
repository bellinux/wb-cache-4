The {{legislation}} extended the two-for-one unit surrender <b>transitional</b> <b>measure</b> indefinitely beyond 2012, indefinitely deferred {{the entry of}} agriculture, introduced an offsetting option for pre-1990 forests, created a statutory power to auction NZ units within an overall cap, and finally changed {{the treatment of the}} synthetic greenhouse gas sector.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, several {{attempts}} have been made to reduce traffic congestion on Jakarta's main arteries. Implemented solutions include a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers are prohibited from driving on the main avenues. Another example is the ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day. In 2016, 'odd-even' policy was introduced which designated cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day. This aims to function as a <b>transitional</b> <b>measure</b> to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of Electronic Road Pricing which would be more effective.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{was limited}} to the current 19 municipalities. Many French-speakers complained that this did not {{correspond}} to the social reality, since the language border was {{based on the results of}} the 1947 language census and not that of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in Alsemberg, Beersel, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Strombeek-Bever, Sterrebeek, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, <b>transitional</b> <b>measure</b> to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.|$|E

25|$|As a <b>transitional</b> <b>measure,</b> for {{the first}} three years after the {{election}} of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the Oireachtas as an ordinary act. An amendment bill before the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) would have required a referendum. To prevent the Oireachtas abusing this provision, the President had the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in this way; President Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde's election, every amendment has had to follow the pattern of passage through the Oireachtas followed by a referendum.|$|E
500|$|The {{ninth and}} last {{section of the}} Constitution was added {{following}} passage of the 1996 revision of Constitution and addresses laws passed before 1996.

All changes to the Constitution come into effect when formally issued by the president, unless specified otherwise. With the passage of the 1996 revision of the Constitution, the 1994 law [...] "On the Procedure Governing the Entry into Force of the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus" [...] ceased to be enforced. As a <b>transitional</b> <b>measure,</b> Section Nine states that the present (as of November 1996) leadership of Belarus can continue to serve until their term of service has been completed. When the Constitution is enforced, the national government is allowed to exercise their assigned duties. Unless otherwise stated in Article 143, Part 3, the national leadership must form state governmental bodies two months after the Constitution goes into effect.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 North Korea {{argued the}} {{armistice}} {{was meant to}} be a <b>transitional</b> <b>measure.</b> It argued that North Korea had made a number of proposals for replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, but the U.S. had not responded in a serious way. [...] It further argued the Military Armistice Commission and Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission had long been effectively dismantled, paralysing the supervisory functions of the armistice. [...] North Korea believes the annual U.S. and South Korean exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are provocative and threaten North Korea with nuclear weapons. JoongAng Ilbo reported the U.S. vessels equipped with nuclear weapons were participating in the exercise, and The Pentagon publicly announced that B-52 bombers flown over South Korea were reaffirming the U.S. [...] "nuclear umbrella" [...] for South Korea.|$|E

These notes were issued, first, between 6 May and 10 June 1929 under the arrangement that the banks withdraw previous notes they issued and refrained from issue of further notes.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the 2004 {{accession}} negotiations, candidate countries requested the possibility to maintain existing national provisions restricting the acquisition of agricultural land or forests by foreigners. They considered these derogations necessary {{in order to protect the}} socio-economic agricultural structure of the countries from shocks that might arise from the differences in land prices and incomes with the rest of the Union, and to be able to pursue an effective agricultural policy. The objective of this study is to review these <b>transitional</b> <b>measures</b> and their effects. To that end, the study analyses the agricultural sector in the NMS- 7 and its evolution since the period of negotiation and accession. It compares these findings with the situation in the EU, especially among the ‘old’ member states. The study takes stock of the transitional restrictions effectively maintained by the NMS- 7 and reviews the conditions that led to an agreement on <b>transitional</b> <b>measures</b> at the time of accession. It analyses the impacts of the restrictions on the sector and draws conclusions about their relevance and usefulness, and the necessity of maintaining them throughout the transitional periods...|$|R
