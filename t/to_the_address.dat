Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice {{to get rid of the}} trampoline. After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the trampoline to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E

The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, {{less than or equal}} to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>address</b> of the instruction following the conditional branch.|$|E

A lock flag and locked physical address register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support.
