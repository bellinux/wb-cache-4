25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is immaterial <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>is</b> the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.|$|E
25|$|Also, the 21st century Missouri {{electorate}} is {{much less}} urbanized {{than that of the}} 20th century. In 1900, the combined population of St. Louis (575,238) and Kansas City (163,752) was 24% of the population of Missouri (3,106,665), while by 1950 the combined population of St. Louis (856,796) and Kansas City (456,622) had actually grown to 33% of the population of Missouri (3,954,653). But shortly thereafter the population of St. Louis began a sharp decline, while that of Kansas City remained nearly static, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> now much more dominated by rural, suburban, and small-city voters, who are generally more conservative: by 2000 the combined populations of St. Louis (348,189) and Kansas City (441,545) had declined to 14% of the population of Missouri (5,595,211). This shift, however, is a direct product of the small geographic size of St. Louis City, which is nearly unique among major urban centers in having locked its boundaries in 1876. When the population of St. Louis County is included in these figures, Missouri's ratio of major metropolitan residents to rural residents closely matches the nation as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Many others {{argued that}} the ship should be removed. Louise Solliday, the {{director}} of the Oregon Department of State Lands, called the removal of the stern a necessary step to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> [...] "serious about removing wrecks". She stated that if the stern were not removed, the argument that the ship is trespassing on state property (used in the state's lawsuit against New Carissa owners) would be undermined should another vessel wreck off the Oregon coast. The sentiment was later echoed by Oregon Secretary of State Bill Bradbury, who also noted that the settlement of the lawsuit with the ship's owners leaves the state exposed to any liability issues concerning the ship. Many environmentalists, as well as federal biologists and residents of the local community, were concerned about the potential for further ecological damage should the vessel leak any of the fuel oil that remained on board. The editorial board of The Oregonian argued that allowing the stern to remain would send a message <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> willing to [...] "tolerate permanent damage to its beaches". The newspaper also rejected the notion that the wreckage should be compared to the Peter Iredale, a sailing ship that wrecked on a beach near Astoria in the early 1900s, and whose remnants are a popular tourist draw.|$|E

500|$|Murray Newton Rothbard ( [...] ; March 2, 1926– January 7, 1995) was an American economist, philosopher, {{political}} theorist, and historian.

500|$|The {{idea for}} a station in Laurence Harbor was first {{proposed}} by developer in Michael Alfieri in 1985. His original proposal in the community was to create and constructed a so-called [...] "Metropark South", to consist of residential homes, commercial businesses, and a brand-new train station. The proposal received approval, but only the residential portion of the proposal was ever built. This residential area, consisting of high-class townhouses, is known as [...] "Bridgepointe". In August 2001, several years after the partially constructed project was started, the staff at New Jersey Transit proposed the design and construction of a station at Laurence Harbor near Exit 120 on the Garden State Parkway, which would serve the North Jersey Coast Line. At that time, the tracks passed through Laurence Harbor between the South Amboy and Aberdeen-Matawan stations. A spokesperson from New Jersey Transit reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> working with Old Bridge Township (where Laurence Harbor is a part) to make preliminary designs. The costs for the designs began around $300,000 (2001 USD) for a two-year study. The station was proposed to relieve major congestion on four of the major state highways in the community including Route 18, Route 34, Route 35, and U.S. Route 9. Old Bridge's mayor, Barbara Cannon, gave full support for the new station, who previously passed a unanimous resolution for the proposal. The township also reported that this would help qualify Old Bridge as a city and receive more state funding.|$|E

500|$|Towards her [...] "weak perfectionist" [...] liberalism, Levinson {{requires}} three {{traits of}} a liberal society: (1) an agreeable, transparent, and equally accessible [...] "legitimation process" [...] for government, (2) pluralism, and (3) [...] "substantive liberal institutions" [...] such as [...] "individual liberties and ... governmental duties". She pairs this view of liberalism with thick autonomy as [...] "the only defensible interpretation of liberalism". Levinson develops an idea of autonomy that would be agreeable to most citizens while sufficient to guarantee liberalism's [...] "substantive liberal institutions", and defines it as [...] "higher-order preference formation" [...] that minds one's personal values while allowing for openness to criticism and a developed personality. She argues that capacity for autonomy is a right to children, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> obligated to facilitate it, and that children are obligated to receive it. In this way, Levinson's stance {{is that the state}} must make education compulsory. Children require paternalistic decisions of some sort, and the state is best suited to promote consent and operate {{in the best interests of}} children. The state has a right to override lack of child and parental interest in such an autonomy-promoting education, since such an override lets children decide their values later in life, as adults, as opposed to never having that opportunity. Levinson contends that parents, on the other hand, must provide for the well-being, identity development, and [...] "cultural coherence" [...] sense of their children.|$|E
