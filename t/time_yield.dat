5000|$|Jojoba prefers light, coarsly {{textured}} soils. Good drainage {{and water}} penetration is necessary. It tolerates salinity and poor-nutrient soils. Soil pH should be between 5 and 8. High temperatures are tolerated by jojoba, but frost can damage or kill plants. [...] Requirements are poor because jojoba plants {{do not need}} an intensive cultivation. Weed problems only occur {{during the first two}} years after planting and there is little damage by insects. Supplemental irrigation could maximize production if rainfall as less than 400 mm. There is no need for high fertilisation, but, especially in the first year, nitrogen increases growth. Jojoba is normally harvested by hand because seeds do not all mature in the same <b>time.</b> <b>Yield</b> is around 3.5 t/ha depending on the age of the plantation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditions of}} {{origin of the}} Ijigban, like the traditions of origins of many Nigerian, {{including}} the Idoma peoples {{as a whole is}} highly problematic. The word [...] "Origins" [...] in the strict anthropological sense refers to the emergence of a species of either plant or animal as distinct from another species". Traditions of origin in the context of Ijigban here are stories which people use to explain where their ancestors came from. As well as how they arrived at the place they presently occupy. Although traditions of origins often <b>time</b> <b>yield</b> towards the Hamitic hypothesis. The case of the Ijigban people of the southern Ado is quite unique, given evidence under available sources. In this wise, we shall adopt a comprehensive approaches to examine the various versions of the Ijigban’s traditions of origin.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{combination}} of chromatographic methods, purification of the target molecule is achieved. The purpose of purifying proteins with FPLC is to deliver quantities of the target at sufficient purity in a biologically active state to suit its further use. The quality of the end product varies depending the type and amount of starting material, efficiency of separation, and selectivity of the purification resin. The ultimate goal of a given purification protocol is to deliver the required yield and purity of the target molecule in the quickest, cheapest, and safest way for acceptable results.The range of purity required can be from that required for basic analysis (SDS-PAGE or ELISA, for example), with only bulk impurities removed, to pure enough for structural analysis (NMR or X-ray crystallography), approaching >99% target molecule. Purity required can also mean pure enough that the biological activity of the target is retained. These demands {{can be used to}} determine the amount of starting material required to reach the experimental goal.If the starting material is limited and full optimization of purification protocol cannot be performed, then a safe standard protocol that requires a minimum adjustment and optimization steps are expected. This may not be optimal with respect to experimental <b>time,</b> <b>yield,</b> and economy but it will achieve the experimental goal. On the other hand, if the starting material is enough to develop more complete protocol, the amount of work to reach the separation goal depends on the available sample information and target molecule properties. Limits to development of purification protocols many times depends on the source of the substance to be purified, whether from natural sources (harvested tissues or organisms, for example), recombinant sources (such as using prokaryotic or eukaryotic vectors in their respective expression systems), or totally synthetic sources.|$|E

40|$|Electroenzymatic syntheses combine oxidoreductase-catalysed {{reactions}} with electrochemical reactant supply. The use of ionic liquids as performance additives {{can contribute}} to overcoming existing limitations of these syntheses. Here, {{we report on the}} influence of different water-miscible ionic liquids on critical parameters such as conductivity, biocatalyst activity and stability or substrate solubility for three typical electroenzymatic syntheses. In these investigations promising ionic liquids were identified and have been used as additives for batch electrolyses on preparative scale for the three electroenzymatic systems. It was possible to improve the space-time-yield for the electrochemical regeneration of NADPH by a factor of three. For an amino acid oxidase catalysed resolution of a methionine racemate with ferrocene-mediated electrochemical regeneration of the enzyme-bound cofactor FAD a 50 % increase in space <b>time</b> <b>yield</b> and 140 % increase in catalyst utilisation (TTN) were achieved. Furthermore, for the chloroperoxidase-catalysed synthesis of (R) -phenylmethylsulfoxide with electrochemical generation of the required cosubstrate H 2 O 2 the space <b>time</b> <b>yield</b> and the catalyst utilisation were improved by a factor of up to 4. 2 depending on the ionic liquids used...|$|E
