5000|$|The station, {{which is}} located at line-kilometre 98.23 of the Dresden-Werdau railway, was opened on 15 November 1858. At first, the station was in neither Hohenstein nor Ernstthal, but in Oberlungwitz in the {{district}} of Abtei. The station site was later purchased by Hohenstein. From 1860 to 1887, the Hohenstein post office was located in the station building. In 1913, the station included 13 tracks. From 17 March 1913 to 26 March 1960, the station forecourt was the starting point of the Hohenstein-Ernstthal-Oelsnitz Tramway. The freight traffic of the tramway was handled next to the freight yard and two loading tracks, a <b>transhipment</b> <b>track,</b> a wooden transhipment hall with a loading crane and a siding to the freight shed were built. Until the summer timetable change on 30 May 1976, the so-called Stadt- und Vorortbahnverkehr ("urban and suburban railway service", an S-Bahn-like system) operated between Hohenstein-Ernstthal and Flöha.|$|E

The main design parameters are identified (length and utilisation of <b>transhipment</b> <b>tracks,</b> train and truck arrival behaviour/patterns, type and number of handling equipment, mean stacking height in the storage area, terminal access system and procedures) and analysed. A comparative evaluation of selected conventional and advanced technologies is performed by use of an analysis tool that was developed on purpose. This tool consists of three modules (an expert system, a simulation model and a cost calculation module). The overall outcome of the analysis is a number of cost-versus-volume curves for various terminal configurations. The paper concludes with two groups of results: (a) a comparative evaluation of conventional and advanced technologies that reveals similarities in terms of track numbers and the associated area requirements as well as differences in terms of layout flexibility, number of equipment, stacking policies and personnel requirements. Each design is proved effective for a certain cargo volume range. (b) A critical assessment of terminal capacity issues. It is identified that the capacity limitations are imposed mainly by the sidings/transhipment track sub-system rather than by th...|$|R
