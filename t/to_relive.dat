5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults <b>to</b> <b>relive</b> the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|With Lenin now {{based in}} Geneva, the {{arguments}} between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after the conference. The Bolsheviks accused their rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked any discipline, while the Mensheviks accused Lenin {{of being a}} despot and autocrat, comparing him to Maximilien de Robespierre. When Plekhanov sided with Martov, Lenin flew into a rage and resigned from both the Iskra editorial board and the Party Council. In May 1904, he published One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, a booklet claiming that Martov's supporters had tricked him into this. The stress added to an illness, {{which at the time}} was probably diagnosed as neurasthenia, and <b>to</b> <b>relive</b> this, he went on a climbing holiday in the countryside in June. Some party members attempted to reunite the feuding factions, but this failed, and by the spring, all eight members of the Central Committee were Bolsheviks. In December, they founded a Bolshevik newspaper, Vperëd (Forward).|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that hostile and nonhostile individuals would differ in both magnitude {{and duration of}} cardiovascular reactivity <b>to</b> <b>relived</b> anger was tested.

Each {{took part in a}} structured interview scored using the Interpersonal Hostility Assessment Technique. Later each relived a self-chosen anger memory while heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured continuously using an Ohmeda Finapres monitor.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} changes in intrusive memories associated with imaginal reliving of traumatic events in {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). The study population comprised 44 patients treated with imaginal reliving {{in the context of}} cognitive therapy for PTSD [Behav. Res. Ther. 38 (2000) 319 - 345]. For most patients, imaginal reliving did not lead to exacerbations in intrusion frequency. The decrease in intrusion frequency after reliving was gradual, as was the decrease in their distress, vividness, and perceived "nowness. " Poorer outcome, i. e., a smaller reduction in residual gain scores for intrusion frequency with reliving, was associated with greater initial PTSD severity, greater anger, greater perceived "nowness" of intrusive memories, and more negative interpretations of PTSD symptoms. The patient's anxiety, depression, self-blame, and dissociation were not predictive of response <b>to</b> <b>reliving...</b>|$|R
50|$|The play {{opens in}} a county home (an {{inpatient}} psychiatric facility) in Baltinglass, Ireland in 1932, some years after Irish independence.

40|$|Copyright © 1999 by Ron F. Newbold. Stanislav Grof’s four {{perinatal}} matrices {{provide a}} useful guide to why {{certain types of}} imagery appear in the Star Wars trilogy and to {{the dynamics of the}} struggle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The human struggle to be born imprints experiences upon the neonate so strongly that they influence the nature of postnatal imagination and behavior. That primal struggle tends <b>to</b> be constantly <b>relived</b> throughout our lives. So when films such as Star Wars project imagery evocative of that struggle, they mirror and evoke memories powerfully present in the unconscious. The opportunity <b>to</b> vicariously <b>relive</b> those experiences is part of the attraction of the trilogy, contributing to its unparalleled worldwide appeal...|$|R
500|$|Sharky Extreme praised FreeSpace 2 {{for having}} the {{enormous}} capital ships, as this burst the [...] "trapped in a bubble" [...] trend in Wing Commander- and - type games. Instead of the action simply coming to the player, it flows all around, and the player {{is the one who}} has to go and seek it. The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming around in their little dances of death, have led reviewers to feel a sense of epicness, comparable <b>to</b> <b>reliving</b> battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars. Similarly, PC Gamer praised the scaling of ships and battles and said that they [...] " [...] as close to creating the feeling of a World War II naval battle in space as any game has ever come" [...] and that [...] "That's what fighter combat, in space or on Earth, should be all about.".|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} {{that underlie the}} effectiveness of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are examined by evaluating the procedural differences between it and exposure therapy. Major factors include the degree of emphasis placed on reliving versus distancing in the therapies {{and the degree to}} which clients are encouraged to focus on direct trauma experiences versus experiences associated with the trauma. Research results indicate that, unlike traditional imaginal exposure, reliving responses in EMDR did not correlate with symptom improvement. Instead, consistent with an information processing model, the degree of distancing in EMDR was significantly associated with improvement. A case study is described to highlight these methodological divergences in the respective therapies relating <b>to</b> <b>reliving.</b> Finally, the research regarding the possible sources of the distancing response within EMDR was examined. The results indicate that the distancing process was more likely to be an effect produced by eye movements than by any therapist instructions. Theoretical and research evaluations indicate that the mechanisms underlying EMDR and traditional exposure therapy are different...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} whether {{heart rate}} (HR) responses to voluntary recall of trauma memories (a) {{are related to}} posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (b) predict recovery 6 months later. Sixty-two assault survivors completed a recall task modeled on imaginal reliving in the initial weeks postassault. Possible cognitive modulators of HR responsivity were assessed; dissociation, rumination, trauma memory disorganization. Individuals with PTSD showed a reduced HR response <b>to</b> <b>reliving</b> compared <b>to</b> those without PTSD, but reported greater distress. Notably, higher HR response but not self-reported distress during reliving predicted greater symptom reduction at follow-up in participants with PTSD. Engagement in rumination was the only cognitive factor that predicted lower HR response. The data are in contrast to studies using trauma reminders to trigger memories, which have found greater physiological reactivity in PTSD. The authors' observations are consistent with models of PTSD that highlight differences between cued or stimulus-driven retrieval and intentional trauma recall, and with E B. Foa and M. J. Kozak (1986) hypothesis that full activation of trauma memories facilitates emotional processing...|$|R
