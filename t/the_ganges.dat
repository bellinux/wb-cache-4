5|$|Being {{located in}} the Indo-Gangetic Plains of North India, the land is very fertile because low level floods in <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> {{continually}} replenish the soil. Varanasi is located between <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around , {{and serves as a}} sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.|$|E

5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to <b>the</b> <b>Ganges.</b> He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E
5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} inactive basin, extremely high population densities in <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> and Ayeyarwady Deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|Dating back to 1919, M-89 was {{originally}} just {{a segment of}} the current highway between <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> area and Martin. Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County. The last section was paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan, Michigan area. The last extensions into Battle Creek came in the 1960s and 1998.|$|E
5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, near <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> River, {{were the}} Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). Fearing the {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E
5|$|Major Himalayan-origin {{rivers that}} {{substantially}} flow through India include <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> and the Brahmaputra, {{both of which}} drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.|$|E

5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified and turned to the northeast, becoming a cyclonic storm on October 20. The storm became the second severe cyclonic storm of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E

5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
5|$|Four {{families}} of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated <b>the</b> <b>Ganges</b> and Indus River dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.|$|E
