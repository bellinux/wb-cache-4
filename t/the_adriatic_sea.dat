5000|$|In 1896 the mountain, then {{belonging}} to Austria-Hungary, was {{mentioned in the}} journal of the Österreichischer Alpenverein. The summit was reached {{for the first time in}} 1895 by Franz Hofer and Fritz Kögl. On 16 July 1904 the Italian nationalist, irredentist, and later fascist Ettore Tolomei climbed the mountain, proclaimed himself the first to reach its summit, asserted that it was the northernmost point of <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea's</b> drainage basin and thus belonged to Italy, and named it [...] "Vetta d'Italia" [...] ("Peak of Italy"). However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) defines the northernmost point of Italy as the summit not of Glockenkarkopf, but of nearby [...] (2841 m), which is slightly farther north and is in fact the northernmost point of <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea's</b> drainage basin.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} surface solar {{radiation}} on the optical properties and the biological availability of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and its humic and nonhumic component was investigated in <b>the</b> northern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea</b> (448529 N 138529 E) and the coastal North Sea (538009 N 48459 E). In <b>the</b> northern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea,</b> humic substances of primarily autochthonous origin contributed, on average, 15 % to the bulk DOC, whereas in the coastal North Sea the mean contribution of the mainly terrestrially derived humic substances to the bulk DOC was about 43 %. DOC-normalized absorbance and fluorescence were both; 1. 5 -fold higher, and the absorbance ratio 250 : 365 nm was twofold higher for the humic DOC of <b>the</b> northern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea</b> {{as compared to the}} coastal North Sea. Bioassay experiments with indigenous bacterioplankton indicated a; 5 times higher DOC-normalized bacterial growth on the humic and nonhumic DOC from <b>the</b> northern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea</b> as compared to the corresponding fractions from the coastal North Sea. Exposure of the different DOC fractions to surface solar radiation for 5 – 8 h and subsequent inoculation with a natural bacterial community resulted in stimulated bacterial growth on the preexposed humic and nonhumic DOC by 35 and 45 %, respectively, as compared to the corresponding dark controls for <b>the</b> northern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea,</b> whereas in <b>the</b> coastal North Sea stimulated bacterial growth (by 50 %) was found only for the humic DOC. The increase in the DOC bioavailability upon irradiation was linearly related to a decrease in the absorbance and an increase i...|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> name <b>Adriatic</b> {{are linked to}} the Etruscan {{settlement}} of Adria, which probably derives its name from the Illyrian adur meaning water or sea. In classical antiquity, the sea was known as Mare Adriaticum (Mare Hadriaticum, also sometimes simplified to Adria) or, less frequently, as Mare Superum, [...] "the upper sea". The two terms were not synonymous, however. Mare Adriaticum generally corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea's</b> extent, spanning from the Gulf of Venice to the Strait of Otranto. That boundary became more consistently defined by Roman authors—early Greek sources place the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> and Ionian <b>seas</b> at various places ranging from adjacent to the Gulf of Venice to the southern tip of the Peloponnese, eastern shores of Sicily and western shores of Crete. Mare Superum on the other hand normally encompassed both <b>the</b> modern <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea</b> and <b>the</b> sea off the Apennine peninsula's southern coast, as far as the Strait of Sicily. Another name used in the period was Mare Dalmaticum, applied to waters off the coast of Dalmatia or Illyricum.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> <b>Sea's</b> coasts and islands, {{there are}} {{numerous}} small settlements, {{and a number of}} larger cities. Among the largest are Bari, Venice, Trieste, and Rimini in Italy, Split, Rijeka and Zadar in Croatia, Durrës and Vlorë in Albania and Koper in Slovenia. In total, more than 3.5 million people live on <b>the</b> <b>Adriatic</b> coasts. There are also some larger cities that are located very near the coast, such as the Italian cities of Ravenna and Lecce.|$|R

However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for all intents and purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs.

It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay.
