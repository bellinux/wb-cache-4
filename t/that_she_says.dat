In 1985, she {{took a job at}} the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia. She worked there for six years, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. Cornwell wrote three novels <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> were rejected before the publication, in 1990, of the first installment of her Scarpetta series, Postmortem, based on real-life stranglings in Richmond in the summer of 1987. The novel won her various awards including the British John Creasey Award, the French Prix du Roman d'Adventure and the American Edgar Award.|$|E

Shortly before her 15th birthday, {{she wrote a}} letter to producers Bloodshy & Avant requesting that they offer a recording contract to her, which she says happened [...] "kind of right off the bat" [...] after they came across her profile. In 2009, she was signed to Parlophone, and began finalizing the debut studio album <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> was first begun when she was 14 years old.

Unlike other persocoms, her activation switch is located in an unusual place: her crotch.

500|$|A 55-year-old {{woman from}} England {{tells the story}} of how she was first prostituted in Boscombe, near Bournemouth in Dorset, after being raped as a child in the council houses where she grew up. She {{describes}} running away, being raped again at the age of 13 and then being locked in a wardrobe in Manchester, and says that she found this situation normal at the time as it was the only life she knew. She eventually became addicted to heroin. She then describes a vision of Jesus <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> gave her the strength to escape sexual trafficking at the age of 40 and heroin six years later. Other victims of trafficking speak about having been the objects of physical abuse and attempted murder. Nevada prostitutes describe having gone into prostitution in Las Vegas after watching the film Pretty Woman. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. Some of them cry while telling their stories. Lobert calls prostitution [...] "the greatest acting job", explaining that prostitutes have to constantly feign enjoyment while actually feeling none. Before Nefarious was completed, one of the former prostitutes interviewed for the film returned to prostitution, a fact acknowledged in the film.|$|E

2500|$|In a later development, feminist theorist Alison Assiter {{enumerated}} four ideas <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> {{are common}} to {{the various forms of}} structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the [...] "real things" [...] that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E
2500|$|The first part, [...] "The Thieving Magpie", {{begins with}} Toru Okada, a low-key {{unemployed}} man, who is tasked by his wife, Kumiko, {{to find their}} missing cat. Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung {{out there for a}} while with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later on to crawl into and think.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Joseph Conte {{describes}} the epic {{as a long}} poem that [...] "has to have grand voice and purpose[...] [...] it has to say something big." [...] Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a [...] "quasi-circular quest-journey structure" [...] <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> {{is present in the}} long poem Song of Myself by Whitman. [...] Yet that long poem, Keller notes, does not have a [...] "specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed," [...] unlike a more traditional long poem. [...] Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic. [...] A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in Helen In Egypt by H.D. [...] Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, Helen In Egypt is about the psychological journey of Helen.|$|E

By 1981, she and {{her children}} had moved to their own home {{across the street from the}} palace, where Irene did traditional household chores like grocery shopping. In 1983 and 1985, she publicly spoke out against the additional deployment of NATO missiles at a large anti-nuclear rally in The Hague and with a letter to the newspaper De Volkskrant. Her connection with nature, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> she had felt since childhood, intensified, and in 1995 she published her book Dialogue with Nature. The book outlined her philosophy that human beings are alienated from the natural world, but the Dutch media seized upon passages that recounted conversations she said she had with the trees and dolphins.|$|E

2500|$|Ain't I a Woman? {{examines}} several recurring {{themes in}} her later work: the historical impact of sexism and racism on black women, devaluation of black womanhood, media roles and portrayal, the education system, {{the idea of}} a white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy, the marginalization of black women, and the disregard for issues of race and class within feminism. Since the publication of Ain't I a Woman?, she has become eminent as a leftist and postmodern political thinker and cultural critic. She targets and appeals to a broad audience by presenting her work in a variety of media using various writing and speaking styles. As well as having written books, she has published in numerous scholarly and mainstream magazines, lectures at widely accessible venues, and appears in various documentaries.She is frequently cited by feminists as having provided the best solution to the difficulty of defining something as diverse as [...] "feminism", addressing the problem that if feminism can mean everything, it means nothing. She asserts an answer to the question [...] "what is feminism?" [...] <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> is [...] "rooted in neither fear nor fantasy...

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} {{there had been}} these two prior public adjudications of the same matter, first in 1979, then in 1992, Bishop Bennison's critics {{said that he had}} concealed the alleged abuse of the minor from church authorities and police. [...] Charles Bennison initially said he had learned of the allegations from the girl's parents and promptly fired his brother. He acknowledged not having reported the matter to civil or ecclesiastical authorities at the time, saying, [...] "I did not think it was my prerogative to do so on my own" [...] (because the girl's parents had not chosen to report the matter to the police). The girl's mother, June Alexis, disputed this account, based on a 1978 letter from Bennison <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> indicate that he knew that their daughter was being abused by his brother, but did not tell them. John's ex-wife, Margaret Thompson, produced another letter from 1979 in which Charles Bennison asked her not to visit the parish because of the potential for [...] "a public scandal here which, I believe, could cost me my job." [...] John's victim has stated that [...] "she and John were twice interrupted during sex by Charles Bennison's arrival at his brother's apartment" [...] (although it is unclear whether she alleges that Bishop Bennison saw them in a compromising situation).|$|E
2500|$|Heart Beats {{features}} {{a mixture of}} ballads and up-tempo pop songs. In terms of musical direction, Im attempted to avoid going for one particular sound as she wanted Heart Beats [...] "to be an album that people of all generations can listen to, not just the younger generation". She described the album as having different moods that show who she is {{as a person and}} as an artist. The album's opening track [...] "Super Love" [...] is an up-tempo dance-pop and synthpop song, with lyrics that represent Im's love for her husband Noah Kim and [...] "the many other aspects of life that evoke" [...] love. Jake Cleland of The Vine compared [...] "Super Love" [...] to David Guetta's work, Avicii's [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2013) and Katy Perry's [...] "Firework" [...] (2010). The second song [...] "Gladiator" [...] is a mid-tempo pop ballad that explores the theme of female empowerment, as Im sings about the need to make a man fall in love with her by fighting for his love [...] "like a gladiator". Several critics also compared [...] "Gladiator" [...] to Perry's work. The sixth track, [...] "Speak Up", is Im's favourite track on the album. It is a ballad <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>says</b> [...] "really explores all the vocal ranges". Lyrically, the song is about [...] "speaking out" [...] and [...] "showing the world who [...] is as a person". [...] The seventh track on Heart Beats is Im's cover version of the 2010 Macy Gray song [...] "Beauty in the World". The tenth track [...] "Heart Beats Again" [...] was solely written by Im.|$|E
