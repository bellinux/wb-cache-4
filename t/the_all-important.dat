5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, {{they were}} unwilling to further weaken {{the ability of the}} U.S. to defend itself through the scattering of <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an improbable challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> second goal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the Villard regime, in {{another one of}} its costly missteps, {{attempted}} to stretch the Northern Pacific from the Twin Cities to <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> rail hub of Chicago, Illinois. A costly project was begun in creating a union station and terminal facilities for a Northern Pacific which had yet to arrive.|$|E

25|$|Watson's next tournament {{after the}} Australian Open was the Pattaya Open {{where she was}} the 8th seed. In the first round Watson comfortably {{defeated}} Tímea Babos, setting up a second round meeting with Latvia Anastasija Sevastova. Watson surprisingly lost but picked herself up to help Great Britain reach a World Group II play-off tie in the Fed Cup which included impressive victories over Tímea Babos of Hungary and Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria in <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> Euro/Africa Group I play-off.|$|E
25|$|A goal kick is an {{important}} 'set piece' that will occur many times in a game and yet few teams practice it. If taken quickly the kick may be taken short to a full-back who has run into a wide position. Although this may gain little ground it retains <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> possession of the ball. A longer kick to the midfield is more common and {{it is vital that}} the midfield unit {{are in a position to}} receive it.|$|E
25|$|Toungoo’s {{inevitable}} {{break with}} Ava came {{soon after the}} death of Minkhaung II in 1501. The new king Narapati II (r. 1501–27) was greeted with a new round of rebellions. By 1502, Mingyi Nyo had already decided to break away despite Narapati’s desperate attempt to retain his loyalty by granting <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> Kyaukse granary. In 1503, Nyo’s forces began surreptitiously aiding ongoing rebellions in the south. In 1504, he openly entered into an alliance with Prome with the intention of taking over all of Central Burma. But Ava was not yet a spent force. It decisively defeated the alliance’s raids in 1504–05 and in 1507–08.|$|E

50|$|Before World War II Napier had {{licensed}} the Junkers Jumo 204 diesel {{design to}} set up production in the UK as the Napier Culverin, but {{the onset of the}} war made <b>the</b> Sabre <b>all-important</b> and work on the Culverin was stopped. In response to the Air Ministry's 1945 requirements Napier dusted off this work, combining two enlarged Culverins into an H-block similar to the Sabre, resulting in a massive 75 litre design. Markets for an engine of this size seemed limited, however, so instead they reverted to the original Sabre-like horizontally opposed 12 cylinder design, and the result was the Nomad.|$|R
25|$|Davout {{sent the}} III Corps trains {{along the river}} road from Regensburg to Abensberg. General of Division Louis Friant's 2nd Division, General of Division Charles-Étienne Gudin de La Sablonnière's 3rd Division, and General of Division Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice's 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division {{protected}} the wagon train. Flank protection was provided by General of Division Charles Antoine Morand's 1st Division, General of Division Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's 4th Division, and General of Division Louis-Pierre Montbrun's Light Cavalry Division.

25|$|Each {{company was}} to build two prototypes (although Kawasaki only built one) to be {{completed}} by 1979; one for flight testing and the others for tie down testing and static testing. MBB's flying prototype made its first flight at Ottobrunn on 13 June 1979, followed by the Kawasaki prototype at Gifu on 10 August 1979. Development was slower than expected, a problem made worse by shortages of skilled manpower available at MBB. Although it was originally planned for airworthiness certification to be achieved before the end of 1980, German certification was not achieved until 9 December 1982, with Japanese certification following on 17 December, and <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> United States FAA certification being obtained on 29 March 1983.|$|E
25|$|Attack {{criteria}} and approval: The political {{dimensions of the}} attack were carefully considered, such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials. Planning involved a coordinated effort by military and logistics staff and <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> political operatives, the party cadres who had the last word. Proposals for an operation were first sent up the chain of command. Depending {{on the scale of}} the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.|$|E

25|$|By late 1920, Makhno had halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine {{from the}} southwest, {{capturing}} 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining control of <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> Ukrainian grain harvest. Upon {{the signing of}} a truce in the Polish–Soviet War further west, additional Red Army were freed to also participate in the southern campaign that pursued Wrangel and {{the remainder of his}} forces down the Crimean peninsula. To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars. The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal.|$|E
25|$|The SVR {{have been}} offered first refusal by BRB (Residuary) Ltd. on <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> tunnel under Bridgnorth as the first {{essential}} part of the plan. If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, not least of which is that all of the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel. The group currently promoting such an extension has identified a viable technical solution to this and other difficulties.|$|E
50|$|L’Enfant trouvé gave Candide its {{original}} idyllic childhood setting, its principal characters and themes, including <b>the</b> protagonist’s <b>all-important</b> journey of self-discovery, {{which is also}} his quest for love...Le Cosmopolite gave Voltaire {{the idea of a}} wide-ranging and seemingly random European journey, conferring on Candide the world view that Voltaire clearly wished to emphasize. Still, it is doubtful whether either the optimistic Enfant trouvé or the cynical Cosmopolite would on their own have provided Voltaire with enough inspiration to write Candide. Rather, it was the mysterious combination of these two works together with a variety of other thoughts and texts in the crucible of Voltaire’s imagination that gave birth to what critics have since baptized 'le moment Candide'.|$|R

50|$|Zahoor {{invested}} in journalists, increased distribution and improved newsprint.

However, despite the investments, the Kyiv Post never regained consistent profitability, despite further staff and cost cuts, as print advertising continued to shrink, especially in <b>the</b> once <b>all-important</b> sector of employment advertising. However, combined with Zahoor's subsidies, the newspaper has been able to minimize financial losses through special publications, such as the Legal Quarterly, and special events, such as the Tiger Conference and others.

25|$|Today {{there are}} 20 {{approved}} stallions and 160 broodmares {{in the northern}} population of heavy warmbloods. They are bred with a pure-breeding scheme, using Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburg, Groningen, Saxony-Thuringian Heavy Warmbloods, and Silesian Heavy Warmbloods. The goal is a versatile, correct and balanced horse with a calm temperament. Desirable is a horse with a strong constitution, peaceful companionable temperament, which utilizes its feed well, has high fertility, and is suitable as a riding and driving horse. The walk and trot should be efficient and expansive, the latter with some action. The physique should speak of a moderately elegant horse of great depth and breadth, well-sprung ribs and a strong hind end. The head should be expressive with a large, friendly eye. The neck is muscular, medium-length, well-formed and set high on a long, sloping, muscular shoulder with defined withers. The back is medium-long, solid and elastic with a broad loin, the croup slightly sloped, wide and muscular.

25|$|The {{situation}} is desperate for the Bene Gesserit as {{they find themselves}} the targets of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene Gesserit and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now {{in command of the}} Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> sandworms, whose native planet Dune had been destroyed by the Matres. Sheeana, in charge of the project, expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire Bene Tleilax civilization, with Tleilaxu Master Scytale the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of ghola production, which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently deceased military genius, Miles Teg. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest Duncan Idaho ghola, and former Honored Matre Murbella, whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres.|$|E
25|$|As Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) begins, Duke Leto Atreides {{finds himself}} in a {{dangerous}} position; the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has put him {{in control of the}} desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune, which is the only natural source of <b>the</b> <b>all-important</b> spice melange. The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms which protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap; failure to meet or exceed the production volume of their predecessors, the vicious House Harkonnen, will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits. Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.|$|E

The Qur'an acknowledges that humans are not <b>the</b> only <b>all-important</b> creatures and emphasizes a respect for nature.
