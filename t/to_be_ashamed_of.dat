500|$|Emer O'Toole of The Guardian {{noted that}} [...] "we {{live in a}} society in which young women are taught <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> the changes that their bodies undergo at puberty – to be secretive about them, and even to pretend that they don't exist."

500|$|Additional {{controversy}} developed {{after the}} battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, {{but there is no}} historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would [...] "lead from the rear", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> if he coordinated his forces from behind.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst {{continued}} to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry and something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b> t is a great thing to be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance." [...] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia. Norwich City fans were at first astonished {{by the sight of}} the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head. In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, [...] "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout [...] "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b> Sorry, Bryan."

I'm not blaming anyone, because we all accepted it, we all collaborated... but it was a mistake." [...] Rodgers later stated that the show was [...] "too preachy, which was the one fault that Oscar had, if any," [...] and [...] "othing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of,</b> certainly". [...] Rodgers further defended the play, [...] "The comments we made on the compromises demanded by success, {{as well as some of}} the satiric side issues—hypochondria, the empty cocktail party—still hold." ...|$|E

John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode took the promising {{beginning of the}} last episode and delivered a strong and surprising larger meaning to {{the pieces of the}} mythology we’ve seen over the past few seasons. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… those who bash these episodes simply because they relate to the “new direction” ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> themselves. With this kind of creativity, this series could easily end {{in a way that makes}} the entire series one seamless tapestry." [...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Providence", along with the previous episode [...] "Provenance", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E
500|$|Rudolph Schnaubelt (1863–1901) was {{an activist}} and the brother-in law of Michael Schwab. He {{was at the}} Haymarket when the bomb exploded. Schnaubelt was indicted with the other {{defendants}} but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial. He was the detectives' lead suspect, and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb, identifying him from a photograph in court. Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility, writing, [...] "If I had really thrown this bomb, surely I would have nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of,</b> but in [...] truth I never once thought of it." [...] He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in The Bomb, Frank Harris's 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy. Written from Schnaubelt's point of view, the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed. However, Harris's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, he ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> himself ...

500|$|The {{following}} pages are chiefly {{designed for the}} use of those who have no previous knowledge of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament; but since the Author has endeavoured to embody in them the results of very recent investigations, he hopes that they may prove of service to more advanced students. He asks the reader's indulgence for the annexed list of Addenda et Corrigenda, both by reason of the peculiar character of his work, and the remoteness of West Cornwall from Public Libraries. He might easily have suppressed the greater part of them, but that he has honestly tried to be accurate, and sees no cause <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> what Person has well called [...] "the common lot of authorship." [...] He has only to add that he has not consciously borrowed from other writers without due acknowledgement, and to return his best thanks to the Rev. H. O. Coxe for important aid in the Bodleian, and to Henry Bradshaw Esq., Fellow of King's College, for valuable instruction respecting manuscripts in the University Library at Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|In Europe {{there were}} {{typically}} two meals a day: dinner at mid-day and a lighter supper in the evening. The two-meal system remained consistent throughout the late Middle Ages. Smaller intermediate meals were common, but became {{a matter of}} social status, as {{those who did not}} have to perform manual labor could go without them. Moralists frowned on breaking the overnight fast too early, and members of the church and cultivated gentry avoided it. For practical reasons, breakfast was still eaten by working men, and was tolerated for young children, women, the elderly and the sick. Because the church preached against gluttony and other weaknesses of the flesh, men tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> the weak practicality of breakfast. Lavish dinner banquets and late-night reresopers (from Occitan rèire-sopar, [...] "late supper") with considerable amounts of alcoholic beverage were considered immoral. The latter were especially associated with gambling, crude language, drunkenness, and lewd behavior. Minor meals and snacks were common (although also disliked by the church), and working men commonly received an allowance from their employers in order to buy nuncheons, small morsels to be eaten during breaks.|$|E
500|$|Kvinneakt {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s. In addition to being somewhat controversial because it is a nude, the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art. In 1981, Taylor recalled that following the sculpture's first installation one man told him that [...] "he ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> himself." [...] In 1985, Jeff Kuechle of The Oregonian listed the work as one of the city's [...] "worst sculptures". In the article, Claire Kelly, director of Portland State University's art and architecture program said, [...] "She's more than simplistic, she's absurd. It's not a piece that belongs on public display." [...] In contrast, Monk Magazine described the sculpture as [...] "the best-looking girl in Portland" [...] with [...] "her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure". [...] According to the magazine, Portland is the only city in the United States with a [...] "flasher statue". [...] The sculpture was included in Kate Chynoweth's 2003 book, The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest: A Romantic Travel Guide, as one of Portland's [...] "romantic highlights".|$|E

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of,</b> her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
