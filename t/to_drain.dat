In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time runs out.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> an {{area between}} Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now loses its flow to {{underground}} mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles. The waters of Black Creek are acidic.|$|E

40|$|Osteopontin (OPN) is a {{chemotactic}} {{protein that}} attracts immune cells, to inflammatory sites. The sensitization phase of allergic cutaneous contact hypersensitivity (CHS) requires {{the migration of}} Langerhans cells/dendritic cells (LCs/DCs) from skin <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes. Characterizing OPN function for LC/DC migration we found upregulated OPN expression in hapten sensitized skin and draining lymph nodes. OPN induces chemotactic LC/DC migration, initiates their emigration from the epidermis, and attracts LCs/DCs <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes by interacting with CD 44 and �v integrin. Furthermore, OPN-deficient mice have a significantly reduced CHS response that correlates with an impaired ability of OPN-deficient mice to attract LCs/DCs <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes. In conclusion, OPN {{is an important factor}} in the initiation of CHS by guiding LCs/DCs from skin into lymphatic organs.

5|$|Conditions in Yosemite Valley {{and access}} to the park {{steadily}} improved. In 1878, Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> a swamp behind it. Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were insufficient <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main grandstand was built.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond– {{have been created}} <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the case}} of kelpies and water horses, most myths about water bulls are about males of the species. Occasionally a water cow is mentioned, as in the Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where a water cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine {{carcases}} left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to a water cow in a story about an attempt <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the same vein of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write Me Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E

50|$|A {{sanitary}} tee has {{a curved}} center section. In drainage systems, {{it is primarily}} used <b>to</b> connect horizontal <b>drains</b> (including fixture trap arms) <b>to</b> vertical <b>drains.</b> The center connection is generally to the pipe leading to a trap (the trap arm). It must not connect a vertical <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> a horizontal <b>drain,</b> because of the likelihood that solids will accumulate {{at the bottom of}} the junction and cause a blockage.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} 150 years New Zealand has lost about 90% of its wetland areas due <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> for farming. Many {{remaining}} wetlands are also degraded due to pollution, grazing, drainage and presence of invasive plants.|$|R
5|$|Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is {{a complex}} of {{waterways}} between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames. Starting in the twelfth century, works were carried out <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> Stratford Marshes {{and several of the}} waterways were constructed to power watermills. Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames, and the other channels were called Abbey Creek, Channelsea River, City Mill River, Prescott Channel, Pudding Mill River, Saint Thomas Creek, Three Mills Back River, Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River.|$|E
5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E

5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
50|$|John Smith in 1895 {{records the}} remains of an old lade , which {{supplied}} water to drive a wheel wherewith the old coal-pits used <b>to</b> be <b>drained.</b> This was an early example {{of the use of}} water-gins (water-wheels) <b>to</b> help <b>drain</b> mines.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of aquifers is often anisotropic {{for the same}} reason.

40|$|Classification of cytokines as pro-versus {{anti-inflammatory}} {{might not}} apply to the pleiotropic effects of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10). Several reports suggest that IL- 10 enhances the function of natural killer cells, which leads, through pathogen destruction, to increased antigen availability. In addition, by inhibiting the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), IL- 10 preserves their ability for antigen uptake while simultaneously hampering their migration <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes. This review suggests that this 'antigen-loading' phase might constitute {{an important component of the}} innate immune reaction to a pathogen. Additional proinflammatory stimuli might subsequently lead to maturation of 'loaded' APCs that could migrate <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes or recruit and activate adaptive immune effectors locally...|$|R
5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube was inserted <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly {{parallel to the}} River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
40|$|Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are {{essential}} to suppress unwanted immunity or inflammation. After islet allo-transplant Tregs must migrate from blood to allograft, then via afferent lymphatics <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> LN <b>to</b> protect allografts. Here we show that Tregs but not non-Treg T cells use lymphotoxin (LT) during migration from allograft <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> LN, and that LT deficiency or blockade prevents normal migration and allograft protection. Treg LTαβ rapidly modulates cytoskeletal and membrane structure of lymphatic endothelial cells; dependent on VCAM- 1 and non-canonical NFκB signalling via LTβR. These results demonstrate a form of T-cell migration used only by Treg in tissues that serves {{an important role in}} their suppressive function and is a unique therapeutic focus for modulating suppression...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that ILC 3 s reside within the interfollicular areas of mucosal draining lymph nodes, forming a distinct microenvironment not observed in peripheral lymph nodes. By photoconverting intestinal cells in Kaede mice we reveal constitutive trafficking of ILCs from the intestine <b>to</b> the <b>draining</b> mesenteric lymph nodes, which specifically for the LTi-like ILC 3 s was ​CCR 7 -dependent. Thus, ILC populations traffic <b>to</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes using different mechanisms...|$|R
