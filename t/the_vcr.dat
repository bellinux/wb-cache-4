5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

25|$|A {{closely related}} service is the Video Program System (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical blanking interval. It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes <b>the</b> <b>VCR.</b> VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|E
50|$|VHS-C {{cassette}} {{was larger}} than Video8 cassette, but was compatible with VHS tape recorders, using a special adapter cassette. The adapter contains a standard full-size engagement hub for <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> takeup sprocket, which connected to a gear train to drive the VHS-C cassette takeup gear.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>VCR's</b> ubiquity was {{responsible}} for making consumers familiar with RF modulation, which could explain its lasting popularity and use in all-digital media like DVD and video game consoles. A better explanation might be its familiarity and ease of use, along with legacy televisions, which could not readily support newer technologies like composite or S-video.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, some {{high-end}} VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) {{both on the}} cassette and in <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).|$|R
25|$|The company's rise to {{prominence}} {{was fueled by}} the industry switch from film to videotape. In the late 1970s a feature-length porn film shot on celluloid might have {{cost as much as}} $350,000. In 1983 <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> had been recently introduced, and producers were beginning to make pornographic films on videotape. A film using video could be made for as little as $5,000, compared to a minimum of $40,000 for a movie shot on film. Into the 1990s, by shooting its productions with video cameras, Evil Angel could still make films for $8,000. Stagliano initially had little knowledge of film making, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983: Bouncing Buns, starring Stacy Donovan. For the next six years he made films for other companies to manufacture and distribute.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercial}} {{viability of the}} sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decline in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977—that year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely. In succeeding years, the popularization of <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> and the expansion of movieviewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters. While Rocky Horror soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like The Warriors (1979), The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980), The Evil Dead (1981), Heavy Metal (1981), and Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982)—all from mainstream distributors—were picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. By the time the fabled Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shut its doors after a fire in 1986, the days of the theatrical midnight movie as a significant countercultural phenomenon were already past.|$|E
500|$|... "Spotlight" [...] was {{featured}} {{in the last of}} a series of Japanese TV commercials Madonna filmed for electronics company Mitsubishi. The commercial promoted their VCR model F-5.3. In the commercial, Madonna {{was featured}} as coming out of a car and sitting down on a sofa, while watching a film on <b>the</b> <b>VCR,</b> as [...] "Spotlight" [...] is played in the background. The song was also used as cross-promotion for the Japanese leg of her 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour under the campaign name of [...] "Dreams Come True".|$|E
50|$|The {{videocassette}} recorder {{remained in}} home use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, despite {{the advent of}} competing technologies such as LaserDisc (LD) and Video CD (VCD). While Laserdisc offered higher quality video and audio, the discs are heavy (weighing about one pound each), cumbersome, much more prone to damage if dropped or mishandled, and furthermore only home LD players, not recorders, were available. The VCD format found a niche with Asian film imports, but did not sell widely. Many Hollywood studios did not release feature films on VCD in North America because the VCD format had no means of preventing perfect copies being made on CD-R discs, which were already popular when the format was introduced. In an attempt to lower costs, manufacturers began dropping nonessential features from their <b>VCR</b> models. <b>The</b> built-in display was dropped in favor of on screen display for setup, programming, and status, and many buttons were eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> front panel, their functions accessible only from <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> remote control.|$|R
5000|$|Most stereo-capable video {{recorders}} made through the 1980s and early 1990s had a [...] "simulcast" [...] recording mode where they recorded video {{signals from the}} built-in TV tuner and audio signals from <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> audio line-in connectors. This was to allow one to connect a stereo FM tuner that is tuned to the simulcast frequency to <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> audio input in order to record the stereo sound of a TV program {{that would otherwise be}} recorded in mono. The function was primarily necessary with stereo VCRs that didn't have a stereo TV tuner or were operated in areas where stereo TV broadcasting wasn't in place. This was typically selected through the user setting the input selector to [...] "Simulcast" [...] or [...] "Radio" [...] mode or, in the case of some JVC units, the user setting another [...] "audio input" [...] switch from [...] "TV" [...] or [...] "Tuner" [...] to [...] "Line".|$|R

500|$|Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh. When {{creating}} the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women {{were expected to}} behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite. Wasikowska read Carroll's books {{as a child and}} re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched Jan Švankmajer's Alice. She said, [...] "When we were kids, my mum would pop it in <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> player. We would be disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. So I had kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling." [...] Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as [...] "stubborn, brave, [...] non-girlie".|$|E
500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment {{at the back of}} the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{destroying}} film studios, videotape sales {{became increasingly}} {{important to their}} revenue. The press discussed <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> [...] "and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out {{for a couple of}} bucks the movie you want to see when you want to see it". Film studios opened new divisions to produce prerecorded tapes, and by 1985 their sales were about the same as box office revenue; the Associated Press reported that [...] "because of <b>the</b> <b>VCR,</b> even a bad movie can make money". Although <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> received blame for a 25% decline in the summer 1985 box office compared to 1984's, and closing movie theaters, by 1987 it was credited with causing a record-high box office, as videotapes' popularity encouraged consumers' interest in films and watching them in theaters. Cable movie channels worried about VCRs affecting subscriptions, but began to offer more films for owners who wanted to build a home library, even encouraging time shifting by broadcasting the movies during the night so VCRs could record them while their owners slept.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 Sony {{purchased}} Columbia Pictures {{and became}} owner {{of its own}} Hollywood studio.

Forbes wrote in 2001 that <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> was no longer [...] "arguably believed to be the death knell of the movie business.

[...] Despite Valenti's prediction, the home video market ultimately came to be the mainstay of movie studio revenues throughout the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

However, when he approaches the scientific community with his discovery, he is ridiculed. Determined to prove his colleagues wrong, Hawkins builds a space station, the Jim Dandy, and bribes aboard his laboratory janitor, Kurt Hectic, by means of Hungarian goulash. He then launches the station into orbit, projecting that the mission will last five days. However, after a week, Hawkins realizes Flange Orbits do not actually exist, but rather than return to Earth in shame, he decides to remain on the Dandy to try to discover something, anticipating another week in space. Kurt is extremely unhappy with this development, but once Hawkins shows him how to program <b>the</b> <b>VCR,</b> he calms down.|$|E

After the hostage drama has been resolved and the robber arrested the family remembers there's a bomb in <b>the</b> <b>VCR,</b> but they don't know how to re-program it. Betty observes that [...] "this is just like E Street... at the end, where they all got blown up", but Greg responds that [...] "That doesn't happen in sitcoms."

5000|$|An {{example of}} interpassivity, given by Žižek, {{in his book}} [...] "How To Read Lacan," [...] uses <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> to {{illustrate}} the concept. <b>The</b> <b>VCR</b> records a movie (presumably to be watched later). However, Žižek argues that since <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> can record, people who own them watch less movies because they can record them and have them on hand. <b>The</b> <b>VCR</b> does the watching of the movie so the owner of <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> can be free not to watch the movie. Žižek uses <b>the</b> <b>VCR</b> to demonstrate the big Other's role in interpassivity. <b>The</b> <b>VCR,</b> like canned laughter in a show, functions as a tool interacting with itself so the viewer can not watch the show.|$|E
50|$|The {{control track}} {{is also used}} to hold index marks, which were {{normally}} written {{at the beginning of each}} recording session, and can be found using <b>the</b> <b>VCR's</b> index search function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program — but this feature later became hard to find.|$|R
