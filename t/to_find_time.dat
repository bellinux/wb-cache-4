Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are too busy working <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time.</b> They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} three seasons Foster could spare no time for cricket, apart from August 1905 (when he scored 246 on his first appearance), but in 1907 he was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to play regularly {{from the beginning of}} June. His batting was as good as ever in a summer of appalling wickets and helped Worcestershire (fourteenth of sixteen counties in 1906) to rise to equal second with Yorkshire. He captained England in the three-match series against South Africa in 1907, winning one match and drawing two. Offered the captaincy of the MCC for the 1907/1908 Ashes tour, Foster declined because business commitments were monopolising his attention.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

25|$|The {{training}} of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence {{and in front of}} a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination. This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.|$|E

[...] He felt {{the presentation of}} the modules was done well, with easily read maps, although he preferred the black and white maps of the first module to the blue and white maps of the later two. Turnbull found the module's level of detail to be an improvement over previous Dungeons & Dragons scenarios which gave the Dungeon Master (DM) too little information. The review declared the modules [...] "very tough", stating that [...] "the notes suggest nine characters or so, each of ninth level or better and each with two or three relevant magic items." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 7, 2010, Uematsu {{announced}} the band had formally disbanded. He {{did not directly}} state {{the reason for the}} decision, though in previous interviews he had noted the band was increasingly finding it difficult <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to rehearse together. In an April 2011 interview he said the main reason was because The Black Mages had been formed as a [...] "Square Enix" [...] band, they were unable to perform arrangements of work he had composed after leaving Square Enix or to focus on original pieces. Uematsu continues to play rock arrangements of his music {{as a part of the}} band the Earthbound Papas, which performed at the Distant Worlds II concert in 2010. He has been joined by fellow Black Mages bandmates Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda, both continuing on guitar and drums, respectively. They had also left Square Enix; Uematsu built the new band to not include any current Square Enix employees so as to avoid the trademark and licensing problems of The Black Mages.|$|E
500|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{commentaries on}} I Corinthians (1551), Romans (1558), and Judges (1561) during his lifetime. He was criticized by {{his colleagues in}} Strasbourg for withholding his lectures on books of the Bible for years rather than sending them to be published. Calling his lecture notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and the Minor Prophets [...] "brief and hasty annotations", he found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> {{to prepare them for}} publication. His colleagues edited and published some of his remaining works on the Bible after his death: prayers on the Psalms (1564) and commentaries on Kings (1566), Genesis (1569), and Lamentations (1629). Vermigli followed the humanist emphasis on seeking the original meaning of scripture, as opposed to the often fanciful and arbitrary allegorical readings of the medieval exegetical tradition. He occasionally adopted an allegorical reading to interpret the Old Testament as having to do with Christ typologically, but he did not utilize the quadriga method of medieval biblical interpretation, where each passage has four levels of meaning. Vermigli's command of Hebrew, as well as his knowledge of rabbinic literature, surpassed that of most of his contemporaries, including Calvin, Luther, and Zwingli.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Selena's third studio album Entre a Mi Mundo and the launch of a {{clothing}} boutique in 1993, the singer and her band began working on Amor Prohibido. Having achieved the success and the fan base that EMI Latin's president Jose Behar was seeking, {{he wanted to take}} advantage of [...] "newly discovered markets". The singer's brother, A.B. Quintanilla, felt it was important that the music he produced for Selena remain [...] "fresh". EMI Latin had insisted on a Grammy Award-winning producer to work with Selena on the album. A.B. later told BuzzFeed how he had to [...] "outdo" [...] himself to remain her principal record producer. Owing to Entre a Mi Mundos commercial success, and its career-launching single [...] "Como la Flor", A.B. found it [...] "difficult" [...] to produce another successful recording. In a 2002 interview he said that writing [...] "a part two" [...] to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] was infeasible so he enlisted Selena y Los Dinos band members Pete Astudillo and Ricky Vela to help with the album's writing process. The result was a [...] "more mature sound [...] " [...] that included experimental recording and production. It was the final album with any production and songwriting assistance by Astudillo, as he parted with Los Dinos to pursue a solo career. The entire production of Amor Prohibido lasted six months beginning on September 17, 1993. It took two weeks for the band to complete its post-production before the album was given a street date of March 13, 1994. Vela noticed the band was becoming stagnant and had to rush the production because of an approaching deadline. Selena's husband and guitarist Chris Pérez, wrote that the constant touring demands and the opening of the boutiques depleted time spent creating Amor Prohibido, saying [...] "I don't even know how we managed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>time</b> to make the next album." [...] Vela {{said in an interview that}} it was common for the band to arrange the sequencing of the entire project in their homes before going into the studio to record the songs.|$|E
