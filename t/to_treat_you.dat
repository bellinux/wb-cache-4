Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>you</b> so bad. You don't {{have to take it}} so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One of Us Must Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E

It started with Lee Kuan Yew (PAP) who said [...] "We {{want to have a}} First World parliament for Singapore, so {{we need to have a}} First World government and a First World opposition. If you want us <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>you</b> as gentlemen, argue on the merits of your policy and our policy. Take it to a higher level and we will treat you accordingly and respond accordingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the chains}} of St. Peter," [...] quoth the monk, [...] "that {{is just what}} thou needest. Hoist thee on such another fool's back, truss thee up, and lay it on lustily, till thou art ashamed. <b>To</b> <b>treat</b> <b>thee</b> as a man is only to make thee a more heady blown-up ass than thou art already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There may be reasons which thou knowest not, why I wear a mask. But if my face be hid {{the limbs}} are bare, and thou seest {{there is no}} lack of sinews to make good that which I have undertaken. Thou should'st have thought better of the matter ere thou puttest thyself {{in the way of}} so much mortification. Defeat will not cause the people <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>thee</b> more tenderly." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a Playboy interview, Ventura said, [...] "Organized {{religion}} is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people {{to go out and}} stick their noses in other people's business. I live by the golden rule: Treat others as you'd want them <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>you.</b> The religious right wants to tell people how to live." [...] In his 1999 best-selling memoir I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{anything}} <b>you</b> said with scorn," [...] replied Sybil in a subdued tone. [...] "Many things happened yesterday," [...] she added, [...] "which might be offered as some excuse for an unguarded word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he rejoined--I won't say curtly, {{but with}} businesslike brevity, [...] "for all {{purposes}} {{connected with the}} affair which I desire <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> with <b>you</b> my name, {{as far as you}} are concerned, shall be Jean Duval. Understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am {{not angry}} with you," [...] he said, quite emphatically. [...] "I am very glad indeed that you came. It is only right that I should help you when my people seem <b>to</b> have <b>treated</b> <b>you</b> so wretchedly. Let me {{think for a}} moment." ...|$|R

60|$|There is no use beating {{about the}} bush with a man like you. I know that. You are direct, and so am I. You know my {{position}} well enough to be assured that I am empowered <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> with <b>you.</b>|$|R

50|$|In his autobiography, {{reflecting}} on the experience, he writes, “I learned a lesson with regard to race that I never forgot: how people feel about you reflects the way you permit yourself <b>to</b> be <b>treated.</b> If <b>you</b> permit yourself <b>to</b> be <b>treated</b> differently, <b>you</b> are condemned to an unequal relationship.” The same year Patterson received his Doctorate from Iowa State College in 1923, Jack Trice, the College's first African American student athlete, died from injuries sustained in a football game.|$|R

6000|$|... "Go in peace, Chief," [...] he said; [...] "they seem <b>to</b> have <b>treated</b> <b>you</b> roughly up yonder.

6000|$|... "Captain," [...] I {{once said}} to him, {{appealing}} to his patriotism, which was of a hardy quality, [...] "this is no way <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> American seamen. <b>You</b> don't call it American <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> men like dogs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he said slowly, [...] "that I am {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> with <b>you</b> any longer.
