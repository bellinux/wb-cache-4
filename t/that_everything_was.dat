A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

25|$|The English {{localization}} {{was led by}} Adam Lensenmayer, who was {{the sole}} translator for the project; this was to ensure consistency in {{the feeling of the}} story and in the characters' voices. The localization was done over the course of five months, something Lensenmayer noted as a big project. It was also a challenging one: its use of real-world science meant that the localization team had to research subjects like artificial intelligence, cognitive science and time travel theories to ensure <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> phrased correctly. Another challenge was that Steins;Gate 0 was written specifically for a Japanese audience, who might understand certain things that Western players would not, although Lensenmayer said that this was a smaller problem than it had been with the first Steins;Gate, due to Steins;Gate 0 more serious tone and lesser focus on otaku and internet culture, and its built-in dictionary which explains obscure concepts.|$|E
25|$|During one {{of these}} sorties Robert Redhead a sutler had {{captured}} two very important Spanish prisoners; Cosimo d'Alexandrini and Pedro de Lugo a Commissary of the artillery. They had been captured {{not far from the}} North Fort by an English scouting party, Redhead was looking for items to sell to the troops inside when he stumbled across the Spanish officers checking the strength of the walls. The North Fort was a strong fortress which secured the entrance to Bergen op Zoom from the Scheldt on the north-east side. The two Spanish stayed as guests at the Lieutenant of the garrison's house belonging to William Grimstone and large bribes were offered to allow the Spanish into the North Gate. It was hoped that this would {{fall into the hands of}} Parma thus making the capture of Bergen a lot easier. Willoughby soon discovered this and by his orders pretended to give a ready consent to the proposal. As a ruse Grimstone pretended he was a staunch Catholic and were supporters of William Stanley the English turncoat. They secretly left the camp provided with letters from the two Spaniards to the Duke of Parma informing <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> prepared for the admittance of the besiegers into the fort. On 6 October they soon met with Parma and were in conference - Parma obliged them to take an oath on the Sacrament that they were acting in good faith. Once this was done he gave them a large gold chain and promised a large sum of money in the event of success.|$|E

5000|$|To illustrate, {{cosmologist}} Max Tegmark argues boldly {{that the}} universe consists of math: [...] "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," [...] then the idea <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> mathematical [...] "starts to sound {{a little bit less}} insane." [...] Tegmark moves from the epistemic claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the methodological claim <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ontological claim, <b>that</b> ultimately <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> exists <b>is</b> mathematical (the mathematical universe hypothesis). The argument is then reversed, so <b>that</b> because <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> mathematical in reality, mathematics is necessarily the ultimate universal symbol system.|$|R
25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. Rob then sent a visiting order to Robert. He told him about Tracy wanting to start a new relationship with him. Robert was disgusted and stormed out. He then split up with Tracy. Rob reveals to Tracy <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> a lie and that he still hated her. Johnny reveals all to a disgusted Carla.

Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit under wraps. She also begins bonding with Kate. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, but changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the bistro to confront him. Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows. However, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton), and his friend, Lee, burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious. She survived and Tracy pressures her to persuade Nick to sell the Bistro. He eventually sells to Robert, and Carla and Nick make plans to move to Devon.|$|E
