5|$|President Thomas Jefferson and his Republican party opposed {{a strong}} navy, arguing that small gunboats {{in the major}} harbors were all the nation needed <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself.</b> They proved useless in wartime.|$|E
5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, {{they were}} unwilling to further weaken {{the ability of the}} U.S. <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> through the scattering of the all-important battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out with Japan. For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E
5|$|Mexico {{launched}} {{two small}} expeditions into Texas in 1842. The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in {{battle in the}} Dawson massacre. Despite these successes, Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas, and the republic survived. The republic's inability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> added momentum to Texas's eventual annexation into the United States.|$|E
25|$|Unable <b>to</b> {{consistently}} <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> {{against the}} AFRC/RUF rebels, the Kabbah regime {{was forced to}} make serious concessions in the Lome Peace Agreement of July 1999.|$|R

50|$|It {{is quick}} <b>to</b> vigorously <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> by {{striking}} repeatedly and flattening its head {{making it look}} like a cottonmouth.Which is why it's commonly mistaken for a venomous snake.|$|R
5|$|The geranium, for example, {{produces}} a unique chemical compound in its petals <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> from Japanese beetles. Within 30 minutes of ingestion the chemical paralyzes the herbivore. While the chemical usually wears off {{within a few}} hours, during this time the beetle is often consumed by its own predators.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, both sides {{were aware of the}} {{possibility}} of a political collapse. If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe {{would have been able to}} strike anywhere in southern England and with the prospect of an invasion, the British government would have come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever happened in the air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|In November 2015, the {{government}} of Quebec sued Canadian Pacific Railway alleging it was negligent in transferring the oil train to the Montreal, Maine, and Atlantic and that it failed to take precautions that would have prevented the disaster. “CP intends <b>to</b> fully <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> in court,” was the company's response.|$|R
50|$|Some Japanese {{people have}} stated {{a desire to}} have their own {{military}} due to fear of the growing power of China and the hostility of North Korea. They claim that the U.S. has failed to properly address these issues, and Japan must grant itself the means <b>to</b> adequately <b>defend</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A fast attack craft's main {{advantage}} over other warship types is its affordability. Many FACs can be deployed {{at a relatively}} low cost, allowing a navy which is at a disadvantage <b>to</b> effectively <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against a larger adversary. [...] A small boat, when equipped with the same weapons as its larger counterpart, can pose {{a serious threat to}} even the largest of capital ships. Their major disadvantages are poor seagoing qualities, cramped quarters and poor ability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> themselves against aerial threat.|$|R
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. <b>To</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Hürtgen Forest {{began on}} 19 September, with the assault of the 3rd Armored and 9th Infantry Divisions. The battle quickly turned {{into one of}} attrition; by mid-October the two Allied {{divisions}} had lost nearly 80% of their total combat strength, or roughly 4,500 men, while the Germans had lost close to 3,300. On 2 November the U.S. 28th Infantry Division entered the fight, but {{was not able to}} make headway and was forced <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against German counterattacks between 5–7 November. The 28th Infantry Division lost over 6,100 combat casualties in Hürtgen.|$|E
5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
50|$|The {{occupation}} of al-Faw placed the city Basra {{at risk of}} being attacked, rumors of a final Iranian offensive against Basra proliferated. <b>To</b> help <b>defend</b> <b>itself,</b> Iraq had built impressive fortifications and Iraq devoted particular attention to the southern city of Basra. It built concrete-roofed bunkers, tank- and artillery-firing positions, minefields, and stretches of barbed wire, all shielded by an artificially flooded lake 30 kilometers long and 1,800 meters wide.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the general}} harassing by the Lakota of Fort Buford lasted {{until the early}} 1870s, the worst was during that first year, June 1866 to May 1867. In May, the Missouri River thawed {{allowing}} the sternwheeler steamboat Graham to reinforce the garrison with additional riverboats arriving in June carrying Companies B, F, G, and part of E thereby enabling the garrison <b>to</b> better <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> and allow for more permanent structures to be built.|$|R
50|$|And so, men freely {{declare that}} the Scotch wars {{had been brought}} to their close, that nothing {{remained}} of the Scotch nation that was willing or able <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> or govern <b>itself.</b> Yet they were wrong as the sequel showed.|$|R
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself,</b> as for example in honey badgers.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. MacLachlan's {{squadron}} {{moved to}} France on 2 September, and Britain and her allies declared war the following day. 88 Squadron formed {{part of the}} RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) commanded by Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair. On 12 September 1939 88 Squadron was based southeast of Rheims. At this time the Luftwaffe was heavily engaged in Poland {{and only a few}} small-scale skirmishes were fought with a thin German fighter screen left to guard western Germany against a French attack. On 20 September elements of the squadron were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) over the border. Four Fairey Battle aircraft were shot down. On 30 September 150 Squadron lost five Battles on unescorted missions into German airspace. It quickly became clear to the crews that the Battle was too slow and too poorly armed <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> and operations were shut down. The squadron took measures to increase its defensive power by adding a third machine gun {{in the back of the}} cockpit for the observer to use.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1813-1814 {{with the}} line {{infantry}} troops, we also see the Landwehr, which served as reserve troops <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Prussia <b>itself.</b> It was independent in organisation and had its own units and its own officers. In the Kreise (districts), commissions organised troops in which the bourgeois could become officers. The reformers' idea of unifying {{the people and the}} army seems to have succeeded. Volunteer chasseur detachments (freiwillige Jägerdetachements) were also formed as reinforcements.|$|R
5000|$|... "Freedom {{without the}} {{strength}} to support it and, if need be, defend it, would be a cruel delusion. And the strength <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> freedom can <b>itself</b> only come from widespread industrialisation and the infusion of modern science and technology into the country's economic life." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{public mind}} was alarmed and apprehensive, though {{fortunately}} not distracted or disheartened. It {{seemed to be}} doubtful whether the Federal Government, which one year before had been thought a model worthy of universal acceptance, had indeed the ability <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> and maintain <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5|$|On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked {{access to}} the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not {{negotiated}} a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.|$|E

5000|$|The town of Barcelonnette {{was founded}} in 1231 by Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal [...] "foundation", {{according}} certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of Barcilona. The town was afforded a consulat (giving it the power <b>to</b> administer and <b>defend</b> <b>itself)</b> in 1240.|$|R
50|$|The Cimmerians are {{consistent}} of various warlike tribes. They engage in war {{with each other}} when not actively and stubbornly defending their territory from the raids and military invasions of their neighbors. They are fiercely independent and resist all attempts at conquest. They perform raids to the realms of others but are either unable or uninterested in expanding their territories. Aquilonia manages <b>to</b> successfully <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> from the raids and their efforts to expand in Cimmerian grounds meet with fierce opposition. These borders remain surprisingly stable after centuries of warfare.|$|R
50|$|In the Pacific theater, CVEs {{provided}} {{air support}} of ground {{troops in the}} Battle of Leyte Gulf. They lacked the speed and weapons to counter enemy fleets, relying on the protection of a Fast Carrier Task Force. However, at the Battle off Samar, one U.S. task force of escort carriers managed <b>to</b> successfully <b>defend</b> <b>itself</b> against a much larger Japanese force of battleships and cruisers. The Japanese met a furious defense of carrier aircraft, screening destroyers, and destroyer escorts, proving that CVEs could appear {{to have the same}} striking power as full CVs.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the governments}} of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Netherlands {{expressed}} support for Israel's right <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself,</b> and/or condemned the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel.|$|E

25|$|The {{toxicology}} of red imported {{fire ant}} venom {{has been extensively}} studied. The venom {{is important to the}} ant, enabling it to capture its prey and <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>itself.</b> Some 14 million people are bitten annually in the United States, suffering reactions including sensitivity and anaphylactic shock. The venom contains some 46 proteins of which four are allergens.|$|E
5000|$|The name Krajina (meaning [...] "frontier") {{stemmed from}} the Military Frontier which Austria carved out of parts of the crown lands of Croatia and Slavonia between 1553-1578 with a view <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> <b>itself</b> against the {{expansion}} of the Ottoman Empire. Many Croats, Serbs and Vlachs immigrated from nearby parts of the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia) into the region and helped bolster and replenish the population as well as the garrisoned troops in the fight against the Ottomans. The Austrians controlled the Frontier from military headquarters in Vienna and did not make it a crown land, though it had some special rights in order to encourage settlement in an otherwise deserted, war-ravaged territory. The abolition of military rule took place between 1869 and 1871. In order to attract Serbs to become part of Croatia, on 11 May 1867, the Sabor solemnly declared that [...] "the Triune Kingdom recognizes the Serbian/Vlach people living in it as a nation identical and equal with the Croatian nation". Subsequently, the Military Frontier was incorporated into Habsburg Croatia in 1881.|$|R
50|$|Their advance through Pannonia {{until the}} Julian Alps was unopposed, and Theodosius and his {{officers}} {{must have had}} suspicions about what lay ahead when they discovered that the eastern ends of the mountain passes were undefended. Arbogast had, based on his experiences fighting against the usurper Magnus Maximus in Gaul, decided that the best strategy was to keep his forces united <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Italy <b>itself,</b> and <b>to</b> that end he {{went so far as}} to leave the Alpine passes unguarded. Arbogast's forces consisted mainly of his fellow Franks and Gallo-Romans, plus his own Gothic auxiliaries.|$|R
5000|$|In early September, the {{division}} absorbed {{what was left}} of the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49 and SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51, raising its infantry strength. However, replacements for missing tanks and assault guns arrived slowly. On September 8, {{the division}} was put back into the line and was tasked with destroying the newly formed bridgehead over the Moselle River held by the US 5th and 80th Infantry Divisions. After heavy fighting for the American bridgeheads at Dornot and Arnaville, the division fell back and began <b>to</b> prepare <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Metz <b>itself.</b>|$|R
