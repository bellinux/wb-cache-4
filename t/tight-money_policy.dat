5000|$|The 1981 {{recession}} {{is thought to}} have been caused by the <b>tight-money</b> <b>policy</b> adopted by Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before Ronald Reagan took office. Reagan supported that policy. Economist Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s, said that [...] "I call it a Reagan-Volcker-Carter recession. The resulting taming of inflation did, however, {{set the stage for a}} robust growth period during Reagan's administration.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Burns, Nixons {{appointee}} {{to chair}} the Federal Reserve, {{shifted away from}} a <b>tight-money</b> <b>policy</b> because the nation’s unemployment was sharply rising as was inflation. In {{the early months of}} 1971, Nixon started criticizing the growing wages in the steel industry, so he created the Tripartite Committee to keep a closer watch on the construction industry. Treasury Secretary John Connally announced that the government would need to start taking new measures. Despite this, unemployment had reached 6 percent.|$|E
50|$|In addition, late in 1995 Yeltsin {{dismissed}} Anatoly Chubais, one of {{the last}} economic reform advocates remaining in a top Government position, as deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy. In place of Chubais, Yeltsin named Vladimir Kadannikov, a former automobile plant manager whose views were antireform. This move raised concerns in Russia and the West about Yeltsin's commitment to economic reform. Another casualty of the political atmosphere was RCB chairman Paramonova, whose nomination had remained a source of controversy between the State Duma and the Government. In November 1995, Yeltsin was forced to replace her with Sergey Dubinin, a Chernomyrdin protégé who continued the <b>tight-money</b> <b>policy</b> that Paramonova had established.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we reconsider {{the link between}} tight money {{policies}} and inflation {{in the spirit of}} Sargent and Wallace's (1981) influential paper, "Some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic. " A standard neoclassical model with capital, bonds, and return-dominated currency is used. The potential for <b>tight-money</b> <b>policies</b> to be inflationary (unpleasant arithmetic) exists, even when the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy. Additionally, the likely observability of unpleasant arithmetic in real world economies is shown to depend crucially on the type of monetary policy rule that is used. ...|$|R
5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed <b>tight-money</b> monetary <b>policies</b> which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|R
