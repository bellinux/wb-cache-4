5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to <b>think</b> <b>clearly.</b> Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|Using {{a compass}} in Greenland {{involves}} accounting {{for a very}} extreme magnetic declination. Failure to calculate correctly can send a hunter in the wrong direction, leading to complete loss of bearings. Getting lost in bad weather can waste precious time, forcing the hunter to overnight in very wet, cold, and unpleasant conditions. Hypothermia can further complicate matters and decrease the hunter's ability to <b>think</b> <b>clearly,</b> causing them to lose their bearings even more. A fight for survival may then ensue. Deaths are relatively rare, but they do happen.|$|E

25|$|Rutledge {{also argued}} that if either house of the {{legislature}} {{was to have the}} sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, it should be the Senate. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded {{that there would be no}} danger of the Senate ruling the country.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|Benny— Benny {{has been}} the most heavily altered from the {{original}} novel. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the novel, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psycho-drama places him in stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of them will be sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating— but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> again - then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates the compassion he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead.|$|E

According to Scripps, [...] "the paramount obligation of a college is to develop in its students the ability to <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> and independently, {{and the ability to}} live confidently, courageously, and hopefully". Soon after its founding, in 1927 the first dormitory was dedicated in memory of trustee Eleanor Joy Toll.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 November, Nanavati {{returned}} home {{from one of his}} assignments and finding Sylvia aloof and distant, he questioned her. Sylvia, who now doubted Prem's intention to marry her, confessed about the affair to her husband. Nanavati dropped his family at the Metro Cinema, for a show he had promised to take them to, but excused himself and headed straight to confront Prem Ahuja. When Sylvia was asked in court, why she went to the theatre, leaving her agitated husband behind, she answered, [...] "I was upset myself and I did not <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> then.

2500|$|Although [...] "severely {{elevated}} mood" [...] sounds somewhat {{desirable and}} enjoyable, {{the experience of}} mania is ultimately often quite unpleasant and sometimes disturbing, if not frightening, for the person involved and for those close to them, and it may lead to impulsive behaviour that may later be regretted. [...] It can also often be complicated by the sufferer's lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of characteristic states. [...] Manic patients are frequently grandiose, obsessive, impulsive, irritable, belligerent, and frequently deny anything is wrong with them. [...] Because mania frequently encourages high energy and decreased perception of need or ability to sleep, {{within a few days}} of a manic cycle, sleep-deprived psychosis may appear, further complicating the ability to <b>think</b> <b>clearly.</b> [...] Racing thoughts and misperceptions lead to frustration and decreased ability to communicate with others.|$|E

2500|$|Most expeditions use oxygen {{masks and}} tanks above [...] Everest can be climbed without {{supplementary}} oxygen, {{but only by}} the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans do not <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 percent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen {{in order to reach}} the top, about five percent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen. Travelling above 8,000 feet altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia. This decrease of oxygen to the brain can cause dementia and brain damage, as well as other symptoms. One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.|$|E
2500|$|Jessie Gruman, who interviewed 200 {{patients}} and families about how they used scientific information after devastating medical diagnoses, said, [...] "I fear that the trend toward consumer-driven healthcare will disproportionately damage {{the health of the}} less educated and less wealthy, and that the net effect on the nation's health has already proved negative." [...] She concluded that most patients are unable to make critical decisions about their healthcare in the consumer-driven model. Some people, called [...] "monitors," [...] track down detailed information, while other people, called [...] "blunters," [...] don't want information. One blunter, a theoretical physicist, said he would be [...] "insulted" [...] if someone read 15 papers on theoretical physics and asked him to help design an experiment; he pays his doctor to explain his choices. A [...] "monitor," [...] a lawyer, applied her legal research skills but couldn't <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> enough to decide. People turn to the Internet, become overwhelmed, or don't understand the significance of the information. [...] "Most health information is bad news," [...] is stressful, and makes decisions even more difficult.|$|E
2500|$|In {{testimony}} to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 15, 2007, former Deputy Attorney General Comey was asked to recall {{the events of the}} evening of March 10, 2004, when, (at the behest of President Bush,) Gonzales and Bush's then-chief-of-staff Andrew H. Card Jr. sought to bypass Comey's refusal to authorize [...] "a particular classified program," [...] by appealing to the ailing John Ashcroft in a visit to his hospital bedside, as he recovered from surgery for pancreatitis. [...] According to Comey, he had consulted with AG Ashcroft prior to his hospitalization and, (though Ashcroft had previously signed off on the program many times in previous years,) the two of them came to agree that there had arisen legitimate concerns, which interfered with the ability of the Attorney General's office, [...] "to certify (the program's) legality, which was our obligation for the program to be renewed." [...] More than a week later, Comey continued, Ashcroft had become extremely ill and his wife had forbidden any visitors to his hospital room, so when he and the other officials met at his bedside on March 10, he was very concerned about General Ashcroft's ability to <b>think</b> <b>clearly</b> about the issue at hand.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947, the San Francisco Symphony {{went on a}} transcontinental tour, {{performing}} 56 {{concerts in}} 57 days. Leplin's orchestral piece Comedy was chosen to be a featured work of this tour. Leplin first conducted Comedy in San Francisco, and at the Greek Theatre at UC Berkeley, on May 23. Alexander Fried wrote, “It is a speedy, whimsical, tight-knit score. Its strong points are its adroit, tireless energy, its high-strung impudence and its spicy, tingling mixtures of orchestral sound.” Samuel T. Wilson wrote of the April 21 performance in Columbus, Ohio: “Mr. Leplin <b>thinks</b> <b>clearly,</b> concisely, and naturally in modern musical idioms. His instrumental writing is notably lucid and direct...an exceedingly effective essay...indications were that Mr. Leplin has definite gifts as a conductor.” Of the performance in Sacramento, Mila Landis wrote: the composer “conducted Comedy with great zeal...(it) proved to be stimulating...it issues a peremptory challenge for interest and attention.” ...|$|R
