40|$|This {{working paper}} {{documents}} {{the construction of}} the 1994 and 1995 Mozambican social accounting matrices (SAMs). The aggregate macro-SAM is called MACSAM, and the disaggregated version is MOZAM. With 13 agricultural and two agricultural processing activities, the primary sectors are particularly well represented in MOZAM. There are also 40 commodities, and the three factors of production: agricultural and non-agricultural labour, and capital. Two household types (urban and rural) are identified, and government expenditure is divided into two separate accounts, recurrent government and government investment. MOZAM includes a number of innovative features, partly reflected in household demand, where a distinction is made between home consumption of own production and private consumption of marketedcommodities. Home consumption avoids <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>margins.</b> Thus, MOZAM captures prevailing incentives for households to avoid markets and function more as autonomous production/consumption units. The disaggregation of household demand brings marketing margins in focus in relation to decisions regarding production. However, transactions costs are also important for exported and imported commodities. Domestic, export and import marketing margins are therefore explicitly broken out for each activity in MOZAM. Procedures used to balance MACSAM and MOZAM are also documented, including the use of maximum entropy methods to estimate the SAMs, which make efficient use of all available data in a framework that incorporates prior information and constraints.

40|$|A {{recursive}} dynamic economy-wide model incorporating productivity changes due to {{the introduction}} of promising maize and wheat varieties evaluates foresights for future food security, well-being and economic performance in Kenya. Adoption of promising new maize and wheat varieties not only increases overall economic growth and food availability, it also reduces import dependency and increases the welfare of vulnerable populations, especially rural households in lowland regions. Although maize-producing rural households in the highlands do not gain in terms of real incomes because of declining land income, they benefit from the increased food consumption stimulated by lower food prices. Promising maize technologies will have positive spill-over effect on all crops, mainly on wheat, and have larger positive impact on food security than the expected productivity change from the current promising wheat varieties. Although the lowland economy does not benefit from the adoption of new crop technologies, rural households in this region benefit the most in terms of increases in food and non-food consumption. The welfare gain in terms of food security is further amplified when technological change for the two crops is complemented by a reduction in the marketing costs, which facilitates market access for the increased surplus and further reduces domestic prices. With low marketing costs resulting from reduced <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>margins</b> for these two crops, even highland maize producing households experience an increase in real income and the demand for both food and non-food commodities increase substantially, generating significant linkages between agriculture and other sectors.

30|$|Regarding {{the source}} data, the Belgian SUT {{available}} from Eurostat {{are the same}} as those published by the Belgian NAI. The NA data underlying the first release of the WIOD MRIO tables (taken from the OECD’s STAN database) are identical to the corresponding vintage of the NA published by the NAI. This facilitates the comparison between the Belgian SUT from UpdateSUT and the IntSUT from WIOD. However, for IO benchmark years, the construction of valuation tables for <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> <b>margins,</b> taxes and subsidies is based on firm-level data and detailed fiscal data in UpdateSUT (FPB 2010), i.e. the methodology for estimating those tables differs from what is done by the WIOD consortium. For trade, there is also a difference in source data between UpdateSUT and WIOD. Merchandise trade statistics for Belgium are established according to two different concepts: the community concept and the national concept (see NAI 2010, for full detail on the two concepts). Data in community concept are internationally comparable and reported for international databases like COMTRADE, used for constructing WIOD MRIO tables. They comprise all cross-border transactions with a change in ownership as well as transactions for processing. Merchandise trade data in national concept are derived from those in community concept and are used in building the NA and balance of payments statistics. Compared to data in community concept, they do not comprise cross-border transactions of non-residents. In UpdateSUT, use tables are split into uses of domestic production and imports based on trade data in national concept at firm-level for IO benchmark years (Van den Cruyce 2004). 8 First, firm-level imports and exports are compared at the most detailed product-level (8 -digit Combined Nomenclature) to identify re-exports. Then, remaining imports are matched to firm-level input use by product. Thus, methodological differences compared to WIOD are clearly driven by differences in the available data (firm-level data by product in national concept vs. product-level data in community concept). In particular, the identification of re-exports is different in WIOD: there are re-exports for a specific product when exports exceed domestic production. For services, the use table of imports is determined based on detailed service trade data by EBOPS 9 category according to the specific methodology described in Hambÿe (2001). Finally, WIOD also proceeds to necessary modifications of the data for Belgium in the process of constructing the IntSUT to align mirror export and import flows and, further down the line, in the process of constructing MRIO tables when it comes to balancing world-wide flows and estimating flows to the RoW.|$|E
