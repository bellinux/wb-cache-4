A 90 -day nose-only inhalation study on Sprague-Dawley rats was performed, combining classical and systems toxicology approaches. Reduction in respiratory minute volume, degree of lung inflammation, and histopathological findings in the respiratory tract organs were significantly less pronounced in THS 2. 2 -exposed groups compared with 3 R 4 F-exposed groups. Transcriptomics data obtained from nasal epithelium and lung parenchyma showed concentration-dependent differential gene expression following 3 R 4 F exposure that was less pronounced in the THS 2. 2 -exposed groups. Molecular network analysis showed that inflammatory processes were the most affected by 3 R 4 F, while the extent of THS 2. 2 impact was much lower. Most other <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoints</b> evaluated did not show exposure-related effects. Where findings were observed, the effects were similar in 3 R 4 F- and THS 2. 2 -exposed animals.

30|$|Using {{the example}} of the {{specific}} <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoint</b> genotoxicity the potential of bio-analytical instruments as tools in effect-directed analysis is demonstrated. Genotoxic potentials of sediments from different river basins such as the Rhine, Elbe, Danube and Oder were analyzed with the Ames-fluctuation test in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In sediment pore waters of the investigated rivers a low mutagenic potential could be measured occasionally when standard test strains were used. However, the fractionation of sediment extracts showed that particle bound genotoxic substances are detectable especially in the medium polar fractions. PAH, including several that are listed as priority hazardous compounds in Annex X of the EU WFD, contribute significantly to the mutagenic potential. Nevertheless, many compounds that were previously not defined as priority hazardous substances play an important role. As an example Dibenzopyrene isomers were identified, some of which have a high genotoxic (and carcinogenic) potential. The extention of the test battery to metabolically competent test strains which express enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism pathways, broadened significantly the range of detectable genotoxins in direction of medium polar to polar compounds. These test strains also showed mutagenicity in pore waters of fresh sediments. In a contaminated site in the Elbe catchment area, many heterocyclic and N-substituted compounds were detected, possibly determining the high mutagenic potential of the site.|$|E
30|$|Effect-based tools {{have a great}} {{potential}} to monitor chemical contamination {{on the basis of}} its interaction with standardised biological laboratory systems indicating the exposure to chemicals with a specific mode of action (MoA) or effects on survival, growth or reproduction of aquatic organisms. In contrast to current chemical monitoring, effect-based tools provide measures for the load of an environmental compartment with all chemicals exhibiting an effect on a <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoint</b> and thus reduce the risk that major contributors to risk are overlooked. However, a careful analysis and prioritisation of MoAs is required and has been made by Busch et al. [5] for about 1000 chemicals that are frequently detected in European water bodies. More than 50 effect-based tools addressing prominent MoAs are under evaluation with individual chemicals, defined mixtures and environmental mixtures. In several case studies, panels of these tools were tested successfully for their applicability on environmental samples [39 – 41]. A key component for the identification of hazard drivers in complex mixture exposure is the EDA approach, where combinations of non-target/target screening [31] with bioanalytical tools can be applied in different tiers to identify drivers of toxicity or in combination with toxicity information or hazardous properties of encountered substances [35, 42]. Stepwise approaches for the use of bioanalytical tools, which details the developing methodologies for innovative monitoring also including mixtures, have been presented [5, 22, 43].|$|E
40|$|TheTh UK has {{developed}} a simple scheme to provide practical control advice to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), to assist them in their risk assessments and risk management decisions. This scheme makes use of toxicological hazard information indicated by R-phrases assigned under the European Union (EU) classification system, to assign substances to hazard bands. In the UK scheme, the allocation of substances to hazard bands according to R-phrases has taken into account three key factors: whether or not the <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoint</b> has an identifiable dose threshold; the seriousness of the resultant health effect; and the relative exposure levels at which toxic effects occur. Based on all these considerations, R-phrases have been allocated to hazard bands within the scheme. An evaluation exercise has been undertaken, to compare the output of the scheme with established health-based occupational exposure limits, for more than 100 subst-ances. The results of this exercise demonstrate that as far as possible, the scheme recommends control strategies which should provide adequate control. This scheme is potentially a very powerful means of helping SMEs adequately control chemical health risks in the workplace. Since it utilises the EU-agreed classification system, the scheme can be applied to any substance supplied and used in the workplace and it may also be used internationally. ICrown copyright © 1998.

We quantified the inhibitory effects of both copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on C. elegans <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoints</b> to elucidate their biological effects. Several <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoints</b> were analyzed in C. elegans, including nematode reproduction, feeding behavior, and average body length. We examined three wild C. elegans isolates together with the Bristol N 2 laboratory strain to {{explore the influence of}} different genotypic backgrounds on the physiological response to copper challenge. All strains exhibited greater sensitivity to copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate, as indicated by reduction of average body length and feeding behavior. Reproduction was significantly reduced only at the highest copper dose, though still more pronounced with copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on neurons, cells with known vulnerability to heavy metal toxicity. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was observed in up to 10 % of the population after copper oxide nanoparticle exposure. Additionally, mutants in the divalent-metal transporters, smf- 1 or smf- 2, showed increased tolerance to copper exposure, implicating both transporters in copper-induced neurodegeneration.

In the survivorship experiments, we tested 3 distinct developmental phases in HV effluent dilutions from 50 % to 1 %. The HV effluents considerably reduced the sur-vivorship of the naupliar stages at concentrations of> 1 % (P 1 % in Tisbe sp. (P < 0. 05), and no copepodid survived at 50 % (P < 0. 01).

Toxicogenomic profile showing subtle changes in gene expressions following nanosilver exposure is a sensitive <b>toxicological</b> <b>endpoint</b> for this purpose. We evaluated the Caco 2 cells and global gene expression profiles as tools for predictive rapid toxicity screening of nanosilver. We evaluated and compared the gene expression profiles of Caco- 2 cells exposed to 20 nm and 50 nm nanosilver at a concentration 2. 5 μg/ml. The global gene expression analysis of Caco 2 cells exposed to 20 nm nanosilver showed that a total of 93 genes were altered at 4 h exposure, out of which 90 genes were up-regulated and 3 genes were down-regulated. The 24 h exposure of 20 nm silver altered 15 genes in Caco 2 cells, out of which 14 were up-regulated and one was down-regulated. The most pronounced changes in gene expression were detected at 4 h. The greater size (50 nm) nanosilver at 4 h exposure altered more genes by more different pathways than the smaller (20 nm) one. Metallothioneins and heat shock proteins were highly up-regulated as a result of exposure to both the nanosilvers. The cellular pathways affected by the nanosilver exposure is likely to lead to increased toxicity.
