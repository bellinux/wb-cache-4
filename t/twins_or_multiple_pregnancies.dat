40|$|Background- Considering {{the hazards}} of macrosomia and low birth weight, the {{estimation}} of birth weight before delivery is of paramount importance. An easy-to-do method of birth weight estimation is fundal height measurement using only a tape measure. In the present study, we determined the association between fundal height and actual birth weight and calculated the specificity, sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values for the method. Methods- Standard fundal height was measured on 450 pregnant women who were hospitalized in Imam Khomeini and Shariati Hospitals in Tehran, Iran, for delivery during a 6 -month period in 2000. All measurements were performed within the 5 last days of pregnancy. Inclusion criteria were normal pregnancy, cephalic presentation of the fetus and maternal weight of less than 91 kg. The parturient patients with systemic disease, history of stillbirth, poly or oligohydramnios, placental abnormality, <b>twin</b> <b>or</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and fetal congenital anomaly {{were excluded from the}} study.

The specificity of estimated weight was 91. 5 % when the real birth weight was within the normal range.

40|$|Background: Whether or not {{relative}} {{measures of}} income poverty effectively reflect children's life chances {{has been the}} focus of policy debates in the UK. Although poverty is associated with poor child and maternal mental health, few studies have assessed the effect of moving into poverty on mental health. To inform policy, we explore the association between transitions into poverty and subsequent mental health among children and their mothers. Methods: In this longtitudinal analysis, we used data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a large nationally representative cohort of children born in the UK between Sept 1, 2000, and Jan 11, 2002, who participated in five survey waves as they progressed from 9 months of age to 11 years of age. Our analysis included all children and mothers who were free from mental health problems and not in poverty when the children were aged 3 years. We only included singletons (ie, not <b>twins</b> <b>or</b> other <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies)</b> and children for whom the mother was the main respondent to the study. The main outcomes were child socioemotional behavioural problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) at ages 5 years, 7 years, and 11 years and maternal psychological distress (Kessler 6 scale). Using discrete time-hazard models, we followed up families without mental health problems at baseline and estimated odds ratios for subsequent onset of maternal and child mental health problems associated with first transition into poverty, while adjusting for confounders, including employment transitions. We further assessed whether or not change in maternal mental health explained any effect on child mental health. Findings: Of the 6063 families in the UK Millennium Cohort study at 3 years who met our inclusion criteria, 844 (14 %) had a new transition into poverty compared with 5219 (86 %) who remained out of poverty. After adjustment for confounders, transition into poverty increased the odds of socioemotional behavioural problems in children (odds ratio 1 · 41 [95 % CI 1 · 02 – 1 · 93]; p= 0 · 04) and maternal psychological distress (1 · 44 [1 · 21 – 1 · 71]; p< 0 · 0001). Controlling for maternal psychological distress reduced the effect of transition into poverty on socioemotional behavioural problems in children (1 · 30 [0 · 94 – 1 · 79]; p= 0 · 11). Interpretation: In a contemporary UK cohort, first transition into income poverty during early childhood was associated with an increase in the risk of child and maternal mental health problems. These effects were independent of changes in employment status. Transitions to income poverty do appear to affect children's life chances and actions that directly reduce income poverty of children are likely to improve child and maternal mental health.

More research should be seriously constructed to focus on different techniques that would make LOD as valuable as possible without the nightmare of adhesion formation, for example, evaluating bipolar fine-needle drilling approach as compared to bipolar hydrolaparoscopic approach [33]. In conclusion, the documented high prevalence of adhesions among infertile as well as women who conceived following LOD is an adding evidence to the established risk of post-LOD adhesion formation. Following microsurgical principles would minimize the risk of these adhesions except periovarian adhesions. There is a bad need for studies on more refinement of LOD to make it as less adhesiogenic procedure as possible.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{couples are}} faced with the dilemma of a higher order <b>multiple</b> <b>{{pregnancy}}</b> there are three options.

The acceptability of these options for the couple will depend on their social background and underlying beliefs. This review focused on reduction in the number of fetuses. OBJECTIVES: To assess a policy of multifetal reduction with a policy of expectant management of women with a triplet <b>or</b> higher order <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (30 September 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), and PubMed (to 30 September 2002).

Ideally, assisted reproduction technology practitioners seek a balance between optimum ovarian stimu-lation and successful treatment outcome with minimal rate of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) <b>or</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> However, despite many years of clinical experience, there are no precise methods to com-pletely prevent severe OHSS, except by withholding the ovulation-inducing trigger of hCG. Individualization of treatment according to the specific risk factor and the specific response in the current cycle with the option of freezing of all embryos, or replacement of only a single embryo, has the potential of reducing the risk and the severity of the syndrome in susceptible cases. We offer a triage aimed at eliminating the occurrence of severe ovar-ian hyperstimulation syndrome on the basis of several clinical observations, including the role of GnRH antagonist in controlled ovarian stimulation protocols, the option of freezing of all embryos, or replacement of only a single embryo in the blastocyst stage. Key words: controlled ovarian stimulation/ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome/prevention Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction. Its cardinal features are marked ovarian enlargement and acute third-space flui...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Fetus in fetu is an {{extremely}} rare condition wherein a malformed fetus {{is found in the}} abdomen of its twin. This entity is differentiated from teratoma by its embryological origin, its unusual location in the retroperitoneal space, and the presence of vertebral organization with limb buds and well-developed organ systems. The literature cites less than 100 cases worldwide of twin fetus in fetu. Case presentation A two-and-a-half-month-old Asian Indian baby boy had two malformed fetuses in his abdomen. The pre-operative diagnosis was made by performing an ultrasound and a 64 -slice computer tomography scan of the baby's abdomen. Two fetoid-like masses were successfully excised from the retroperitoneal area of his abdomen. A macroscopic examination, an X-ray of the specimen after operation, and the histological features observed were suggestive of twin fetus in fetu. Conclusion Fetus in fetu is {{an extremely}} rare condition. Before any operation is carried out on a patient, imaging studies should first be conducted to differentiate this condition from teratoma. Surgical excision is a curative procedure, and a macroscopic examination of the sac should be done after <b>twin</b> <b>or</b> <b>multiple</b> fetus in fetu are excised. </p...|$|R
