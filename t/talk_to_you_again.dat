2500|$|Prior to his {{departure}} from Taipei, Aquino gave an interview from his {{room at the}} Grand Hotel in which he indicated {{that he would be}} wearing a bulletproof vest. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: [...] "You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of 3 or 4 minutes it could be all over, and I {{may not be able to}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> after this." [...] His last few moments in the flight while being interviewed by the journalist Jim Laurie, and just prior to disembarking from the flight at Manila airport, were recorded on camera.|$|E

6000|$|... "He's doing splendidly now," [...] he said, {{listening}} to the sleeper's more regular respiration: [...] "and I'd advise <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go now, Mr. Ford, before he wakes, lest he {{might be tempted to}} excite himself by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again.</b> He's really quite out of danger now. Good-night! I'll drop in on you at the hotel when I return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} be able to do that now," [...] the captain said. [...] "This is most important. However, the steward will take charge of you, and I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> presently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] the seneschal said heartily. [...] "I {{shall be}} glad to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again,</b> sir; but at present, madame, {{it is time to}} mount. The troops are mustering, and we have a long ride before us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will not," [...] he answered, [...] "but I shall <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> {{about this}} before we land. I {{mean to say that}} you must let me give you my card, and you will know, at any rate, that there is some one in England to whom you can send if you are in need of a friend." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think its}} {{purchasing}} value would include even the gnadige Frau," [...] said Paul, who had laughed only {{to hide the}} uneasiness that Yerba's approach to the tabooed subject had revived in him. She shook her head; then, recovering her tone of gentle banter, said, [...] "There--I've made a confession. If the colonel <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> about my conquests, you will know that at present my affections are centred on the Baron's mother. I admit it's a strong point in his--in ANYBODY'S--favor, who can show an unblemished maternal pedigree. What a pity it is you are an orphan, like myself, Mr. Hathaway! For I fancy your mother {{must have been a}} very perfect woman. A great deal of her tact and propriety has descended <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Only it would have been nicer if she had given it <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> like pocket money, as occasion required--which you might have shared with me--than leaving it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in one thumping legacy." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (laughingly {{appealing}} to the heavens). She calls it nasty sneering stuff! Well, well: I'll never <b>talk</b> like that <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again,</b> dearest. It only means {{that you are a}} beautiful woman, and that we all love you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{come and}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> when there's less rum in your wits," [...] said Wolverstone, rising. [...] "Meanwhile ye'll please to {{remember}} the tale I've told, and say nothing that'll make me out a liar. They all believes me, even the men as sailed wi' me from Port Royal. I've made 'em. If they thought as how you'd taken the King's commission in earnest, and for the purpose o' doing as Morgan did, ye guess what would follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The plan is {{certainly}} worth thinking of," [...] Captain Heraugiere said. [...] "I will {{turn it over}} in my mind for a day, and will then <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again.</b> It would be a grand stroke, {{and there would be}} great honour to be obtained; but it will not do for me to go to Prince Maurice and lay it before him until we have a plan completely worked out, otherwise we are more likely to meet with ridicule than praise." ...|$|E
6000|$|I do so {{wish that}} you could be with me, so that I could [...] <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again.</b> Aunt Stanbury is the most affectionate [...] and kindest friend in the world; but she has always been [...] so able to have her own way, because she is both clever [...] and good, that I find myself almost like a baby with her. [...] She has been talking to me again about Mr. Gibson; and it [...] seems that Mr. Gibson really does mean it. It is {{certainly}} [...] very strange; but I do think now that it is true. He is to [...] come on Friday. It seems very odd that it should all be [...] settled for him in that way; but then Aunt Stanbury is so [...] clever at settling things! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{main thing}} about playing the guitar, though, was that I {{was able to}} sit by myself and play and dream. And I was always happy doing that. I used to go off in the {{bathroom}}, because the bathroom had tiles, {{so it was a}} slight echo chamber. I'd turn on the faucet so that water would run - I like that sound, it's very soothing to me - and I'd play. In the dark. 'Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with <b>you</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And he {{answered}} them and said, 'I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about {{all other things}} that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Neither now, nor at any time, will I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about God.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Scarcely that," [...] she replied, [...] "only, you see, {{it seemed}} {{waste of time}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with the foils on, and a little dangerous, perhaps, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with them off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Neighbours,--Prior's Oak {{has gone}} into the water, and folks {{said that it was}} for a sign that the monks would never come back to Bratham, and that it was the Lord's wind that put it there. And, neighbours, as ye know, the broad Bratham lands and the fat marshes down by the brook passed by king's grant to a man that knew not clay from loam, or layer from pasturage, and from him they passed by the Lord's will to me, as I have asked you here to-day to celebrate. And now, neighbours, I have a mind, and though it seem to you but a childish thing, yet I have a mind, and have set myself to fulfil it. When I was yet a little lad, and drove the swine out to feed on the hill yonder, when the acorns had fallen, afore Farmer Gyrton's father had gracious leave from the feoffees to put up the fence that doth now so sorely vex us, I found one day a great acorn, as big as a dow's egg, and of a rich and wondrous brown, and this acorn I bore home and planted in kind earth in the corner of my dad's garden, {{thinking}} that it would grow, and that one day I would hew its growth and use it for a staff. Now that was fifty long years ago, lads, and there where grew Prior's Oak, there, neighbours, I have set my Staff to-day. The monks have told us how in Israel every man planted his fig and his vine. For the fig I know not rightly what that is; but for the vine, I will plant no creeping, clinging vine, but a hearty English oak, that, if they do but give it good room to breathe in, and save their heirloom from the axe, shall cast shade and grow acorns, and burst into leaf in the spring and grow naked in the winter, when ten generations of our children, and our children's children, shall have mixed their dust with ours yonder in the graveyard. And now, neighbours, I have talked too long, though I am better at doing than talking; but ye will even forgive me, for I will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again,</b> though on this the great day of my life I was minded to speak. But I will bid you every man pledge a health to the Caresfoot's Staff, and ask a prayer that, so long as it shall push its leaves, so long may the race of my loins be here to sit beneath its shade, and even mayhap when the corn is ripe and the moon is up, and their hearts grow soft towards the past, to talk with kinsman or with sweetheart of the old man who struck it in this kindly soil.'" ...|$|E
