40|$|The paper {{considers}} main {{directions of}} the technological {{development of the}} Belarusian power-supply system. Comparative analysis of the economic efficiency of thermal power station modernization {{on the basis of}} steam- and gas technology, nuclear technology development and simple renovation of the worn-out generating capacities of thermal power stations has been carried out in the paper. Selection of the priority direction pertaining to optimization of industrial structure of the Belarusian power-supply system has been {{made on the basis of}} the presented minimum-specific cost criterion. The paper reveals that in the medium-term period the most optimum development of the Belarusian electrical power engineering is a technological  modernization  due to predicted  changes in natural gas and nuclear fuel costs. The modernization presupposes construction of <b>topping</b> <b>plants</b> in addition to the existing steam- and turbine equipment at thermal power stations.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} {{to develop a}} new type of coal fired plant for electric power generation. This new type of plant, called a second generation or topping pressurized circulating fluidized bed combustion (<b>topping</b> PCFB) <b>plant,</b> offers the promise of efficiencies greater than 46 percent (HHV), with both emissions and a cost of electricity that are significantly lower than conventional pulverized coal fired plants with scrubbers. The <b>topping</b> PCFB <b>plant</b> incorporates the partial gasification of coal in a carbonizer, the combustion of carbonizer char in a pressurized circulating fluidized bed combustor (PCFB), and the combustion of carbonizer fuel gas in a topping combustor to achieve gas turbine inlet temperatures of 2, 300 F and higher. After completing pilot plant tests of a carbonizer, a PCFB, and a gas turbine topping combustor, all being developed for this new plant, the authors calculated a higher heating value efficiency of 46. 2 percent for the plant. In that analysis, the plant operated with a conventional 2, 400 psig steam cycle with 1, 000 F superheat and reheat steam and a 2. 5 inch mercury condenser back pressure. This paper identifies the efficiency gains that this plant will achieve by using supercritical pressure steam conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{thermodynamic}} {{advantages of}} fuel-cell systems are studied to: (i) evaluate {{the increase in}} plant exergy efficiency when incorporating fuel-cell units into electrical power generating stations and (ii) identify and discuss their effect on the components of such plant systems. Topping conventional Rankine cycle power plants {{with a range of}} commercial fuel cells is shown to increase the exergetic efficiency of the plant by up to 49 %, raising that efficiency from the value of 41. 5 % for the conventional power plant without fuel cells to about 62 % for the fuel-cell-topped power plant. This improvement stems primarily from the improved exergetic efficiency of fuel oxidation in these proposed <b>topping</b> power <b>plants,</b> as contrasted with the highly dissipative combustion process in conventional fuel-fired ones...|$|R
50|$|Associated {{purchased}} the Amoroco Terminal in 1923 from the American-Oriental Refining Company (AMORCO) {{and consisted of}} a <b>topping</b> <b>plant,</b> storage tanks, a wharf, pipelines and pumping equipment. The next year a clarifying plant and an Edeleanu liquid dioxide plant, {{the first in the}} United States, were constructed at the Avon Refinery. The quality of the oils treated was so excellent that it prompted the U.S. Navy to purchase these lubricants exclusively from the Avon Refinery for many years. By 1925 the Avon Refinery became the first West Coast refinery to produce gasoline with tetraethyl lead additive and in 1926 the tanker ship S.S. McKittrick received the first crude receipt at the Amorco Wharf. The Southern Pacific Company bought the terminal in 1929 to construct a new railroad drawbridge a year later. In 1926, the Associated Oil Company stock owned by the Pacific Oil Company, which was formed by Southern Pacific Company to handle their oil interests, was sold to a new holding company, the Tide Water Associated Oil Company, which also acquired the Tide Water Oil Company at the same time. Standard Oil of New Jersey, the largest stockholder in Tide Water at the time, later formed a holding company, Mission Corporation, to hold the stocks of Tide Water and Associated.|$|E

40|$|Sweet corn is {{the most}} {{important}} canning crop grown in Iowa. The average annual pack in this state {{for the past five years}} is approximately 2, 500, 000 cases. High grade seed, both as to canning quality and vitality, is of primary importance to the canning industry. Due perhaps to its sugary character, sweet corn is more difficult to cure than field corn. Also, it is a plant of less vigor and more subject to diseases. Greater care is therefore required in curing and handling the seed. This study was undertaken to secure information regarding: 1. Methods of hastening the curing of sweet corn seed in the field by <b>topping</b> the <b>plants,</b> by opening the husks and by curing in the shock. 2. The kiln drying of sweet corn seed. 3. The influence of immature seed. 4. Relation of vigor of germination to yield...|$|R
30|$|Simple {{refineries}} {{are often}} referred to as <b>topping</b> or hydroskimming <b>plants</b> since they only split crude oil into its main components and perform basic finishing operations. Topping facilities are basically just a distillation tower, while hydroskimmers also contain reforming and hydrotreating, and sometimes aromatics recovery units. Simple refineries maintain a high straight run fuel oil production and produce a high straight run fuel oil. Most coking facilities have cracking capacity, but not all cracking facilities have cokers. Coking refineries upgrade most of the fuel oil to lighter products.|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} unknown polyamine conjugate that accumulates in senescing ovaries of pea (Pisum sativum L.) was shown by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and chemical synthesis to be N 4 -hexanoylspermidine (hexanoyl-spd) This structure was indicated by {{analysis of the}} dansylated polyamine using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, following purification by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, acid hydrolysis of the compound yielded spermidine and hexanoic acid. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that spermidine was substituted at N 4 in the conjugate. Hexanoyl-spd was synthesized, and its didansyl derivative was shown to have an identical mass spectrum and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time as the derivatized natural compound. Further confirmation of its structure was obtained by comparison of the synthetic and natural polyamines as trifluoroacetyl derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This new polyamine conjugate is present in pea ovaries at low levels at anthesis and its concentration remains low in developing seeded fruit or in parthenocarpic fruit that have been induced by application of growth regulators to emasculated flowers or by <b>topping</b> the <b>plant.</b> Conjugate levels are also low in parthenocarpic fruit induced naturally in the slender (la crys) mutant. However, levels of hexanoyl-spd increase progressively in senescing petals and ovaries, beginning at anthesis or 2 d later, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Xylem fluid was {{analyzed}} for numerous solutes to characterize chemically the sap {{as a medium}} for forming and transporting metal complexes. The stem exudate was collected hourly for 8 hours from topped 31 -day-old soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) and 46 -day-old tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants grown in normal (0. 5 micromolar) and Za-phytotoxic nutrient solutions. Soybean plants were grown in the normal and high-Zn solutions for 24 days; tomato plants were grown for 32 days. The exudate {{was analyzed}} for seven organic acids, 22 amino acids, eight inorganic solutes, apparent ionic strength, and pH. Significant changes in many solutes occurred over the 8 -hour sampling period. These fluctuations depended on plant species, individual solute, and Zn treatment, and demonstrated that extrapolation of xylem-fluid analyses to whole-plant xylem sap is valid only for sap samples collected shortly after <b>topping</b> a <b>plant.</b> Exudate pH decreased over the 8 -hour period for both species; exudate ionic strength increased for tomato and decreased for soybean. At the normal-Zn treatment (0 to 1 hour), the highest acid micromolar concentrations in soybean exudate were: asparagine, 2, 583; citric, 1, 706; malic, 890; and malonic, 264. Under the same conditions, the highest acid micromolar concentrations in tomato exudate were: maleic, 1, 206; malic, 628; glutamine, 522; citric, 301; and asparagine, 242. Cysteine and methionine were above detection limits only in soybean exudate. Zinc phytotoxicity caused significant changes in many solutes. The analyses reported here provide a comprehensive data base for further studies on metal-complex equilibria in xylem fluid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{and short}} interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {{are two major}} classes of small RNAs. They play {{important}} regulatory roles in plants and animals by regulating transcription, stability and/or translation of target genes in a sequence-complementary dependent manner. Over 4, 000 miRNAs and several classes of siRNAs {{have been identified in}} plants, but in tobacco only computational prediction has been performed and no tobacco-specific miRNA has been experimentally identified. Wounding is believed to induce defensive response in tobacco, but the mechanism responsible for this response is yet to be uncovered. Results To get insight into the role of small RNAs in damage-induced responses, we sequenced and analysed small RNA populations in roots and leaves from wounding or <b>topping</b> treated tobacco <b>plants.</b> In addition to confirmation of expression of 27 known miRNA families, we identified 59 novel tobacco-specific miRNA members of 38 families and a large number of loci generating phased 21 - or 24 -nt small RNAs (including ta-siRNAs). A number of miRNAs and phased small RNAs were found to be responsive to wounding or topping treatment. Targets of small RNAs were further surveyed by degradome sequencing. Conclusions The expression changes of miRNAs and phased small RNAs responsive to wounding or topping and identification of defense related targets for these small RNAs suggest that the inducible defense response in tobacco might be controlled by pathways involving small RNAs. </p...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{the quality}} of fruits depends on local {{conditions}} experienced by the fruit during its development. In cotton, fruit quality, and more specifically {{the quality of}} the fibre in the fruit, depends on interactions between fruit position in the plant architecture, temperature and agronomic practices, such as sowing time, mulching with plastic film and <b>topping</b> of the <b>plant's</b> main stem and branches. To quantify this response of cotton fibre quality to environment and management, we developed a simulation model of cotton growth and development, CottonXL. Simulation of cotton fibre quality (strength, length and micronaire) was implemented at the level of each individual fruit, in relation to thermal time (represented by physiological age of the fruit) and prevailing temperature during development of each fruit. Field experiments were conducted in China in 2007 to determine model parameters, and independent data on cotton fibre quality in three cotton producing regions in China were used for model validation. Simulated values for fibre quality closely corresponded to experimental data. Scenario studies simulating a range of management practices predicted that delaying topping times can significantly decrease fibre quality, while sowing date and film mulching had no significant effect. We conclude that CottonXL may be used to explore options for optimizing cotton fibre quality by matching cotton management to the environment, taking into account responses at the level of individual fruits. The model may be used at plant, crop and regional levels to address climate and land-use change scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{calibrate}} and validate the adaptation of TOMGRO (TOMato GRowth), a crop growth simulation model for tomato, to the short-term cropping technique and to conditions in Greece. Current practice in plastic greenhouses in Mediterranean regions is to stop the indeterminate development of the plant after {{a limited number of}} trusses by removing the terminal bud of the <b>plant</b> (i. e. <b>topping).</b> Experiments were carried out in the farm of the University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece, during the autumn and winter periods of 2005 and 2007. Crop development, growth and greenhouse climate were measured. Results showed that dry matter partitioning in the plant was not altered by the <b>topping</b> of the <b>plant</b> but the duration {{of the life of the}} fruit, from setting to maturity, was shortened. The TOMGRO model was modified accordingly, calibrated over the winter 2005 data and then using data from winter 2007. Good agreement was observed between the measured and simulated plant development indicators, biomass and fruit production. Satisfactory agreement was obtained for the plant leaf area (LA), usually one of the weak points of TOMGRO. Based on these results, we conclude that this adaptation of TOMGRO accurately simulates the development of short-term tomato crops grown in greenhouses and can therefore be used for decision support to help growers optimise the operation of the greenhouse.

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{terminal}} buds (topping) and sucker control are two practices {{that have an}} impact on yield and quality of dark tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Topping breaks apical dominance and encourages the growth of axillary buds (suckers). Following topping, growth regulator chemicals known as suckercides are commonly used to prevent axillary bud growth. Research has demonstrated that topping time, height, and sucker control method influence the quality and yield of the final product. Delaying topping past a critical developmental stage has been shown to reduce leaf yield. Topping height varies among geographical regions with most dark tobacco producers topping to a height of 12 to 16 leaves. Previous studies indicate that plants topped to 16 leaves had higher leaf yields than those topped to 12 leaves if late-season soil moisture was adequate. The opposite effect was observed when late-season soil moisture was below average because the small upper leaves on plants topped to 16 leaves did not receive the moisture needed for proper development. The moisture they did receive could have been diverted to improve the yield and quality of the larger, more valuable leaves if the smaller ones had been removed. Several options exist for chemical control of tobacco axillary buds ranging from contact to systemic materials. Performance of these materials is influenced by several factors including environmental conditions prior to and following application. Research plots were established at Western Kentucky University 2 ̆ 7 s Agricultural Research and Education Complex in Bowling Green, Kentucky to evaluate the efficacy of various sucker control methods and evaluate the effect of topping height on axillary bud growth. Data collection was completed in the summer of 2000. Three sucker control methods and three topping heights were investigated. The first sucker control method was a single application of a local systemic suckercide at topping. The second method was a sequential application using a contact suckercide at topping followed by a local systemic applied seven days later. The third method, which served as the control, was <b>topping</b> the <b>plants</b> but not applying any suckercides. The experiment utilized a split-plot design with 9 treatments and 4 replications. The plots consisted of two 7 m rows per plot, with 102 cm row spacing and 89 cm in-row spacing. Data collected include number of suckers per plant and kilograms of sucker biomass per plant. Statistical analysis indicated no sucker control method by topping height interaction; thus sucker control and height data are discussed separately. Suckers per plant and sucker biomass per plant did not differ among those plots receiving a suckercide application. Topping height did not influence sucker number or biomass...|$|R
40|$|In sub-Saharan {{areas of}} Africa, cotton growers no longer cut the shoot tips from <b>plants</b> (<b>topping),</b> {{although}} manual topping was promoted {{at the start}} of the 20 th century to improve yield and, surprisingly, to reduce pest incidence. In these areas, the bollworms Helicoverpa armigera Hübner, Earias spp., and Diparopsis watersi Rothschild are responsible for the majority of cotton yield losses, and the use of pyrethroids has resulted in resistance in field populations of H. armigera. In the face of these problems and given the scarcity of literature on the effects of topping on pest control, we assessed bollworm infestation levels in 12 trials comparing manual topping and non-topping cotton plots in Mali over a sixyear period (2002, 2003, and 2005 to 2008). Topping was performed at the emergence of the 15 th sympodial branch or at 10 days after the first flower opening. Our results showed no significant difference in seed cotton yields between topped and non-topped cotton. Bollworm infestations (all species) were always lower on topped cotton and 7 out of 12 trials showed significantly lower infestations on topped cotton. In plots of topped cotton, we recorded an average of 56 % fewer H. armigera larvae, 68 % fewer Earias spp. larvae, and 71 % fewer D. watersi larvae with respectively 5, 4, and 3 out of 12 trials with significant differences in favor of topping and no significant difference in favor of non-topping. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report decreases in D. watersi larval infestation with cotton topping. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms involved in these effects and to ensure that topping is economically attractive for farmers. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
