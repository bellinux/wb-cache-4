40|$|We {{examined}} the lifetime experience of hallucinations and delusions associated with transient methamphetamine-related psychosis (MAP), persistent MAP and primary psychosis among {{a cohort of}} dependent methamphetamine users. Participants were classified as having (a) no current psychotic symptoms, (n = 110); (b) psychotic symptoms only when using methamphetamine (<b>transient</b> <b>MAP,</b> n = 85); (c) psychotic symptoms both when using methamphetamine and when abstaining from methamphetamine (persistent MAP, n = 37), or (d) meeting DSM-IV criteria for lifetime schizophrenia or mania (primary psychosis, n = 52). Current psychotic symptoms were classified as a score of 4 or more {{on any of the}} Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale items of suspiciousness, hallucinations or unusual thought content in the past month. Lifetime psychotic diagnoses and symptoms were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. <b>Transient</b> <b>MAP</b> was associated with persecutory delusions and tactile hallucinations (compared to the no symptom group). Persistent MAP was additionally associated with delusions of reference, thought interference and complex auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile hallucinations, while primary psychosis was also associated with delusions of thought projection and passivity. The presence of non-persecutory delusions and hallucinations across various modalities is a marker for persistent MAP or primary psychosis in people who use methamphetamine...|$|E

40|$|REPLY: We {{are excited}} that our study has {{garnered}} {{the attention of}} others and pleased {{to have the opportunity}} to respond and debate the merits of our findings. Dr. Nitzan’s letter (6) to the editor raises some interesting points regarding the interpreta-tion of our results and how it relates to his work and the work of Lossius et al. (5), which we would like to address. In our study (4), we first identified a negative relationship between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and forearm blood flow (BF), wherein <b>transient</b> <b>MAP</b> elevations were followed by a decrease rather than an increase in BF. This seemed to oppose our basic presumptions of hemodynamics in which pressure drives flow (Poiseuille’s law).

40|$|We {{have used}} the neurokinin NK- 2 {{receptor}} as a model to examine how receptor desensitization affects cellular responses. The liganded receptor transiently activates phospholipase C (PLC) and is rapidly phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues in its C-terminal domain. Mutant receptors lacking this domain mediate persistent activation of PLC. We now show that, in transfected Rat- 1 cells, mutant receptor mediates ligand-induced DNA synthesis, morphological transformation and growth in soft agar, whereas wild-type (wt) receptor does not. Wt receptor causes only <b>transient</b> <b>MAP</b> kinase activation. In contrast, MAP kinase activation by mutant receptor is sustained for > 4 h. Neither wt nor mutant receptor couples to Ras activation. Downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC) has little effect on MAP kinase activation, DNA synthesis and transformation. Mutant receptors also promote stronger protein tyrosine phosphorylation and stress fibre formation than does wt receptor. Thus, C-terminal truncation allows the NK- 2 receptor to signal sustained MAP kinase activation, cell growth and transformation by a Ras- and PKC-independent mechanism. Our results reveal {{the importance of the}} C-terminal 'desensitization domain' in suppressing the oncogenic potential of a prototypic PLC-coupled receptor...|$|E
40|$|During {{studies of}} the {{activation}} and inactivation of the cyclin B-p 34 cdc 2 protein kinase (MPF) in cell-free extracts of Xenopus oocytes and eggs, we found that a bacterially expressed fusion protein between the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein and the Xenopus c-mos protein kinase (malE-mos) activated a 42 kDa MAP kinase. The activation of MAP kinase on addition of malE-mos was consistent, whereas the activation of MPF was variable and failed to occur in some oocyte extracts in which cyclin A or okadaic acid activated both MPF and MAP kinase. In cases when MPF activation was <b>transient,</b> <b>MAP</b> kinase activity declined after MPF activity was lost, and MAP kinase, but not MPF, could be maintained {{at a high level}} by the presence of malE-mos. When intact oocytes were treated with progesterone, however, the activation of MPF and MAP kinase occurred simultaneously, in contrast to the behaviour of extracts. These observations suggest that one role of c-mos may be to maintain high MAP kinase activity in meiosis. They also imply that the activation of MPF and MAP kinase in vivo are synchronous events that normally rely on an agent that has still to be identified...|$|E

40|$|FRS 2 is a lipid-anchored docking {{protein that}} plays an {{important}} role in linking fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and nerve growth factor receptors with the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. In this report, we demonstrate that FRS 2 forms a complex with the N-terminal SH 2 domain of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp 2 in response to FGF stimulation. FGF stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shp 2, leading to the formation of a complex containing Grb 2 and Sos 1 molecules. In addition, a mutant FRS 2 deficient in both Grb 2 and Shp 2 binding induces a weak and <b>transient</b> <b>MAP</b> kinase response and fails to induce PC 12 cell differentiation in response to FGF stimulation. Furthermore, FGF is unable to induce differentiation of PC 12 cells expressing an FRS 2 point mutant deficient in Shp 2 binding. Finally, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Shp 2 is essential for sustained activation of MAP kinase and for potentiation of FGF-induced PC 12 cell differentiation. These experiments demonstrate that FRS 2 recruits Grb 2 molecules both directly and indirectly via complex formation with Shp 2 and that Shp 2 {{plays an important}} role in FGF-induced PC 12 cell differentiation...|$|E

By having a team of robots working together, a large area can be scanned quickly, or a smaller area scanned in greater detail.

We are specifically interested in the case where members of the robot team are working in close proximity to each other. The advantage of this teamwork is that it greatly speeds up the surveying process; the area can be quickly covered even when the robots use a random motion exploration approach. However, the disadvantage of the close proximity is that it is possible, and even likely, that the laser ranging data from one robot include many depth readings caused by another robot. We refer to this as mutual interference. Using a team of two Pioneer 3 -AT robots with tilted SICK LMS- 200 laser sensors, we evaluate several techniques for fusing the laser ranging information so as to eliminate the mutual interference.

A total of 13 IOH patients (nine men; median age, 27 years) rose from squatting twice, once with LBMT and once without. In addition, seven healthy volunteers (five men; median age, 27 years) were studied in a cross-over study design. They stood up from the squatting position three times, once combined with LBMT. Blood pressure (Finometer) was measured continuously, and CO (cardiac output) by Modelflow and TPR (total peripheral resistance) were computed. MAP, CO and TPR were compared without and with LBMT Using a questionnaire, the perceived effectiveness of LBMT in the patients' daily lives was evaluated. With LBMT, the minimal MAP after standing up was higher in both groups (19 mmHg in patients and 13 mmHg in healthy subjects). In healthy subjects, the underlying mechanism was a blunted TPR decrease (to 47 % compared with 60 %; P < 0. 05), whereas in the patients no clear CO or TPR pattern was discernible. During follow-up, eight out of ten patients using LBMT reported fewer IOH symptoms. In conclusion, LBMT is a new intervention to attenuate the transient blood pressure decrease after standing up from squatting, and IOH patients should be advised about the use of this mancieuvr...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} Albot 1, the second in the series of Albots. Albots are robots created in Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) Laboratory at AUT for investigating hard problems in cognitive science concerning spatial cognition. To create an Albot, a computational theory is first proposed and then implemented on a mobile robot. Its behavior is then studied to gain further insights into the underlying process. With Albot 1, the problem being studied is: how an imprecise and incomplete map is computed without integrating every successive view of the environment. Albot 1 is based on Yeap's (Yeap 2011 a) computational theory of perceptual mapping. That this problem is both worth studying and hard {{is evident in the}} controversial debate among psychologists as to the nature of such a map. Despite much interest, the notion of a cognitive map remains vague and controversial. Furthermore, robotics research has shown that the traditional process of integrating every successive view to form a map is highly susceptible to cumulative errors coming from the sensors. These errors must be corrected in order to produce a useful map, but in doing so, what is produced is a precise and complete map. Humans don't have such a map in their head but then, how and what kind of map is produced? Yeap's (2011 a) theory suggests that a map is formed from integrating views representing local environments visited. In his model, viewers don't track their position in the map, nor are errors from the sensors corrected. Rather, they attend to landmarks and remember the local environment that they are about to explore. Describing these local environments using a single global frame of reference gives one a map of the entire environment traversed. The theory was tested with a robot equipped with a laser and an odometer. Six experiments were conducted to evaluate both the process and the map computed. Specifically, the experiments evaluated: (i) Albot 1 's ability to compute a map in an office-like environment, (ii) Albot 1 's ability to orient itself, (iii) Albot 1 's ability to handle errors, (iv) Albot 1 's ability to compute its map using continuous motion, (v), and (vi) Albot 1 's performance compared with SLAM-based algorithms. The results provide confirmatory evidence that the process is both robust and useful. It successfully captures the overall shape of the environment traversed as long as no parts are being re-visited. Once a familiar part is being re-visited, the previous experience of that part of the environment is wiped from the map and overridden. The map computed is thus both a transient and a dynamic map. It represents a trace of one's experience through the environment rather than a complete map of the environment experienced. Having successfully computed a <b>transient</b> <b>map,</b> I also investigated how a more enduring map, {{in the form of a}} topological network of places, could be built. A further three experiments were conducted to evaluate Albot 1 's "cognitive map". The successful implementation of Albot 1 introduces a new paradigm for robot mapping and provides significant insights into how Yeap's (2011 a) perceptual mapping works...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthesia in {{guinea pigs}} (GPs) {{has often been}} {{described}} as difficult and risky. Therefore, the included publications invested {{the effect of the}} mostly used anaesthesias MMF (medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl), isoflurane (Iso) and ketamine-xylazine (KX) on physiological parameters in GPs. Throughout the anaesthesia, the GPs cardiovascular parameters were monitored, using abdominally implanted radiotelemetry devices to obtain optimal data quality. The surgical approach used for the implantation of the radiotelemetry transmitter is presented in detail in the first publication. For surgery, the GPs were anaesthetised with MMF (medetomi-dine-midazolam-fentanyl) and they were antagonised with AFN (atipamezole-flumazenil-nalxone) {{at the end of the}} surgery. For pain medication, the GPs were started on meloxicam (0. 4 mg/kg) and metamizole (80 mg/kg) 30 min before the surgery. Metamizole was continued for 24 h after surgery and meloxicam for 2 more days. During the implantation, they were additionally covered with the fentanyl component in MMF. Prior to the surgery, enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) was applied for antibiotic coverage which was continued for 2 more days. Using the implanted system, arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and core body temperature (BT) were measured throughout the first 24 h after the end of the implantation. The implantation approach led to the highest long-term survival rate reported to date, with 13 of 16 GPs (81 %) surviving. The GPs lost body weight (BW) until 2 d after surgery (- 11. 9 %, - 53. 6 g) but steadily increased their weight thereafter. The GPs had returned to physiological values in BP and BT at 8 h after abdominal surgery and at 24 h regarding HR. As GPs are stress-prone, recommendations for stress reduced handling were given for before, during and after the implantation. The findings on the effects of the implantation can be used as a model for other abdominal operations in the GP. The second publication described the investigation of the effects of one-time Iso, MMF and KX anaesthesia on the physiological parameters using the 13 implanted GPs. Each animal was anesthetised once with MMF, Iso and KX at an interval of 7 d. The entire anaesthesia pass was recorded radiotelemetrically and supplemented by manual measurements of respiratory rate (ReR), reflexes and blood glucose (BG). One anaesthesia pass included 120 min acclimatization time, of which the last 15 min were averaged as individual baseline values. The GPs were then premedicated; with Iso with atropine and with MMF and KX with sodium chloride as placebo. Ten minutes later, anaesthesia was initiated, for Iso anaesthesia using a pre-filled whole body chamber and for MMF and KX with intramuscular injections into the hind limbs. Anaesthesia was discontinued after 40 min by Iso supply stop, AFN antagonisation for MMF or partial antagonisation with atipamezole for KX anaesthesia. The MAP, HR, BT were measured continuously until at least 240 min after anaesthesia induction. Respiratory rate (ReR) was measured until at least 55 min and reflexes were tested until the GPs showed a positive righting reflex again. BG values were measured at 7. 5, 20 and 40 min during anaesthesia. With Iso use, all GPs reached a surgical tolerance, 11 did so with MMF anaesthesia and only 7 reached an operable state with KX. The induction, non-surgical tolerance and surgical tolerance phase durations did not differ considerably between the 3 anaesthetics. Following MMF and Iso there were short wake-up times (7. 6 & 12. 2 min), whereas it required 59. 7 min until the GPs regained their RR after KX. MMF anaesthesia led to a marked <b>transient</b> <b>MAP</b> decrease after antagonisation, otherwise the MAP and the HR were only mildly altered. Iso exposure led to a marked hypotension during anaesthesia maintenance (approx. 20 mmHg) and the HR was only mildly increased at the beginning of the anaesthesia. KX caused mild deviations from the normal physiology for MAP and HR during maintenance. However, after partial antagonisation, the MAP dropped and the GPs recovered only slowly. The HR was also reduced and increased only gradually during the wake-up following KX anaesthesia. All anaesthetics induced hypothermia, but the animals lost the most BT with Iso anaesthesia. Immediately after the end of the MMF and Iso anaesthesia, the GPs were able to quickly lift their BT back to the starting level through shivering. After KX anaesthesia only 3 of the 7 GPs had returned to 38. 8 °C after 5 h, the other 4 still had not reached pre-anaesthetic BT values after 8 h. Respiratory depression occurred with all 3 anaesthetics, with KX leading to a moderate (- 52 %) and Iso to a severe (- 71 %) hypoventilation. There was also a strong irritation of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract through the respiratory gas. Subsequent mucosal secretion could only be alleviated by atropine pre-medication in the short term. BG increases were observed during KX (moderate) and strongly during MMF anaesthesia. The reflex responses varied considerably between the anaesthetics. They were strong and quick during MMF anaesthesia and slightly less so with KX use. Iso exposure led to weak and slow reflex responses. Overall, MMF was determined to be the anaesthesia of choice; Iso can only be advised for short and non-painful procedures and we advise against the use of KX anaesthesia in GPs. After investigating the effects of single anaesthesia with Iso, MMF and KX, the third paper de-scribed the impact of repeated MMF and Iso anaesthesia. KX was not tested for anaesthesia repetition because of its highly unfavourable effects in the recovery phase. Twelve instrumented MS were anesthetised in 2 anaesthesia sets, 6 times over 3 weeks with either only Iso or only MMF. Each anaesthesia repetition was performed as described for the single anaesthesia. All GPs reached a surgical tolerance and this could be maintained for the desired 40 min. Overall, the anaesthetic profiles of MMF and Iso did not change greatly with anaesthesia repetition. During Iso exposure, the repeated atropine premedication caused the HR to increase, and this increase remained longer with progressing repetitions. During MMF the wake-up phase short-ened from the 1 st to the 2 nd repetition and the MAP and the HR decreased from the first to all following anaesthesias. During the MMF maintenance, there was a large individual variation in the BP between the GPs, but the single animal always exhibited similar MAP values during all of the repetitions. At 40 min of the MMF anaesthesia, the BG had increased particularly strongly in those anaesthesias that were performed with an interval of 2 d. The BT decrease and the BW increase were not altered. Both anaesthetics can therefore be used repeatedly in the GP with very little change in the anaesthesia profile compared to the single anaesthesias. The GPs developed increasingly stronger defensive reactions which were particularly pronounced with Iso. They reduced the reliability with which the injections of MMF and atropine could be performed and with that the induction of anaesthesia. Although repeated Iso anaesthesia led to lesser repetition-related effects, the highly disadvantageous effects of hypotension, mucous production and hypoventilation with Iso anaesthesia remained and were further worsened by the strong defensive reactions. MMF led to a much more beneficial anaesthesia with the only drawback of altering the BG and the occurring hypothermia. In conclusion, MMF is superior for both single and repeated anaesthesia use in the GP. Iso is only preferable to MMF, if multiple anaesthesias need to be performed on the same day. Die Anästhesie an Meerschweinchen (MS) wurde schon oft als schwierig und risikoreich be-schrieben. Mit diesem Hintergrund wurden die drei häufigsten Narkosemittel, Medetomidin-Midazolam-Fentanyl (MMF), Isofluran (Iso) und Ketamin-Xylazin (KX), hinsichtlich ihres Einflusses auf die physiologischen Parameter im MS untersucht. Die Überwachung vor, während und nach den Anästhesien wurde durch einen abdominal implantierten Radiotelemetriesender durchgeführt. In der ersten Publikation wurde die Implantation des Telemetriesenders detailliert dargestellt. Für den Eingriff wurden die MS mit MMF anästhesiert und die Narkose wurde am Ende des Eingriffes mit AFN (Atipamezol- Flumazenil-Naloxon) wieder aufgehoben. Die Analgesie bestand aus Meloxicam (0, 4 mg/kg) und Metamizol (80 mg/kg), womit 30 Minuten vor dem Start der Operation begonnen wurde. Während der Anästhesie wurde die Analgesie zusätzlich über die Fentanyl Komponente des MMFs erhalten. Nach der Implantation wurde Metamizol für 24 Stunden und Meloxicam für 48 h fortgesetzt. Zur antibiotischen Versorgung erhielten die MS Enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg) vor dem Beginn der Operation und in den zwei darauffolgenden Tagen. Unter Verwendung des implantierten Senders wurden der arterielle Blutdruck (BD), die Herzfrequenz (HF) und die Kernkörpertemperatur (KT) in den ersten 24 h nach dem Ende der Implantation gemessen. Die durchgeführte Implantationsherangehensweise führte zu der bisher höchsten publizierten Langzeitüberlebensrate mit 13 von 16 Tieren (81 %). Bis 2 Tage nach der Operation verloren die Tiere an Körpergewicht (- 11, 9 %, - 53, 6 g). Danach stieg ihr Gewicht jedoch stetig wieder an. Die MS waren nach 8 h nach ihrer abdominalen Operation zu physiologischen Werten in Blutdruck und Körperkerntemperatur und nach 24 h zu normalen HF zurückgekehrt. Aufgrund der hohen Stressanfälligkeit von MS, wurden Empfehlungen für stressarmes Handling, für vor, während und nach der Implantation gegeben. Die Erkenntnisse über die Auswirkungen der Implantation können modelhaft auf andere Bauchoperationen im MS angewendet werden. Die zweite Veröffentlichung beschrieb die Untersuchung der Wirkungen von einmaligen Iso, MMF und KX Anästhesien auf die physiologischen Parameter unter Verwendung der 13 implan-tierten MS. Jedes Tier wurde einmalig mit MMF, Iso und KX im Abstand von 7 d anästhesiert. Der gesamte Anästhesiedurchgang wurde radiotelemetrisch aufgezeichnet und durch manuelle Erhebungen für Atemfrequenz (AF), Reflexe und Blutglukose (BG) ergänzt. Ein Anästhesiedurch-gang beinhaltete 120 min Akklimatisierungszeit, wovon die letzten 15 min als individuelle Baselinewerte gemittelt wurden. Danach wurden die MS prämediziert; bei Iso mit Atropin und bei MMF und KX mit Natriumchlorid als Placebo. Zehn min später wurde die Anästhesie eingeleitet mit einer vorgefluteten Ganzkörperkammer für die Iso Anästhesie und für MMF und KX mit intramuskulären Injektionen in die Hintergliedmaßen. Die Anästhesie wurde für nach 40 min aufgehoben durch Iso-zufuhrstopp, AFN Antagonisierung oder Teilantagonisierung mit Atipamezol. Der BD, die HF, und die KT wurden kontinuierlich bis mindestens 240 min nach Anästhesieeinleitung gemessen. Die AF wurde bis mindestens 55 min gemessen, und die Reflexe wurden bis zum Erreichen eines positiven Stellreflexes getestet. Bei 7, 5, 20 und 40 min während der Anästhesie wurden BG Werte erhoben. Mit der Anwendung von Iso erreichten alle MS eine chirurgische Toleranz, mit der MMF-Anästhesie waren es 11 MS und nur 7 erreichten einen operablen Zustand mit KX. Die Induktion, nicht-chirurgische Toleranz und chirurgische Toleranzphasendauer unterschieden sich nicht erheblich zwischen den 3 Anästhetika. Auf die Narkosen mit MMF und Iso folgten kurze Weckzeiten (7, 6 & 12, 2 min), während es 59, 7 min benötigte, bis die MS ihren RR nach KX wiedererlangten. Die MMF-Anästhesie führte zu einer kurzen, deutlichen BD-Abnahme nach Antagonisierung, ansonsten wurden der BD und der HF nur geringfügig verändert. Die Iso-Exposition führte zu einer ausgeprägten Hypotonie während der Anästhesieerhaltung (ca. 20 mmHg) und die HF war zu Beginn der Anästhesie nur leicht erhöht. KX verursachte nur milde Abweichungen von der normalen Physiologie für BD und HF während der Anästhesieerhaltung. Nach der Teilantagonisierung fiel der BD die HF und die KT jedoch ab und die MS erholten sich nur langsam. Alle Anästhetika induzierten eine Hypothermie, aber unter der Iso Narkose verloren die MS am schnellsten und am meisten Körpertemperatur. Direkt nach dem Ende der MMF- und Iso-Narkose konnten sie ihre KT über Kältezittern schnell wieder auf das Ausgangslevel heben. Nach der KX-Anästhesie waren jedoch nur 3 der 7 GPs auf 38, 8 ° C KT zurückgekehrt, die anderen 4 hatten auch nach 8 h noch nicht wieder ihre Ausgangskörperkerntemperatur erreicht. Eine Atemdepression trat bei allen 3 Narkosemitteln auf, am ausgeprägtesten jedoch unter der Iso-Narkose (- 71 %). Dort trat zusätzlich eine starke Reizung der Schleimhäute der Atemwege durch das Atemgas auf. Die nachfolgende Schleimsekretion konnte durch die Atropinprämedikation nur kurzfristig gelindert werden. Der BG-Spiegel stieg während der Anästhesie mit KX (mäßig) und während der MMF-Anästhesie stark an. Die Reflexantworten variierten erheblich zwischen den Anästhetika. Sie waren stark und schnell während der MMF Anästhesie und etwas weniger deutlich ausgeprägt unter der KX-Anwendung. Die Iso-Exposition führte hingegen zu schwachen und langsamen Reflexantworten. Insgesamt ist MMF die Anästhesie der Wahl beim MS; Iso sollte nur für kurze und nicht schmerzhafte Verfahren beraten werden und wir empfehlen die Verwendung von KX Anästhesie bei GPs. Nach der Untersuchung der Einzelanästhesieffekte mit Iso, MMF und KX, beschrieb die dritte Publikation die Auswirkungen der wiederholten MMF- und Iso-Anästhesie. Aufgrund der deutli-chen Nachtteile der KX-Narkose in der Aufwachphase wurde KX von der Wiederholungsstudie ausgeschlossen. Zwölf instrumentierte MS wurden in 2 Anästhesiesets jeweils 6 mal über 3 Wo-chen mit entweder nur Iso oder nur MMF anästhesiert. Der Aufbau der einzelnen Anästhesie-durchgänge war derselbe wie bei in Einzelanästhesien beschrieben. Alle GPs erreichten eine chirurgische Toleranz, und diese konnte für die gewünschten 40 min aufrechterhalten werden. Insgesamt änderten sich die Anästhesieprofile von MMF und Iso nur sehr gering im Verlauf der Anästhesiewiederholung. Durch die wiederholte Atropinprämedikation nahm die HF zu und dieser Anstieg blieb mit fortschreitenden Wiederholungen immer länger bestehen. Bei der MMF Anästhesie verkürzte sich die Aufwachzeit vor allem von der 1. auf die 2. Wiederholung. Der BP und die HF nahmen nach der ersten Wiederholung für die nachfolgenden Anästhesien ab. Während der MMF-Anästhesieerhaltung zeigten die MS große individuelle Variationen im BD. Jedes einzelne Tier blieb jedoch während allen Wiederholungen auf seinem eigenen Niveau. Die BG war bei den MMF-Anästhesien zwischen denen nur 2 Tage lagen 40 min nach der Anästhesieeinleitung besonders hoch. Die KT-Abnahme trat sowohl bei MMF, als auch bei Iso während der Anästhesie auf und die Körpergewichtsentwicklung veränderte sich durch die Wiederholungen nicht. Sowohl Iso als auch MMF können nach diesen Ergebnissen daher wiederholt in MS eingesetzt werden. Trotzdem entwickelten die MS zunehmend stärkere Abwehrreaktionen gegen die Anäs-thesieeinleitung, die bei Iso besonders ausgeprägt waren. Sie reduzierten die Zuverlässigkeit, mit der die Injektionen von MMF und Atropin durchgeführt werden konnten und damit die Induktion der Anästhesie. Die Iso-Anästhesie führte zwar zu geringeren Wiederholungswirkungen im Vergleich zu MMF, das Anästhesieprofil mit der starken Atemdepression und Schleimproduktion und der starken Hypotension bestand jedoch weiterhin. Insgesamt sind die Effekte der Wiederholungen bei der MMF Anästhesie weitgehend vernachlässigbar und das Anästhesieprofil ist wesentlich vorteilhafter für die MS. Daher ist MMF für die einfache und wiederholte Anästhesie im MS das Anästhetikum der Wahl, es sei denn am selben Tag müssen mehrere Anästhesien durchgeführt werden müssen. In dem Fall ist Iso vorzuziehen...|$|E
40|$|Pervasive {{transcription}} of {{the genome}} produces both stable and transient RNAs. We developed transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq), a protocol that uniformly maps {{the entire range of}} RNA-producing units and estimates rates of RNA synthesis and degradation. Application of TT-seq to human K 562 cells recovers stable messenger RNAs and long intergenic noncoding RNAs and additionally <b>maps</b> <b>transient</b> enhancer, antisense, and promoter-associated RNAs. TT-seq analysis shows that enhancer RNAs are short-lived and lack U 1 motifs and secondary structure. TT-seq also <b>maps</b> <b>transient</b> RNA downstream of polyadenylation sites and uncovers sites of transcription termination; we found, on average, four transcription termination sites, distributed in a window with a median width of ~ 3300 base pairs. Termination sites coincide with a DNA motif associated with pausing of RNA polymerase before its release from the genome...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a four-channel high temperature radio-frequency {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (HTc rf SQUID) in a simple magnetically shielded room (MSR) {{that can be used to}} analyze the cardiac magnetic field. It is more robust and compact than existing systems. To achieve the high-quality magnetocardiographic signal, we explored new adaptive software gradiometry technology constructed by the first-order axial gradiometer with a baseline of 80 mm, which can adjust its performance timely with the surrounding conditions. The magnetic field sensitivity of each channel was less than 100 fT/√Hz in the white noise region. Especially, in the analysis of MCG signal data, we proposed the total <b>transient</b> <b>mapping</b> (TTM) technique to visualize current density map (CDM), then we focused to observe the time-varying behavior of excitation propagation and estimated the underlying currents at T wave. According to the clear 3 D imaging, isomagnetic field and CDM, the position and distribution of a current source in the heart can be visualized. It is believed that our four-channel HTc rf SQUID magnetometer based on biomagnetic system is available to detect MCG signals with sufficient signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. In addition, the CDM showed the macroscopic current activation pattern, in a way, it has established strong underpinnings for researching the cardiac microscopic movement mechanism and opening the way for its use in clinical diagnosis...|$|R

Electrical device data is collected by pulsed and DC measurements. Thermal data is collected through on-chip sensors-and through a full surface high resolution <b>transient</b> interferometric <b>mapping</b> (TIM). For {{the first time}} a data driven segmented electro-thermal transient model is proposed to describe accurately the thermal profile behavior for the mutli-trenched devices. Further investigations of the thermal heating impact on the driver due to the low thermal conductivity of the trenches (SiO 2) have been carried out. I...|$|R
40|$|Searching for {{electromagnetic}} (EM) phenomena {{originating in}} the Earth's crust prior to major earthquakes (M> 5) are the object of this exploratory study. We present {{the idea of a}} possible relationship between: (1) electro-chemical and thermodynamic processes in the Earth's crust and (2) ionic enhancement of the atmosphere/ionosphere with tectonic stress and earthquake activity. The major source of these signals are proposed to originate from electromagnetic phenomenon which are responsible for these observed pre-seismic processes, such as, enhanced IR emission, also born as thermal anomalies, generation of long wave radiation, light emission caused by ground-to-air electric discharges, Total Electron Content (TEC) ionospheric anomalies and ionospheric plasma variations. The source of these data will include: (i) ionospheric plasma perturbations data from the recently launched DEMETER mission and currently available TEC/GPS network data; (ii) geomagnetic data from ORSTED and CHAMP; (iii) Thermal infra-red (TIR) <b>transients</b> <b>mapped</b> by the polar orbiting (NOAA/AVHRR, MODIS) and (iv) geosynchronous weather satellites measurements of GOES, METEOSAT. This approach requires continues observations and data collecting, in addition to both ground and space based monitoring over selected regions in order to investigate the various techniques for recording possible anomalies. During the space campaign emphasis will be on IR emission, obtained from TIR (thermal infrared) satellites, that records land/sea surface temperature anomalies and changes in the plasma and total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere that occur over areas of potential earthquake activity...|$|R

In data analysis applications, as opposed to control, the input is often not known and is inferred as part of the (blind) identification. So it {{is an integral part of}} the model that should be considered when comparing different time series. Previous work on kernel distances between dynamical models assumed either identical or independent inputs. We extend it to arbitrary distributions, highlighting connections with system identification, independent component analysis, and optimal transport. The increased modeling power is demonstrated empirically on gait classification from simple visual features. 1...|$|R

This paper introduces a method {{on the basis of}} specialized CDM test structures including protection elements and sensitive monitor elements. These test structures mimic typical CDM-sensitive circuits found by physical failure analysis over the years. Manufactured in five different technologies, structures were assembled in both a regular package and a new package emulator. CDM stress tests, very-fast TLP tests, <b>transient</b> interferometric <b>mapping,</b> device simulation, and failure analysis lead to new insights in the complex interdependencies during CDM and underline the need of CDM-specific test structures...|$|R

40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} {{are at the}} core of all cellular functions and dynamic alterations in protein interactions regulate cellular signaling. In the last decade, mass spectrometry-based proteomics has delivered unprecedented insights into human protein interaction networks. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry has been extensively employed for focused and high-throughput studies of steady state protein-protein interactions. Future challenges remain in <b>mapping</b> <b>transient</b> protein interactions after cellular perturbations as well as in resolving the spatial organization of protein interaction networks. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry can be combined with quantitative proteomics approaches to determine the relative abundance of purified proteins in different conditions, thereby enabling the identification of transient protein interactions. In addition to affinity purification, methods based on protein co-fractionation have been combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to <b>map</b> <b>transient</b> protein interactions during cellular signaling. More recently, approaches based on proximity tagging that preserve the spatial dimension of protein interaction networks have been introduced. Here, we provide an overview of mass spectrometry-based methods for analyzing protein-protein interactions with a focus on approaches that aim to dissect the temporal and spatial aspects of protein interaction networks...|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} of a {{transient}} induced latch-up (TLU) problem is presented, which was identified during {{the development of a}} 60 V, 0. 8 m BiCMOS power control device. The mechanism was characterized by controlled transient latch-up testing and found to be fairly unusual, being triggered by a fast decreasing not necessarily negative spike or glitch on the positive supply pin. Emission Microscopy (EMMI) and <b>Transient</b> Interferometric <b>Mapping</b> (TIM) successfully located the parasitic silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR) structure.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automatic}} method to characterize calcium activity {{in a culture}} of cardiac cells from a sequence of microscopy fluorescence images. The approach quantifies both the response of each individual cell in the culture to external field stimulation and the propagation properties of calcium wave-fronts, thus providing complementary information at different physiological levels. The technique classifies the response of each cell as regular or irregular based {{on a set of}} dynamical and morphological features of the calcium <b>transients.</b> Isochronal <b>maps</b> were constructed from the local activation times across the culture, and the front propagation was classified as planar or non-planar.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{experimental}} extraction of the local maximum temperature occurring in silicon resistors when a transmission line pulse is applied. The local temperature is extracted by combining transmission line pulses of different amplitude and at different ambient temperatures with two-dimensional electrothermal simulation. This investigation has relevant practical applications. The obtained calibration curves enable to convert the phase shift information as obtained by interferometric techniques (e. g. in <b>Transient</b> Interferometric <b>Mapping)</b> into absolute temperature readings. Moreover, relevant physical parameters (e. g. resistivity) can be extracted {{as a function of}} the temperature by transient heating, i. e. by avoiding the detrimental artifacts involved with the static heating of semiconductor samples at high temperatures. This enables to calibrate device simulators at those high temperatures, which are required for the simulation of ESD events...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytohormone}} {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) is a classical plant hormone, responsible for regulation of abscission, diverse aspects {{of plant and}} seed development, stress responses and germination. It was found that ABA signal transduction in plants can involve the activity of type 2 C-phosphatases (PP 2 C), calcium, potassium, pH and a <b>transient</b> activation of <b>MAP</b> kinase. The ABA signal transduction cascades {{have been shown to}} be tissue-specific, the <b>transient</b> activation of <b>MAP</b> kinase has until now only been found in barley aleurone cells. However, type 2 C phosphatases are involved in the induction of most ABA responses, as shown by the PP 2 C-deficient abi-mutants. These phosphatases show high homology with phosphatases that regulate MAP kinase activity in yeast. In addition, the role of farnesyl transferase as a negative regulator of ABA responses also indicates towards involvement of MAP kinase in ABA signal transduction. Farnesyl transferase is known to regulate Ras proteins, Ras proteins in turn are known to regulate MAP kinase activation. Interestingly, Ras-like proteins were detected in barley aleurone cells. Further establishment of the involvement of MAP kinase in ABA signal transduction and its role therein, still awaits more study...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{research}} study {{has proposed a}} computational theory of perceptual mapping that shows how a useful inexact global perceptual map is computed without correcting sensor errors. An unexpected consequence of {{the theory is that}} the map computed is never closed, expanding ad infinitum. This creates an interesting <b>transient</b> perceptual <b>map</b> but then an important question arises: how does one compute an enduring map from it? In this paper, we address this question by showing how Albot 1 computes a topological-metric map from its perceptual map. Importantly, we show that the map computed is not based upon partitioning the physical environment into places of a fixed size and that these places, when combined using a single frame of reference, do not produce a precise global map. We show how such a map is used during navigation to provide expectations, say, to where exits in a current place can be found...|$|R
