500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!'

Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> that picture grossed $2 million.
