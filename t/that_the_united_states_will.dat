25|$|The Monroe Doctrine was {{included}} in President James Monroe's 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, Benito Juárez, diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an address}} to the nation {{delivered}} from the Oval Office on December 6, 2015, President Obama declared the shooting an act of terrorism, referring to the shooters as having [...] "gone down the dark path of radicalization" [...] and embracing a [...] "perverted version of Islam." [...] Obama said that [...] "the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it" [...] and promised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> [...] "destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us." [...] Obama also outlined the ongoing fight against ISIL (including U.S. airstrikes, financial sanctions, and targeted special operations) and urged Americans to not give in to fear.

You will declare <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba.

[...] At 6:45pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a [...] "set up" [...] for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.|$|E

In addition to the CIA documents, The New York Times reported that Golinger also obtained [...] "reams of documents from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit agency financed by the United States government, that show that $2.2 million was spent from 2000 to 2003 to train or finance anti-Chávez parties and organizations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Songun {{politics}} have also thrived on the ongoing nuclear crisis. [...] For the United States, given that its primary {{concern is the}} denuclearisation of the peninsula, the concept of military-first politics and ideology is a troubling one. Songun also seems to fit very well with the possession of nuclear weapons, and {{can be seen as}} a way of making such weapons central to the government's guiding ideology of self-governance. This leads to the concern that, the longer military-first ideology guides the North Korean government, the less likely it will be <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> be able to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme. A similar concern is that North Korea could perceive attempts at denuclearisation and normalisation of affairs with the United States as a threat to the primacy of the military within North Korea and, thus, a threat to songun ideology, a fear which puts into doubt the idea that North Korea may be(come) willing to give up its nuclear weapons programme.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first line}} of defence against {{invasion}} by the PRC is the ROC's own armed forces. Current ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations Act or any other treaty <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> defend Taiwan, even {{in the event of}} invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response. However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the [...] "area surrounding Japan" [...] mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to promote stability {{and to be able to}} respond in case of an armed conflict in the region – that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.|$|E

[...] In a Presidential Policy Guidance entitled [...] "U.S. Policy Standards and Procedures for the Use of Force in Counterterrorism Operations Outside the United States and Areas of Active Hostilities" [...] from May 2013 the United States government stated that lethal force by combat drones [...] "will be used only to prevent or stop attacks against U.S. persons, and even then, only when capture is not feasible and no other reasonable alternatives exist to address the threat effectively".

Obama said [...] "we are on track to achieve our goals" [...] in the Afghan war and to [...] "start reducing our forces next July." [...] He added the drawdown will [...] "conclude in 2014." [...] Obama appeared before reporters to announce {{the results of the}} Afghanistan war review, which was compiled from reports submitted by military, diplomatic and intelligence officials since mid-October 2010. The president had directed his national security staff to perform a [...] "diagnostic" [...] assessment of the December 2009 West point strategy after one year. They convened eight working-group and deputy-level meetings from 16 Nov. through 1 Dec.. An interagency team also visited Afghanistan and Pakistan from 25 October through 4 November to discuss the situation with key leaders first-hand. The summary document of the review included no specifics as to the potential size or pace of withdrawal, making no assessment as to whether any milestones have been reached and leaving substantial wiggle room for future decisions. [...] "As a result of our integrated efforts in 2010," [...] the report said, [...] "we are setting the conditions to begin transition to Afghan security lead in early 2011 and to begin a responsible, conditions-based U.S. troop reduction in July 2011." [...] The review concluded that the military surge of 30,000 troops has been a success, saying it [...] "reduced overall Taliban influence and arrested the momentum they had achieved in recent years in key parts of the country." [...] It added, however, that successes remain [...] "fragile and reversible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In their {{court papers}} on September 14, 2012 {{government}} lawyers said the plaintiffs had no basis to fear being {{locked up for}} their activities, and that the judge's order interfered with the president's powers {{at a time of}} war. Government attorneys argue that the executive branch is entitled to latitude when it comes to cases of national security and that the law is neither too broad nor overly vague. Judge Forrest's opinion is [...] "unprecedented, and the government has compelling arguments that it should be reversed," [...] prosecutors said. They called the permanent injunction an [...] "extraordinary injunction of worldwide scope." [...] Lawyers for the Obama administration also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> be irreparably harmed if it has to abide by a judge's ruling that it can no longer hold terrorism suspects indefinitely without trial in military custody. The government said that the injunction was an [...] "unprecedented" [...] trespass on power of the president and the legislature that by its very nature was doing irreparable harm. They also argued that the injunction places an undue burden on military commanders {{in a time of war}} while the plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of ever being detained [...] "in the foreseeable future." [...] The Court's injunction against application of section 1021 'in any manner, as to any person,'... combined with its mistaken view that section 1021 goes beyond reaffirming the authority contained in the AUMF, could impose entirely unjustified burdens on military officials worldwide, complicating the ability to carry out an armed conflict authorized by Congress in the public interest... Given the absence of any risk of impending harm to plaintiffs, the serious injury to the government and the public interest in the invalidation of a statute enacted by public representatives, and the possible effect on an ongoing armed conflict and the Executive's prerogatives in military affairs, a stay is necessary.|$|E
