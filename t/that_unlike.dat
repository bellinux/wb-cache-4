5|$|Britain was {{challenged}} again by France under Napoleon, {{in a struggle}} <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. It was not only Britain's position {{on the world stage}} that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, a {{construction}} project {{began on the}} interchange with US10 at the route's northern terminus. This construction consisted of bridge replacement over US10, {{as well as a}} new ramp connecting northbound M-47 to westbound US10 <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> the old ramp, does not conflict with westbound traffic exiting onto southbound M-47.|$|E

The apes, she argues, could be a new species unknown to science, a new subspecies of chimpanzee, or a hybrid of the gorilla and the chimp.

5|$|The film {{features}} the book Istanbul: The Imperial City (1996) by John Freely. William recommends this book to Anna, commenting <b>that</b> (<b>unlike</b> another {{book in the}} store) the author has at least been to Istanbul. In reality, Freely taught at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, and {{was the author of}} nine books about the city.|$|E
5|$|The note further elaborates <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> {{the rest}} of the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast {{majority}} of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E

Music critic Stephen Holden pointed out <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales, the two {{had always been a}} part of New York City. Both gained {{inspiration}} from the cityscape and the cultural variety of New York, and spoke of these influences in their songs.|$|E
5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> {{most major}} {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises. As a result, in the 2000s (decade), {{there has been a}} renewed interest in building skyscrapers in Manchester and other cities in Britain. Several residential, hotel and office developments are under construction or have recently been built in the city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E

5|$|The {{afterglow}} of GRB970508 {{reached a}} peak total luminosity 19.82days after the burst was detected. It then faded {{with a power}} law slope over about 100days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V=25.4±0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70±0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of z=0.83, suggesting <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{alphabet}} {{was designed}} to be able to write all of the vowels used in the Received Pronunciation as still spoken in 19th century Utah. The vowel inventory has also been attributed to the fact <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> other American pioneers, the Mormon pioneers were from New England as opposed to the American South. As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since merged in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in many dialects of English.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{generally}} well received, {{though not as}} positively as earlier games of the Yoshi series, such as Yoshi's Island. It holds average ratings of 75% at GameRankings and 73/100 at Metacritic. Craig Harris of IGN said it [...] "is {{one of the most}} original and unique games created for the system so far, and it's truly a design <b>that's</b> <b>unlike</b> anything you've played before." [...] He especially commended the multiplayer mode and gave the game an 8.8/10. Additionally, it won the IGN Editors' Choice Award on March 11, 2005.|$|R

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|Transformers: Dark of the Moon first premiered at the Moscow International Film Festival on June 23, 2011.

It was announced in November 2010 <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, no scenes in the film were shot with IMAX cameras.|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E
50|$|A {{writer in}} Romanian and French, Denis Buican has {{published}} several collections of poems, in sensitivity close to poems written by Romanian poets Mihai Eminescu, Lucian Blaga and Tudor Arghezi.

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>unlike</b> established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, {{he would}} build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{presented}} {{himself as the}} legitimate heir to Henry I and commenced rebuilding the kingdom in his image. Although Stephen had tried to continue Henry I's method of government during his reign, the younger Henry's new government characterised those nineteen years as a chaotic and troubled period, with all these problems resulting from Stephen's usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others. Various measures were immediately carried out although, since Henry spent {{six and a half}} years out of the first eight years of his reign in France, much work had to be done at a distance. The process of demolishing the unauthorised castles from the war continued. Efforts were made to restore the system of royal justice and the royal finances. Henry also invested heavily in the construction and renovation of prestigious new royal buildings.|$|E
5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued <b>that,</b> <b>unlike</b> Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E
