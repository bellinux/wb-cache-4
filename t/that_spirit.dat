5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe <b>that</b> <b>Spirit</b> baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain <b>that</b> <b>spirit.</b> He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed <b>that</b> <b>spirit</b> {{than the}} German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

25|$|Cassiodorus was {{a native}} Italian (Squillace, Bruttium), who rose to become advisor and {{secretary}} to the Gothic kings in various high offices.

The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In <b>that</b> <b>spirit,</b> Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E

2500|$|Spiritualism is {{the belief}} <b>that</b> the <b>spirits</b> of the dead have both the ability and the {{inclination}} {{to communicate with the}} living. The afterlife, or the [...] "spirit world", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs: <b>that</b> contact with <b>spirits</b> is possible, and <b>that</b> <b>spirits</b> are more advanced than humans, lead spiritualists to a third belief, <b>that</b> <b>spirits</b> are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about the nature of God. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as [...] "spirit guides"—specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance. Spiritism, a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America, especially in Brazil, emphasizes reincarnation.|$|R

Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged {{to set an example}} with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry, at that time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of Othello with <b>that</b> <b>spirit</b> in mind.|$|E

25|$|Several {{types of}} supernatural {{entities}} {{are believed to}} exist; they make themselves known by means of inexplicable sounds or happenings. Among these phenomena are khmaoc (ghosts), pret and besach (particularly nasty demons, the spirits {{of people who have}} died violent, untimely, or unnatural deaths), arak (evil spirits, usually female), neak ta (tutelary spirits residing in inanimate objects), mneang phteah (guardians of the house), meba (ancestral spirits), and mrenh kongveal (elf-like guardians of animals). All spirits must be shown proper respect, and, {{with the exception of the}} mneang phteah and mrenh kongveal, they can cause trouble ranging from mischief to serious life-threatening illnesses. An important way for living people to show respect for the spirits of the dead is to provide food for the spirits. If this food is not provided, the spirit can cause trouble for the offending person. For example, if a child does not provide food for the spirit of its dead mother, <b>that</b> <b>spirit</b> can cause misfortunes to happen to the child.|$|E
25|$|Many historians {{argue that}} the Compromise {{played a major role}} in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer {{relations}} with the Northeast. During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South. Others {{argue that the}} Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law ad helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies <b>that</b> <b>spirit,</b> but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.|$|E
