Belle shows up to tell everyone that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I have a husband, I have a family, my whole life has changed. It would be pretty strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky.

It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>bit</b> of choreography with male and female dancers.
