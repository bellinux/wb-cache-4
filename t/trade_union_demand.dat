It promised parliamentary democracy, land reform, nationalization of the industrial base, more powerful <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> <b>demands</b> for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the pre-1939 eastern border. Thus, the main difference between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, amounted not to radical economic and social reforms, which were advocated by both sides, but to their attitudes towards national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.|$|R

Various objectors associated with SRKS said that the group would organise legal action and public protests to ban the series from being broadcast if discussions with the television company, Zee TV, did not achieve their aim. They claimed that the Hindu-Muslim marriage involved a fictional character and was a distortion of history resulting from poor research. In 2014, SRKS organised a protest against Ekta Kapoor, who had produced the now-broadcast series. A month later, it was alleged that a group of around 40 SRKS members attacked the offices of Zee Media in Jaipur, a part of the television company that had broadcast the series.

30|$|High {{wage rate}} {{growth has been}} the basic cause of high {{inflation}} rate and unstable exchange rates. Therefore, to find the influences of industrial actions, inflation and real GDP growth on wage growth, the data for workdays lost to strikes and for other two variables were collected annually between 1963 and 2015.12 Inflation has been a main factor in creating wage growth. This means that when a country experiences low productivity growth in non-tradable goods and high wage growth, <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> can <b>demand</b> greater wage growth in {{a year as a}} compensation for inflation. However, this can also serve to increase inflation because the productivity growth of non-tradable goods does not increase at the same pace. This problem is caused by industrial actions dictated by the power of <b>trade</b> <b>unions.</b> Real GDP could have been taken as general wage-setting factor, but this policy was not explicitly considered in Turkey.|$|R

According to Lapid's book, this first colour newscast was prepared secretly by some [...] "enthusiastic workers" [...] of IBA, in order to avoid industrial actions by the technicians' <b>trade</b> <b>union,</b> who <b>demanded</b> higher salaries for operating colour equipment.

The campesinos were strongly repressed by authorities and some 20 families where expelled from the zone. In 1951 there was another strike among sawmill and forestry workers, who tried to form a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> and <b>demanded</b> higher salaries, as consequence about 40 leaders and their families where driven out of Neltume. Witnesses from this period record people being taken to Valdivia by Carabineros and estimates the duration of the strike in three months. The same witness states that Carabineros were asked by the sawmill boss to gun any striker found walking around in nighttime. The repression of this movement was according to historians Pino and Jelin so strong that only in the 1960s and during the Unidad Popular government did the workers managed form <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in the zone.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 Ramsay MacDonald {{returned}} to {{the leadership of the}} Labour Party from the Independent Labour Party. in the 1924 British election the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government but required assistance from the Liberal Party to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of the Labour Party accused the party of communist sympathies. Prime Minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party. MacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government status would endanger the new government because it would be opposed and blocked by the Conservatives and the Liberals who together held a majority of seats. The Labour Party had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921-1922: with the economy beginning to recover, British <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> <b>demanded</b> that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash {{between the government and the}} unions was averted, however the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government. MacDonald's most controversial action was having Britain recognize the government of the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British Conservative press, including the Daily Mail used this to promote a red scare, claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.|$|R

The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions.</b> This panel <b>demanded</b> that the Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions</b> adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions</b> was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions.</b>|$|R

The model is based upon an interaction between Keynesian fiscal economics, real wage growth, active labour market policies and state intervention. The purpose was to create a positive spiral as part of the business cycle, in accordance with Keynesian theory, as the creation of an expansive welfare state and public investment meant to maintain domestic demand over economic cycles ensured security, safety and stability to labour, capital, business and consumers. This, in turn, helped to ensure low inflation, by helping to prevent wage-price spirals and thereby strengthened <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in <b>demanding</b> rising real wages in line with productivity growth, which, combined with the effects of the welfare state and social programs, led to increased purchasing power and consumer confidence, resulting in rising general demand and an upwards, self-maintaining cycle which led to high growth rates and full employment, fueled by progressive taxation and redistribution of wealth, as that further increased spending power and ensured equality of incomes.

25|$|The textile {{industry}} {{started in the}} 1840s, which was followed up with mechanical workshops to build new machinery as the British embargo hindered import of textile machinery. An economic crisis hit the country from 1848, resulting in Marcus Thrane establishing the first <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> and <b>demanding</b> that quality for the law independent of social class. Parliament passed a series of laws abandoning economic privileges and easing domestic trade during the 1840s and 1850s. Population increase forced the clearing of new land, {{although some of the}} growth came in the cities. The population of Christiania reached 40,000 in 1855. By 1865 the population reached 1.7 million; the large increase was largely caused by better nutrition from herring and potatoes, a sharp decrease of infant mortality and increased hygiene. Emigration to North America started in 1825, with the first mass emigration commencing in the 1860s. By 1930, 800,000 people had emigrated, the majority settling in the Midwestern United States.|$|R
30|$|In Turkey, {{there are}} several factors that {{influence}} wage growth, which are being discussed for wage bargaining among the <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> employers’ associations and the government. The first thing <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> always <b>demand</b> {{from the government and}} the employers’ associations is a wage increase above the inflation rate. Thus, wage increases and the inflation rate have been moving in parallel. The most developed countries changed their policies in the 1980 s, to increase wage growth in accordance with productivity growth rates. 10 In practice, the developed countries basically aimed to consider wage increases in terms of GDP growth in order to eliminate inflation, and to follow an intensive export growth policy. 11 In contrast to the developed countries, Turkey is still implementing the same wage policy based on the inflation rate. However, the power of <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> cannot be ignored, as it continues to influence wage policy. In particular, workdays lost to strikes is considered {{to be the most important}} factor in this paper, because the main aims of industries are to keep producing. In a dispute about wage increases, the first thing that is decided by <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> is to organize strikes, and this causes workdays to be lost and entails costs for the employers. Hence, three factors that are assumed to influence wage growth are detailed in this paper. These are workdays lost to strikes, inflation and real GDP. The annual data of workdays lost to strikes until the year 1963, when the <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> became institutionalized, were collected, and their connection to inflation and real GDP and to wage growth was estimated by empirical analysis.|$|R
50|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland. The main reason was that <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in Britain <b>demanded</b> it as the price for cutting back on conscription exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but never enforced. The Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and called for open resistance to conscription. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists moved into Sinn Féin, a decisive moment marking the dominance of Irish politics by a party committed to leaving the UK altogether.|$|R

5000|$|Pendulum arbitration, {{otherwise}} known as final offer arbitration (or [...] "FOA"), {{is a type of}} interest arbitration in which the arbitrator chooses one of the parties' proposals on each (or perhaps all) disputed issues. For example, in the case of labor collective bargaining, a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> may <b>demand</b> a wage increase of 7% and the management may offer 3%. The arbitrator's decision has to choose between awarding a 3% or a 7% increase. This procedure is opposed to conventional interest arbitration, in which the parties present evidence and the arbitrator acts as fact-finder and crafts an award. In disputes over labor contracts, this dispute resolution procedure is known to be a common type of contract arbitration. Perhaps the most well-known instance is salary arbitration in Major League Baseball, where a certain class of players may elect to arbitrate their salary instead of accepting their team's salary offer. Final-offer arbitration is widely used to determine public union contracts in the United States, either as a substitute for collective bargaining or as a mechanism to determine the contract when bargaining has failed.|$|R

The project consisted in quantifying these effects with the help of a small econometric model. Besides comparing the states before and after the wage shock, the adjustment dynamics between the two states are depicted. The main results are, that employment in the retail industry bears the brunt of the adjustment, whereas prices are little affected.
