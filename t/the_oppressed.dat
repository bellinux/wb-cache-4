5|$|The {{entrance}} of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined {{stories of the}} grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of <b>the</b> <b>oppressed.</b> The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, {{it proved to be}} a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.|$|E

5|$|The Socialist-dominated French {{authorities}} actively supported PADESM. The French characterized {{this support}} {{as an effort}} to champion <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> masses and strengthen their protection against exploitative Hova elites. Governor General Jules Marcel de Coppet provided the party with space in public buildings for meetings. PADESM candidates in the January 1947 provincial elections received financial support from French settlers owing to the party's favorable disposition to the French administration.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E
5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation of life, with Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} {{of the conflict}} provided the pretext for violence between highland Merina and coastal Malagasy of other ethnic groups that were linked to precolonial history and politics. Merina Hova elites founded the MDRM {{not only in the}} interest of ending French rule, but also in regaining the political dominance of the Merina upon independence. In reaction to the founding of the MDRM, in 1946 the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed. It attracted membership from members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Initially a non-nationalist party, PADESM eventually favored a gradual process toward independence that would preserve close ties to France and prevent the reemergence of the precolonial Merina hegemony. The French authorities tacitly supported PADESM, which accused MDRM of launching the uprising to re-establish Merina rule. By aligning itself with PADESM, Socialist-dominated French politicians sought to cast themselves as champions of <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> masses against the exploitative Hova elites.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia has {{inspired}} scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has {{lingered in the}} West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero of <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia {{as a woman who}} created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.|$|E

25|$|The OLF {{believes}} that solidarity and cooperation among <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> peoples led by their respective forces {{is essential for}} realization of their common objectives of liberation. The organization has been working towards unity of struggle among <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> peoples to counter the enemy schemes and {{reduce the cost of}} achieving their political objectives of liberation. The OLF believes the alignment of the Ethiopian government with forces resisting genuine change in Ethiopia is posing a real threat to <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> and subjugated peoples in the country. The organization declares that there are indications that militaristic and chauvinistic elements who are aspiring to restore the old order are demanding for the reversal of what minimum change Oromo people have achieved through their struggle. It states that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is going to directly affect <b>the</b> <b>oppressed</b> nations and nationalities economically and in terms of human casualty, and continuation of suppression and violation of human rights by creating pretexts connected with the war situation. The OLF is prepared to revitalize and strengthen previous agreements concluded with some organizations of oppressed peoples and work towards a formation of a platform to co-ordinate and channel their human and material resources to meet the challenge of the day.|$|E
