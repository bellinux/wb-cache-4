5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> {{by assuming}} that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes {{the evolution of the}} Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stars are}} between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars {{may even be}} close to 13.8 billion years old—the {{observed}} age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe,</b> determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).|$|E
5|$|The {{invariant}} mass of {{an electron}} is approximately kilograms, or atomic mass units.

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei.

Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates of <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately {{the ages of the}} clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable to <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At {{the time of the}} Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E

5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and promethium (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} more than three times <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of 18±7milliseconds and {{that it may be}} possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered.

25|$|A notable {{exception}} to normative medieval eschatology {{is found in}} Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202), a Cistercian monk, who to an extent, stressed premillennial themes.

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms.

25|$|It {{was long}} thought that q was positive, {{indicating}} that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction.
