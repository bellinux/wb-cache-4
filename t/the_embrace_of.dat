5|$|Modern Japan's {{economic}} growth {{began in the}} Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> the market economy. Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia. The period of overall real {{economic growth}} from the 1960s to the 1980s {{has been called the}} Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{context of}} the Confrontation in the murk of Indonesian {{politics}} is extremely layered. Sukarno's choice of pursuing this strategy would {{come at the expense}} of an important program aiming at the rehabilitation of the damaged economy, as it relied upon funding from Britain and America, who would not support the strengthening of another Communist power forming in Asia. However, the Indonesian populace and much of the government, who had recently fought their way from the hands of Dutch rule, would likely not support the economic program as it would seem as if Indonesia was sliding back into <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> the 'imperialist' powers of the West. The proposal was also beginning to lose support from the army, as they learned that demobilisation and lessening of funding that the program entailed would affect them adversely. Confrontation, on the other hand, might serve as a far more stabilising force, as it garnered support from both the Communists and the military, whose internecine political conflict weakened Sukarno's government. A campaign could keep the army busy while the Communists became accepted into mainstream Indonesian politics, which the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) found favourable. The nationalist-leaning army was content to fight the Malaysians to both remove British influence from the region as well as to establish Indonesian dominance in Southeast Asia. Some of the military high command thought that conflict could solidify a central role for the army in Indonesian politics, as well as increase their budget and return the country to martial law, which would greatly empower the military. Short of all-out war, the military was largely supportive of Confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E

25|$|After the War of 1812 and the British blockade, the American whaling {{industry}} slackened {{for a while}} {{but then}} revived in the 1830s. This economic boom manifested itself architecturally with the Greek Revival. Many were built, including a large concentration on Columbia Street east of Park Place. Notable single examples are the ornate Curtis House at 32 Warren and the temple houses at 51 Partition Street and 738 Warren. Around 1850, <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> the Picturesque mode changed the city's architectural mix, integrating it more closely with the region, where the Carpenter Gothic style championed by Andrew Jackson Downing had first gained popularity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} Jews {{in the areas}} of modern-day Saudi Arabia dates back, by some accounts, to the time of the First Temple. Immigration to the Arabian Peninsula began in earnest in the 2nd century CE, and by the 6th and 7th centuries there was a {{considerable}} Jewish population in Hejaz, mostly in and around Medina, in part because of <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> Judaism by such leaders as Dhu Nuwas (who was very aggressive about converting his subjects to Judaism, and who persecuted Christians in his kingdom as a reaction to Christian persecution of Jews there by the local Christians and Abu Karib Asad.|$|E
25|$|The decisive {{pressure}} {{for a compromise}} solution on the Japanese side came from the Shōwa Emperor, who {{made it clear that}} he was displeased with the prospect of a war with Britain while the war with China was still unresolved and Japan on the brink of an all-out war with the Soviet Union. Additionally, he felt a war with Britain would push Japan too much into <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> Germany to the latter's advantage. Since he was worshipped as a living god by the Japanese people, the knowledge of his unhappiness about the Tientsin crisis was a powerful force for a peaceful resolution of the crisis within the halls of power in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. They said they would continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E

The monster motif also appears in tales of contemporary places outside the United States, such as Scotland, with its Loch Ness Monster.

500|$|Observers {{contend that}} Gibson's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> the Internet by the mainstream. Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the [...] "meatpuppet", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of virtual sex. His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design. Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the [...] "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking [...] "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?" ...|$|E
500|$|Whether any {{of these}} women could confirm their {{addresses}} for publication in Harris's List is something that author Sophie Carter doubts. [...] She views the annual as [...] "primarily a work of erotica", calling it [...] "nothing {{so much as a}} shopping list... textually arrayed for the delectation of the male consumer", continuing [...] "they [...] await his intervention to institute an exchange", epitomising the traditional male role in pornography. [...] Elizabeth Denlinger includes a similar sentiment in her essay, [...] "The Garment and the Man": [...] "This varied display of women to satisfy the 'great itch'... is a fundamental aspect of the sphere to which Harris's List offered British men a carte d'entrée". [...] Rubenhold writes that the variability in the descriptions of prostitutes over the years the list was published defy [...] "all attempts to categorise it as either exclusively up-market or simply middle of the road." [...] She suggests that the annual's purpose was to [...] "conduct the desirous to <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> a prostitute", and that its prose was designed for [...] "solitary sexual enjoyment" [...] (H. Ranger also sold back-issues of Harris's List). [...] Sold to a London public which was mostly patriarchal, its listings reflect the prejudices of the men who authored them. [...] They were therefore not representative of women generally, and as she concludes, [...] "it is likely that their stories would have differed quite significantly from those recounted by their customers {{for the benefit of the}} List's publishers." ...|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and <b>the</b> <b>embrace</b> <b>of</b> a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E
