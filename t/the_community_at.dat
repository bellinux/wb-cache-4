5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|M-183 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves Fayette State Park as an access route from US Highway 2 (US2). The highway runs through rural farmlands of the Garden Peninsula {{and next to}} Big Bay de Noc, a bay of Lake Michigan. <b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Fayette {{dates back to the}} 1860s. It has been a state park since the late 1950s, and the connecting road has been a state highway since the 1980s.|$|E

Large plazas also exist {{at some of}} the towns throughout the region, some around 490 ft across. [...] Many of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>at</b> Kuhikugu were linked, with roads which bridged some rivers along their paths, and with canoe canals running alongside some of the roads. [...] Fields of mandioca (cassava) may have existed around <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>at</b> Kuhikugu, suggesting that the people there were farmers. [...] Dams and ponds which appear to have been constructed in the area also suggest that the inhabitants of Kuhikugu may have been involved with fish farming, which is still practiced by some of their modern day Kuikuro descendants.|$|R

5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a small stream forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY284 ends in the center of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> a junction with US6.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, {{exactly a}} week after the {{shooting}} happened, five minutes of silence were observed from 3:06-3:11p.m. CST, accompanied by the tolling of bells throughout <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>at</b> a special ceremony attended by thousands in memory of the victims which was held at the MLK Commons. Moments of silence were also held elsewhere throughout the DeKalb community. There was a special memorial service held in the NIU Convocation Center on February 24, the day before classes resumed, in honor of the victims that initiated a set of activities and services aimed at community recovery. Due to the loss of one week of instructional time {{in the middle of the}} semester, an extra week was added in May.|$|E
5|$|The Bend {{remained}} an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years.

5|$|After {{ending his}} work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his {{attention}} to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near to Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Wheeler, Tessa, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum, Charles Drew, the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, the dig constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries. His excavation report was published in 1943 as Maidan Castle, Dorset. The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Maidan Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury {{retained}} as suffragans, or subordinates, {{the bishops}} of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield. This listing, however, comes from the Gesta pontificum Anglorum of the later medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury, written in about 1120. Although the division is logical, William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht's successor Ealdwulf, and does not give a source for his list, which suggest {{that it may be}} untrustworthy. The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial, and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that there were always some in the Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese.|$|E

5|$|During the {{peregrine}} falcon decline, Houle studied biology at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe {{peregrine falcon}} activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} town of Rush, NY251 widens from two to four lanes and meets I-390 at exit11. Just east of the freeway, NY251 intersects NY15, which is also served by exit11 {{by way of a}} pair of short collector/distributor roads {{paralleling}} I-390 from NY251 to NY15. Past NY15, the route reverts to a two-lane highway and veers southeast to parallel Honeoye Creek into the hamlet of Rush. Here, the route passes through a more populated area as it intersects NY15A in the center of <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>at</b> which point it becomes Rush–Mendon Road. NY251 continues to follow Honeoye Creek through progressively less developed areas and into the town of Mendon, where the creek curves southward toward Honeoye Falls at Rochester Junction. The highway, however, turns northeastward to meet NY65 at a roundabout. The northeasterly routing of NY251 continues to Mendon Center, a small hamlet near the southern tip of Mendon Ponds Park, where it turns eastward once more.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes {{through the center of the}} village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> <b>At</b> the rail crossing, the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Iona.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{returned}} to England in 958 {{at the behest}} of his uncle, but Oda died before Oswald returned. Lacking a patron, Oswald turned to Oskytel, recently named Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald along with Oskytel travelled to Rome for Oskytel's pallium, but this story is only contained in a 12th-century Ramsey Abbey chronicle, so it may not be authentic. Even if he did not travel to Rome, Oswald was active in ecclesiastical affairs at York until Dunstan obtained Oswald's appointment to the see, or bishopric, of Worcester. He was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. Soon after his consecration, he persuaded Germanus to come back to England and made him head of a small religious community near Westbury-on-Trym. After the establishment of this group about 962, Oswald grew worried that because the monastery was located on lands owned by the see of Worcester, his successors in the see might disrupt the community. He was offered the site of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire by Æthelwine, son of Æthelstan Half-King, and Oswald established a monastery there about 971 that attracted most of the members of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Westbury. This foundation at Ramsey went on to become Ramsey Abbey. Ramsey was Oswald's most famous foundation, with its church dedicated in 974. Later, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury to come and teach at Ramsey. Oswald directed the affairs of Ramsey Abbey until his death, when the dean Eadnoth became the first abbot. He gave a magnificent Bible to Ramsey, which was important enough to merit a mention in Oswald's Life. Alongside the gift of the book, Oswald also contributed wall hangings and other textiles to the abbey.|$|E
