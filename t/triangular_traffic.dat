40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} {{computer}} vision based method for {{traffic sign detection}} recognition and tracking based on the color {{and shape of the}} road sign and its geometric attributes. The study of traffic sign detection has been of great interests and often addressed by a three-stage procedure involving detection, tracking and classification. Road safety is an issue of national concern and its impacts is on the economy, public health and the general welfare of the people. We report on-going efforts to develop an intelligent agent for detecting and tracking traffic signs for vision based Driver Assistance System (DAS). Initially paper describes general framework for traffic sign detection and their important subsystems. Generally, computer vision techniques consist of three important stages, color segmentation, sign detection and classification. We explore the important sub-systems of each of these stages, and identify their advantages and disadvantages. We propose a system based on the framework to detect circular and <b>triangular</b> road <b>traffic</b> signs making use of artificial intelligence techniques such as heuristics functions for detecting shapes. System is implemented in real time environment and tested on national highway and aims to help vehicle driver to have safer and enjoyable driving thereby concentrating on his actual workload.

40|$|Nonlinear {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) dynamic {{finite element}} (FE) analyses {{are carried out}} to examine the structural performance of a pavement foundation system with and without the presence of geosynthetic reinforcement. Preliminary analyses are aimed at constructing a realistic finite element model representing a conventional pavement system in terms of geometry, loading system, boundary conditions and materials mechanical behavior. The dynamic implicit mode is used to handle dynamic equilibrium equations of the pavement system under <b>traffic</b> <b>triangular</b> wave load. Different strategies and provisions are made for considering the domain dimensions, choice of mesh and the constraints. In these preliminary analyses, the asphalt concrete (AC) viscoelastic behavior, the elastoplastic and elastoplastic strain hardening behavior of the base and subgrade, {{in addition to the}} linear elastic material of each layer are all covered in details and tested for the suggested finite element mesh. As a result of such analyses, a linear elastic asphalt concrete layer resting on a Drucker-Parger granular base underlined by a Cam Clay subgrade are adopted for conducting the parametric studies for reinforced and unreinforced conventional pavement systems. For the unreinforced systems, the results show that the subgrade strength has a significant effect on the pavement system rutting and little effect on its fatigue For the geosynthetic reinforced pavement system analyses, it is found that the geosynthetic placed at the bottom of AC leads to the highest fatigue resistance...|$|R

The Memorial is a gateway to a new public park {{adjacent}} to the former St. Vincent's Hospital which housed the City's first and largest AIDS ward and which is often considered the symbolic epicenter of the disease, figuring prominently in The Normal Heart, Angels in America, and other important pieces of literature and art that {{tell the story of the}} plague years in New York.|$|E
50|$|The statue was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} street at the intersections of Lincoln, Lawrence, and Western Avenues in a <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> island. However, the three-street intersection coupled with its heavy traffic load and the statue's presence was problematic, and made it among Chicago's three most dangerous intersections: in 1975 alone, the intersection accounted for 109 automobile accidents. Late in 1978 or early in 1979, the statue was moved approximately 50 feet east to its present location, which is at, but no longer in, the redesigned intersection of Lawrence and Western Avenues: it now sits in front of a local Walgreens.|$|E
5000|$|Tuxen embraced Ebenezer Howard's idea of {{the garden}} city. He {{incorporated}} the environment into his design, rather than imposing the development on the topography of the site. The {{idea of the}} garden city and the utilisation of the natural environment are evident in Tuxen's 1923 design of the Ranelagh Estate, on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. The estate had [...] "distinctive long curved roads, recreation reserves, internal reserves, and spacious <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> islands, which were designed to harmonise with the topography of the land". The idea of Howard's garden city was also evident in Saxil's 1925 design of Park Orchards, in Melbourne.|$|E

50|$|During the 1890s Bristol's tramway {{system was}} {{expanded}} and electrified. In 1895 the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company (BT&CC) moved their head office to premises at 1-3 St Augustine's Parade (where they remained until 1970). The {{need for a}} central interchange was recognised and to this end a large <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> island, later nicknamed 'Skivvy's Island' because of its use by domestic servants, was built between the BT&CC offices and St Augustine's Bridge. The Tramways Centre became {{the most important of}} the BT&CC's three central termini, serving more routes than the others at Bristol Bridge and Old Market. It was the terminus for trams from the north and east of the city, and trams from Hotwells to Temple Meads and Brislington also stopped here. Passengers could straightforwardly alight from one tram and board another to continue their journey without the need to cross roads. A large three-faced ornamental clock was fixed high on the Tramways offices, and 'under the clock on The Centre' became a popular meeting place.|$|E
5000|$|With the 1862 {{opening of}} the Sea Point tramline, the area became Cape Town's first [...] "commuter suburb", though the line linked {{initially}} to Camps Bay. At {{the turn of the}} century, the tramline was augmented by the Metropolitan and Suburban Railway Company, which added a line to the City Centre. During the 1800s, Sea Point's development was dominated by the influence of its most famous resident, the liberal parliamentarian and MP for Cape Town, Saul Solomon. Solomon was both the founder of the Cape Argus and the most influential liberal in the country - constantly fighting racial inequality in the Cape. His Round Church (St John's) of 1878 reflected his syncretic approach to religion - housing 4 different religions in its walls, which were rounded to avoid [...] "denominational corners". [...] "Solomon's Temple", as it was humorously known by residents, stood on its <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> island at the intersection of Main, Regent and Kloof roads, a centre of the Sea Point community, until it was destroyed by the city council in the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 the two {{quarries}} on Rollstone Hill began {{removing the}} final section of the hill between them where the Rollstone boulder was perched. At the urging of state representative Louis N. M. Des Chenes, the mayor of Fitchburg, Joseph N. Carriere, forced the quarries to halt operations so the boulder could be removed. The plans for moving the boulder were fairly simple as all {{that seemed to be}} holding the stone together was the iron band encircling it. The plan was to remove this band and the subsequent pieces the boulder crumbled into were to be moved to a small <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> island in downtown Fitchburg to be reassembled. Lines and numbers were painted on the Rollstone Boulder and it was meticulously photographed and drawn so that it could be reassembled exactly {{the same as it was}} before the move. After all this planning and documentation, when the iron band was removed the boulder did not fall apart. It took multiple blasts with black powder to even crack the stone. After it was broken into smaller pieces, they were all transported to its new home.|$|E
5000|$|The {{assassination}} {{took place}} in Prague 8, at a hairpin turn created by the junction of [...] (Avenue) and [...] (Avenue). This site was chosen because the hairpin turn required Heydrich's driver to slow down when negotiating this turn, thereby creating a favorable opportunity for an ambush. The actual site of the assassination was the site chosen for the memorial.In the intervening years, the local geography has greatly changed. [...] no longer intersects [...] Although {{there is still a}} junction in the same place, it is formed by [...] and two access ramps of the surrounding traffic interchange, the three roads together forming a <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> island inside the hairpin turn where [...] formerly intersected [...] Because the memorial was to be located amidst several busy thoroughfares, its most numerous and frequent observers would be the occupants of passing vehicles; this therefore became a very important factor in determining the proper scale for the memorial. The area surrounding the base of the sculpture has been designed so that the memorial integrates with the existing features of the parterre in a very natural manner. This area now consists of long, narrow concrete slabs, separated by narrow strips of earth, allowing grass to grow between the slabs. The greenery bursting through the concrete slabs not only integrates the memorial into the site, but also emphasises the vital spirit of the memorial and the events it commemorates. There is a memorial plaque {{directly in front of the}} sculpture. The whole composition escalates towards the sculpture. The ample space offered by this design enables the site to serve as a dignified gathering place for those wishing to remember the sacrifices made by the participants in Operation Anthropoid, as well as those who may gather for any solemn occasion.|$|E

Briggs, Chair“The <b>Triangular</b> <b>Traffic</b> in Women, Plants, and Gold: On the Interoceanic Road in Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia” {{focuses on}} Peru’s Amazonian region of Madre de Dios. Situated near {{the borders of}} Brazil and Bolivia, this region has earned the {{nickname}} “El Wild Wild West” for the implosion of lawlessness and prostitution reminiscent of the North American gold rush. With {{the fall of the}} dollar and international rise in the price of gold, Madre de Dios has seen a massive migration of people—male gold miners and female sex-workers, initially from the Andes. Now men and women from Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil also {{make their way to the}} mines. This dissertation examines the <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> in women destined for the sex-trade, plants employed for reproductive health – often en route to pharmaceutical analysis, and the gold, brought into solid form via mercury that fuels interdependent economies. “Mines are like women,” went a common refrain in the illegal rainforest gold mines, “because both are for exploitation,” placing the investigation of what constitutes “the human” and human-environmental interactions into the realm of human-environmental extraction. From rainforest to laboratory, brothel to bank, “traffic” depicts physical encounters, collisions, and jams, as well as functioning as an analytic to examine entwined questions of (non) human vitality and the dynamic value of people and things traveling across borders and through global commodity-chains...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} an efficient method {{for the detection}} of <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> signs on grey-scale images. This method is based on the proposed RSLD (RANSAC Symmetric Lines Detection) algorithm which transforms triangle detection into a simple segment detection. A multi-scale approach allows the detection of any warning and yield traffic signs, whatever their distance to the vehicle. This algorithm is applied to a set of selected corners obtained with a coding gradient method. Baseline detection uses the scale of selected triangles to confirm the presence of traffic signs. The study demonstrates that RSLD is a low computation method compared to standard triangle detection. The performance of the method proposed is compared with recently published methods on road sign databases, which use colour information. An equivalent detection rate is obtained with this algorithm, working on grey-scale images. This algorithm is implemented and runs in real time at 30 frames per second...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traffic Congestion Management (TCM) in a {{megacity}} like Kinshasa, {{capital of}} the DR Congo, is a knowledge and real life problem of complex nature. Here, the authors describe the TCM problem through 9 phases of the layer 1 of the COMPRAM methodology. TCM is a worldwide complex societal problem and specifically in Kinshasa where it presents a set of characteristics such as ‘chaotic’ driver behaviour, road potholes and the road network physiognomy doesn’t respond to the supply- versus demand-side equation. The other complex problems include the absence of road planning with consideration to demographic parameters and car ownership increase, no suitable traffic operations infrastructure and limited funds for both maintaining existing roads and building additional ones. To solve this TCM problem, the authors propose a TTCMP (<b>Triangular</b> <b>Traffic</b> Congestion Management Process) framework as an output based layer 1 of COMPRAM by identifying types and sources of congestion, followed by a TCM problem description {{and a set of}} technical elements for ‘curbing’ traffic congestion with an overview on a Bluetooth based technology for traffic data collection as an adapted ICT 4 D solution for a low-income city like Kinshasa...|$|E
40|$|Understanding traffic statics and {{dynamics}} in urban networks {{is critical to}} develop effective control and management strategies. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to study the traffic statics {{and dynamics}} in a signalized double-ring network, which can provide insights into the operation of more general signalized traffic networks. Under {{the framework of the}} link queue model (LQM) and the assumption of a <b>triangular</b> <b>traffic</b> flow fundamental diagram, the signalized double-ring network is studied as a switched affine system. Due to periodic signal regulations, periodic density evolution orbits are formed and defined as stationary states. A Poincaré map approach is introduced to analyze the properties of such stationary states. With short cycle lengths, closed-form Poincaré maps are derived. Stationary states and their stability properties are obtained by finding and analyzing the fixed points on the Poincaré maps. It is found that a stationary state can be asymptotically stable, Lyapunov stable, or unstable. The impacts of retaining ratios and initial densities on the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and the gridlock times are analyzed. Multivaluedness and gridlock phenomena as well as the unstable branch with non-zero average network flow-rates are observed on the MFDs. With long cycle lengths, fixed points on the Poincaré maps are solved numerically, and the obtained stationary states and the MFDs are very similar to those with short cycle lengths. Compared with earlier studies, this paper provides an analytical framework {{that can be used to}} provide complete and closed-form solutions to the statics and dynamics of double-ring networks. This can lead to a better understanding of how the combination of signalized intersections and turning maneuvers is expected to impact network properties, like the MFD.
