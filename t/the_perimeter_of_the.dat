5|$|Bowes Castle was {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village}} of Bowes in County Durham, England. Built within <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Roman fort of Lavatrae, the early timber castle on the site was {{replaced}} by a more substantial stone structure between 1170 and 1174 on the orders of Henry II. A planned village was built alongside the castle. Bowes Castle withstood Scottish attack during the Great Revolt of 1173-74 but was successfully looted by rebels in 1322. The castle went into decline and was largely dismantled after the English Civil War. The ruins are now owned by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover {{that it was just}} as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Marine General Rathvon M.

Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position.
