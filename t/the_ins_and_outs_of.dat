500|$|After a few months, Elgar {{left the}} {{solicitor}} {{to embark on}} a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's shop. He was {{an active member of the}} Worcester Glee club, along with his father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the country, but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist. At twenty-two he took up the post of conductor of the attendants' band at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum in Powick, [...] from Worcester. The band consisted of: piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and piano. Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, including quadrilles and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. The Musical Times wrote, [...] "This practical experience proved to be of the greatest value to the young musician. ... He acquired a practical knowledge of the capabilities of these different instruments. ... He thereby got to know intimately the tone colour, <b>the</b> <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> these and many other instruments." [...] He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to Powick once a week. Another post he held in his early days was professor of the violin at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.|$|E

[...] Despite the influx of the Fraser Gold Rush in 1858–59, settlement on Burrard Inlet and English Bay was almost unknown prior to the early 1860s {{due in large part}} to the lack of interest in the area as the access to the BC interior was via the City of New Westminster and the Fraser River and also due to the power of the Squamish chiefs over the area. Robert Burnaby and Moberly camped and prospected for coal in what is now Coal Harbour in Vancouver in the summer of 1859. In general they got along fine with the native people. Robert Burnaby wrote [...] "Our [...] time has been occupied in exploring all <b>the</b> <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> this Inlet, which I prophesy [...] will become one of the greatest naval rendezvous and centres of commerce on this side of the world."

2500|$|In 2009, {{after years}} of trying to persuade the Conservative {{movement}}’s Rabbinical Assembly that the movement needed a stronger presence in the nation’s capital, the group made the decision to appoint a Director of Public Policy, turning to Moline to serve in that position as a volunteer. He had argued that other Jewish movements had such a presence, such as the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and the Orthodox Union’s Institute for Public Affairs, both of which are “active players in the capital.” [...] Understanding that there is a “diverse RA membership behind him and an even more diverse population of Conservative Jews,” Moline’s responsibilities were expected to focus on “broad consensus positions of the movement and on laying out broad principles based on Conservative thinking.” However, as one Washington Jewish Week article noted, “… he is also an experienced Washington player; a lot of the new Conservative movement’s impact may be under the radar with Moline at the helm.” Rabbi Jeffrey Wohlberg, then President of the Rabbinical Assembly, praised the choice of Moline for the new position, saying that “Rabbi Moline is that perfect combination of smart, well-connected, socially-savvy and thoroughly conversant on the issues of the day.
