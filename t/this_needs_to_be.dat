25|$|Critical {{understanding}} is a cerebral mode of comprehension, it {{is a way}} of thinking, and thus is not dependent upon external expression.

25|$|Before European {{settlement}} in Australia, Indigenous Australians managed the land using fire.

25|$|Compared {{to flush}} toilets {{connected}} to sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants, UDDTs are usually less expensive. However, to enable accurate comparisons of costs, <b>this</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assessed {{on a case-by-case}} basis because the sewer system and treatment plant also transports and treats greywater whereas the UDDT does not. This means that the two systems provide a different level of service to the user. An example calculation for such a cost comparison exists for the case of Lima, Peru.|$|E

The defendant must explain why the use of letters rogatory or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} costing/valuation {{of inventory}} can be complex. Whereas {{in the past}} most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). <b>This</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision {{since there is no}} market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.|$|E
25|$|To {{realize a}} {{democracy}} {{in the workplace and}} the abolition of wealth and poverty, Unger argues for the need to relate the program of worker community and democracy with an enlargement of democracy at the national level—the goal cannot be only one of economic production and worker's rights, but must be accompanied by a national project at the structural level. He pushes this idea further by calling not just for a restructuring {{of the relationship between the}} firm and state based on private property, but that it also has to be replaced with a new set of rights encompassing access to jobs, markets, and capital. Only as private rights are phased out can rights of decentralized decision making and market exchange be extended to workers. <b>This</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by limits on the size of enterprise and how profits are used to control others' labor.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, <b>this</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

2500|$|Common {{problems}} with all field emission devices, {{particularly those that}} operate in [...] "industrial vacuum conditions" [...] is that the emission performance can be degraded by the adsorption of gas atoms arriving from elsewhere in the system, and the emitter shape can be in principle be modified deleteriously {{by a variety of}} unwanted subsidiary processes, such as bombardment by ions created by the impact of emitted electrons onto gas-phase atoms and/or onto the surface of counter-electrodes. Thus, an important industrial requirement is [...] "robustness in poor vacuum conditions"; <b>this</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account in research on new emitter materials.|$|E
2500|$|The family, Histeridae, is very diverse, so {{different}} species {{can be found}} on the body at different times because of their various feeding habits. <b>This</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> noted when examining a dead body. [...] They are predacious beetles and arrive when there is material to feed on, like other beetles or maggots. They do not actually feed on the carrion. For example, Hister quadrinotatus and Hister sedakovi arrive to feed when the carrion is bloat to dry (full of maggots to no maggots). In contrast, Saprinus pennsylvanicus arrive at the body first, when it is fresh to late (beginning of decomposition to advanced decomposition).|$|E
