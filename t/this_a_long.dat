2500|$|Wei's {{work was}} also {{to have a}} later impact on Japanese foreign policy. In 1862, samurai Takasugi Shinsaku, from the ruling Japanese Tokugawa shogunate, visited Shanghai on board the trade ship Senzaimaru. Japan had been forced open by US Commodore Matthew C. Perry {{less than a decade}} earlier and the purpose of the mission was to {{establish}} how China had fared following the country's defeat in the Second Opium War (18561860). Takasugi was aware of the forward thinking exhibited by those such as Wei on the new threats posed by Western [...] "barbarians" [...] and later recorded in his diary: [...] "The philosophy of the Chinese people stands poles apart from the correct path for China's future development. They are infatuated with lofty words unrelated to reality." [...] Sinologist Joshua Fogel concludes that when Takasugi found out [...] "that the writings of Wei Yuan were out of print in China and that the Chinese were not forcefully preparing to drive the foreigners out of their country, rather than derive from <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> analysis of the failures of the Chinese people, he extracted lessons for the future of Japan". Similarly, after reading the Treatise, scholar and political reformer Yokoi Shōnan became convinced that Japan should embark on a [...] "cautious, gradual and realistic opening of its borders to the Western world" [...] and thereby avoid the mistake China had made in engaging in the First Opium War. Takasugi would later emerge as a leader of the 1868 Meiji Restoration which presaged the emergence of Japan as a modernised nation {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Yoshida Shōin, influential Japanese intellectual and Meiji reformer, said Wei's Treatise had [...] "made a big impact in our country".|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce the size of our army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E
