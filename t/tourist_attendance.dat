50|$|To {{survey the}} {{rockfall}} and {{determine how to}} prevent the falls from becoming a series of rapids, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completely blocked {{the flow of water}} over the American Falls from June to November 1969. Results conflict as to whether <b>tourist</b> <b>attendance</b> that season was higher or lower than normal. Attendance increases were likely due to the news that the cataract was dried off; decreases in tourists could be attributed to the fact people thought both cataracts (the American and Horseshoe Falls) were dewatered that year. By December 1969, water was flowing over the American Falls again. In the mid‑1970s, it was decided not to make alterations to the rockwall and remove the talus, citing the trend to allow nature to take its course.|$|E

[...] They were more thoroughly explored in 1904 by Revelstoke resident Charles Deutchmann, and were called both Cheop's Caves and Deutchmann Caves before being called Nakimu. Deutchmann {{signed a contract with}} Parks Canada to operate tours in the caves. A teahouse was constructed near the cave mouth and a road was built from the Illecillewaet River valley. During the heyday of Glacier House in the early 1900s, Deutchmann constructed a series of wooden stairs and boardwalks and the caves were visited heavily by tourists. The natural features were significantly damaged by human contact during the period. The Nakimu Caves had for a period what was considered the only true [...] "show" [...] cave among the Canadian national parks, although this section was closed in 1935 because of decreased <b>tourist</b> <b>attendance.</b> Parks removed the remnants of Deutchmann's construction, and closed the caves completely to all but experienced cavers with permits.|$|E

40|$|The nongated and {{multiple}} entry point character of many destinations {{makes it difficult}} to accurately estimate visitor attendance. This research describes a modeling procedure for credibly estimating <b>tourist</b> <b>attendance</b> in such destina-tions. It demonstrates the application of the approach in the mountain tourism destination of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. This article suggests that while the model is capable of providing timely and relevant attendance estimates for des-tination managers, its credibility is dependent on access to a substantive base of both audited attendance data concern-ing anchored visitors and specific behavioral information collected on a systematic basis from footloose visitors in the destination. The findings are offered as a contribution to the growing literature on tourism destination and special event visitor attendance estimation and performance assessment...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityBased on {{the field}} of {{cultural}} economics and economics of the visual arts, this dissertation focuses on microeconomics application to the market for fine arts. The first chapter investigates the relationship between the market value of a painting and the attributes of the painting and its artists. The artist's attributes are represented by the primary style and primary object of the artist significantly used in the artist's paintings. The results of the hedonic regression confirm that the market values the primary style and objects. The second chapter focuses on art museums and analyzes the effect of different types of art museums in terms of the admission policies on state residents and art visits in U. S. The study concludes that while free art is attractive for local participation, it might {{have a negative impact on}} <b>tourist</b> <b>attendance.</b> The results also show the importance of location for art museums. Finally, the third chapter analyzes premium rates and art investment by using auction sales data on impressionist and contemporary paintings. The study shows that paintings which are close to limit hammer prices tend to end up with high premium rates and low hammer prices. The art indexes that are captured from hedonic regressions show how investment on art changes with market in London and New York. Investment on impressionist and contemporary art between 2000 and 2012 in New York was relatively less risky than the market. However, investment on impressionist and contemporary art in London has no evidence for a risky investment. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|E

40|$|THE ISSUES IN METHODOLOGY AND DATA INTERPRETATION IN STUDIES OF <b>TOURIST</b> ATTRACTIONS' <b>ATTENDANCE</b> Lukáš Nekolný Abstract Attendance {{belongs to}} the main {{quantitative}} indicators of tourism {{which is one of}} the most important sectors of human activites. Knowledge about number of visitors has substantiation in scientific research and in destination management. In this case it is essential to combine the sustainability and the economic benefits. The number of visitors (visits) is important regarding to education and media. Therefore the use of comparable methodology is appropriate before interpretation of corresponding data. The aims of this thesis after analysing methodologic risk issues are to create the recommendation and to compare data of tourist attractions. The main points of recommendation we can mark are to compare individual attractions regardless of the ownership structure and to separate counting of tour routes and counting of visitor numbers with season tickets without distorted coefficients. All these issues are completed through the model cases from zoos - one of the most visited tourist attractions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} competitive equestrian sport <b>tourist</b> {{motivations for}} <b>attendance</b> at competitive events in regional Australia. A survey of participants attending three separate competitive equestrian events was conducted {{and the resultant}} data were analyised using basic statistical techniques. Additionally, independent t tests were applied to the 7 point Likert scale to compare the results based on day visit verses overnight stay, gender and purpose/discipline for attending (event type). The value of both sport and tourism orientated motives was considered. It was found that these sport tourists are quite homogenous demographically {{and to some extent}} also in relation to motivational drivers. For the most part these competitive sport tourists are motivated to attend these events by traditional extrinsic motives relating to competition and the standard of the competition-scape. Less important are extrinsic sport motives relating to social and relationship development and leisure and recreational motivational drivers for the most part are found to be of little influence on the decision to attend a competition/event. These results provide valuable insight for site/event management, tourism and local Government decision makers into this potentially large sport tourism market that is ideally suited to rural and regional areas. With supply side competition predicted to increase, improved knowledge and understanding of this sport tourism and event market is vital to maintain and improve competitive advantage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite the {{importance}} of the festivals for the culture and the economy of nations, little research has been conducted {{in order to understand the}} behaviour of the Romanian tourists regarding the festivalattendance and the intention to travel in order to participate in festivals. The originality of this study is highlighted by the analysis of the behaviour of Romanian <b>tourists</b> regarding the <b>attendance</b> at festivals, from the point of view of studying festival tourism as a form of cultural tourism. The article is based on the findings of an exploratory survey–based research carried out in February – May 2014. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the behaviour of the Romanian tourist regarding the participation in festivals, both in his town and also when he is travelling. Our objectives are to: find if Romanian people in general, and Romanian tourists, in particular, are interested in traveling with the purpose of attending a festival, identify the main motivations for attending a festival, the types of festivals that are preferred and the tourists ‘perception on Bucharest as potential international festival destination. The paper concludes that Romanian tourists tend to participate in one festival per year in average in their country and less than one festival per year in another countries, that music festival is the most appreciated type of festival and also we discovered that the most important motives for attending festivals in tourists’ perception are psychological, cultural and emotional...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gujo Odori, a Festival Gujo Odori is a Japanese Bon (festival for {{the dead}} usually held in midsummer), {{in this case a}} dance matsuri (festival) held {{annually}} in Gujo Hachiman, Gujo City, in Gifu Prefecture. Landlocked Gifu Prefecture, and even less Gujo City and the administrative district of Gujo Hachiman, are not too prominent in Japan’s consciousness, and are known primarily for the historic villages of Shirakawa-go and Gokayama, UNESCO WorldHeritage sites, and to some people for the ayu, the sweetfish found abundantly in its many rivers. Gujo Odori begins in mid-July, when the Hasshosai,the launching ceremony, is held in front of the old town hall plaza by shrine officials-the traditional sponsors- and local government representatives, with Gujo Hachiman residents and <b>tourists</b> in <b>attendance.</b> Every year, the politicians outnumber the shrine representatives at least ten to one. Aside from public administrative and festival committee officials, also present are members of different organisations such as the local education board,the chamber of commerce and the tourist association. From early September, during thirty-one selected days within a two-month period, townspeople and visitors dance a repertoire of ten short dances of varying rhythms, on themes ranging from history to agriculture to nature, {{in different parts of the}} town selected forhistoric, and other more mundane reasons, such as easy access and capacity. Although Gujo Hachiman has a population of less than 17, 000, on festival days the number of people more than doubles, and during the Tetsuya Odori (all-night dancing), a period of four daysfrom the 13 th to 16 th August - conveniently co-inciding with the Bon holiday in Japan - the crowds swell to four times the number of residents (Gujo City, 2006), all contributing activity and profit to the festivities. Like most Japanese festivals of ancient provenance,the origins of Gujo Odori are hazy. The first historical appearance of the name Gujo Odori was in 1914, when it was the name of one type of dance performed in celebration of the opening of the new town hall. In 1923,the Gujo Odori Hozonkai (Gujo odori dance preservationsociety), an organization formed one year earlier and still existing today, formally established the repertoire of dances, naming the whole set Gujo Odori in a pamphlet printed to promote the dance (Gujo Odori hensan iinkai, 1993). This eponymous pamphlet also contained the first known historical account of Gujo Odori, which dated the origin of the dance to the late 16 th century, around 1590,when local clan leaders supposedly instructed the inhabitants of Hachiman to perform dances to honour deities to thank them for victory in war, or maybe for good harvests. Thus, in 1991 the festival celebrated its 400 th-year ‘anniversary’ in 1991. However, Gujo Odori is not merely a huge festival in a small town. Since 1997, the Japanese Government has designated Gujo Odori as an ‘Important Intangible Folk-Cultural Property,’ one among 246 such Properties (Agency for Cultural Affairs, 2006). Previously, it was a‘National Folk-Art Intangible Cultural Property,’designated in 1973, before its present category was created. This paper, through the example of designated intangible heritage, specifically Gujo Odori in Gifu Prefecture, will discuss significant issues that characterise the field of intangible cultural heritage in Japan...|$|R
