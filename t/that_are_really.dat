[...] Discussing the difference between art films and big-studio films, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series {{as an example of}} both; he has described Memento and Inception as [...] "masterworks". Nolan has also been commended by James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, Matt Reeves, Danny Boyle, Wong Kar-Wai, Steven Soderbergh, Sam Mendes, Werner Herzog, Matthew Vaughn, Paul Thomas Anderson, Paul Greengrass, Rian Johnson, and others. Noted film critic Mark Kermode complimented the director for bringing [...] "the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking" [...] to Hollywood blockbusters, calling him [...] " [...] living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable".|$|E
500|$|All but {{two songs}} on the album were written by Corgan. The closing track from the first disc, [...] "Take Me Down", was written and sung by Iha, while the album's final track, [...] "Farewell and Goodnight", {{features}} lead vocals by all four band members and, according to the BMI database, was written solely by Iha, despite being credited on the album liner notes as being written by both Iha and Corgan. Iha wrote additional songs during {{the making of the}} album, but they did not make the final cut. Corgan said in a 1995 Rolling Stone interview, [...] "here are some B sides that James did <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> good. They just don't fit {{in the context of the}} album. And part of me feels bad. But over the seven years we've been together, the least uptight part of the band has been the music." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{began searching}} for a genre {{on which to base}} the soundtrack. They {{initially}} sought inspiration from the music of Richard Wagner, who was admired by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler. After studying Wagner's work, however, the team discovered that it didn't necessarily fit with the game's tone. They then searched for a style of music that would suit the Nazis, ultimately selecting distortion. [...] "There's lots of analogue distortion types, there's all sorts of different pedals and valves and things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> breaking up," [...] said Gordon. They also took inspiration from 1960s music, using analogue equipment such as tape machines and reel-to-reel machines. Gordon has said that the soundtrack is [...] "a tribute to all things guitar". In collaboration with each other, the team of musicians composed over six hours of music which scores the game. Matthies said, [...] "A lot of the score features odd time signatures yet it's all very groovy." ...|$|E

500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which Austen's novels are {{realistic}} is vigorously debated by scholars. The lack of physical description in her novels lends them an air of unreality. In Austen novels, as Page notes, there is a [...] "conspicuous absence of words referring to physical perception, the world of shape and colour and sensuous response". Yet, Austen carefully researched the background of her novels, using almanacs and read books to accurately describe the chronology and geography of her fictional worlds. Alastair Duckworth argues that she displays [...] "a concern that the novelist should describe things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> there, that imagination {{should be limited to}} an existing order." [...] Austen's prose also repeatedly contains [...] "a relatively small number of frequently-used words, mainly epithets and abstract nouns indicating personal qualities—qualities, that is, of character and temperament rather than outward appearance". This allows readers to feel as if they know the characters [...] "intimately as a mind". Many scholars view this connection between the reader and character as a mark of realism. For example, Janet Todd writes that [...] "Austen creates an illusion of realism in her texts, partly through readerly identification with the characters and partly through rounded characters, who have a history and a memory." [...] However, there is little agreement regarding the depth of Austen's characters. Butler has argued that Austen is not primarily a realist writer because she is not interested in portraying the psychology of her heroines. Seeing Austen as a polemicist against sensibility, Butler argues that she avoided [...] "the sensuous, the irrational, [...] the involuntary types of mental experience because, although she cannot deny their existence, she disapproves of them." ...|$|E
