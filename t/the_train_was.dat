5|$|In 2010, one of {{the trains}} was re-themed to endorse Stride Gum. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> wrapped in Stride Gum advertisements, showing a {{different}} flavor of Stride gum on each car. The advertisements remained on the train for the entire 2011 season, but were removed {{before the start of}} the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2007 a record-breaking train left Paris Gare du Nord at 10:44 (09:44 BST) {{and reached}} London St Pancras in 2hours 3minutes 39 seconds; {{carrying}} journalists and railway workers. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> the first passenger-carrying arrival at St Pancras International station.|$|E
5|$|On 6January 1930, {{the rear}} {{carriages}} of a passenger train from Hastings to London were partially buried by a landslip near Wadhurst tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> divided {{and the front}} part continued on to Tunbridge Wells, where it arrived 100 minutes late.|$|E
50|$|Working on <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>was</b> dangerous, {{eight men}} working on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>were</b> killed in 1893 {{and two were}} injured. Two other employees, three {{passengers}} and two unrelated people off of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>were</b> also injured.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} used sparingly {{to avoid}} electrical breakdowns. From 1995 <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> used more intensively and second class was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Photos of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> {{noted as}} PTC {{collection}} H 1792 and 1793. A copy of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> available in Microsoft Train Simulator—link & photo ...|$|R
5|$|Since the Pioneer Zephyr {{was built}} of {{stainless}} steel, {{which is not}} as recyclable as aluminum, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> spared from the metal recycling drives of World War II. By contrast, Union Pacific's M-10000, built of aluminum, was scrapped in 1942 for the war effort, among other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The most {{decorated}} Australian Naval unit of World War One, however {{was not a}} ship at all, but the Royal Australian Navy Bridging Train, a land-based unit composed {{mostly of}} reservists which landed at Suvla Bay with the British IX Corps and was responsible for receiving, storing and distributing the supplies, including potable water, of the British troops at Suvla. Due to their position working the piers and landings at Suvla, <b>the</b> <b>Train</b> <b>was</b> the last Australian unit to depart the Gallipoli Peninsula. After Gallipoli, <b>the</b> <b>Train</b> <b>was</b> sent to the Middle East, where they made a second amphibious landing at the Battle of Magdhaba, before returning to Australia and being disbanded {{after a series of}} miscommunications during May 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequences}} {{involving the}} armoured train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, near Peterborough in the UK. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{composed of a}} British Rail Class 20 diesel-electric locomotive {{and a pair of}} BR Mk 1 coaches, all three heavily disguised to resemble a Soviet armoured train.|$|E
50|$|From Dibrugarh, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> pulled with 15909/15910 Avadh Assam Express to Samastipur {{and then}} <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> pulled by 55527/55528 Kamla Ganga Intercity Fast Passenger to Darbhanga.|$|R
50|$|When {{operating}} push-pull, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> can <b>be</b> {{driven from}} either the locomotive or the alternative cab. If <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> heading in <b>the</b> direction in which the locomotive end of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> facing, this is considered 'pulling'. If <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> heading in <b>the</b> opposite direction, this is considered 'pushing' and the motorman or engine driver {{is located in the}} alternative cab. This configuration means that the locomotive never needs to <b>be</b> uncoupled from <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and ensures fast turnaround times at a railway station terminus.|$|R
50|$|Passengers {{awaiting}} {{services at}} Ash Vale towards London or Ascot can check the final destination of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{by referring to}} the signal {{at the end of}} platform 1. If the 5 white directional lights <b>are</b> illuminated, then <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> going towards Ascot; whereas if they <b>are</b> not, then <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> going to London (A red light means <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> not going anywhere at the moment).|$|R
5|$|To {{stem the}} loss of {{passengers}} and resulting deficits, the B in the early 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to the Auto Train), and onboard movies, to attract more passengers. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E
5|$|Travelling through England (from Harwich to London), <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> hauled by No. 60163 Tornado, a British {{mainline}} {{steam locomotive}} built in 2008 by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, {{the construction of}} which began in 1994 and was completed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> second batch <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> {{numbered}} 341-26~341-30; <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renumbered from <b>trains</b> 2-77~2-81.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> {{owned by}} Karelian Trains, a 50-50 {{joint venture between}} VR Group (Finnish Railways) and Russian Railways (RZD). <b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> able to run on both Finnish and Russian tracks.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} test the {{function}} of the Sifa the driver must carry out a Sifa test run before <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> used in order to check that <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> automatically braked.|$|R
5|$|For the British leg, behind Tornado and her maroon support coach, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{headed by}} Pegasus, a cream and brown Pullman Bar Car {{incorporating}} the Trianon Bar, {{followed by the}} historic 1950s built red and cream The Royal Scot rake of British Railways Mark 1 passenger coaches of Riviera Trains. Pegasus was built in 1951 for the famous Golden Arrow boat train, and later rebuilt for heritage mainline use.|$|E
5|$|From {{the opening}} of the line, {{passenger}} stock consisted of 4-wheel carriages. In 1845, there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London, with half that number on Sundays. On 23June 1849, the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager. The train, consisting of the Royal Saloon, two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes. It was driven by James Cudworth, the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 70 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line again on 18December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor, Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise. The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> driven by William Jacomb, Resident Engineer of the LSWR, and Edgar Verringer, Superintendent of the LSWR. At Waterloo, driving of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> taken over by John Shaw, General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn, Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 105 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} named Maverick and Iceman, {{going along}} with the callsigns of the two pilots in the Top Gun film. For the 2010 season, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renamed Firehawk and Raptor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> {{painted in}} a sky blue and crystal white livery, {{reminiscent}} of the Ise-Shima ocean resort region. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> named for <b>the</b> Shima region, and kaze, Japanese for [...] "wind".|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of Class 351000 <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> built from 1993 to 1999 by Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries. Because of the flat front ends, <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> nicknamed [...] "flat face" [...] (납작이). <b>The</b> {{first generation}} <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> numbered 351-01~351-22; <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renumbered from <b>trains</b> 2-47~2-48, 2-50, 2-55~2-69, and 2-73~2-76.|$|R
5|$|Mullen's film debut {{was in a}} film by Phil Joanou called Entropy {{where he}} played himself {{alongside}} bandmate Bono. He played a thief in Man on the Train, which starred Donald Sutherland. Filmed in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, Man on <b>the</b> <b>Train</b> <b>was</b> released in 2011. The following year, {{it was announced that}} Mullen would appear in his second film, A Thousand Times Goodnight, starring Juliette Binoche. On 3 September 2013 the film won Special Grand Prix of the Jury at Montreal World Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 2013, {{suspicious}} luggage {{items were}} found inside the North bound train No. 616 toilet {{when it was}} heading towards THSR Hsinchu Station. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> stopped at THSR Taoyuan Station {{and all of the}} passengers were evacuated. Later, it was determined the luggage contained an unidentified liquid in cans, alarm clock and white particulate matter. The items were dismantled by the bomb squad and taken for further investigation. Two KMT legislators, Hsu Hsin-ying and Lu Shiow-yen, were on board.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 2007, a Green Line train {{carrying}} approximately 120 people derailed {{near the}} Mount Vernon Square station in downtown Washington. Trains were single-tracking at the time, and the derailment {{of the fifth}} car occurred where <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> switching from the south to northbound track. The crash injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel. At least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} diagram, the two ends of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> drawn as grey lines. Because {{the ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> {{stationary}} {{with respect to the}} observer on <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> these lines <b>are</b> just vertical lines, showing their motion through time but not space. The flash of light is shown as the 45° red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>are</b> at <b>the</b> same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{first batch}} <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> {{numbered}} 341-01~341-25; <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> renumbered from <b>trains</b> 2-30~2-46, 2-49, 2-51~2-54, 2-70~2-72.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, for Kennywood's 100th anniversary, the {{headlights}} {{on the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>were</b> restored when <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> themselves <b>were</b> refurbished.|$|R
5|$|On November 21, 1950, a {{westbound}} troop train, Passenger Extra 3538 West—consisting of the S-2-a class 2-8-2 {{steam locomotive}} 3538 and 17cars, {{about half of}} which had wood bodies with steel underframes—was travelling from Camp Shilo, Manitoba to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was carrying 23officers and 315men of 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) for deployment to the Korean War, a movement dubbed Operation Sawhorse. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> moving through the Rocky Mountains on the CNR transcontinental mainline. CNR Train No.2, the eastbound Continental Limited, consisted of the U-1-a class 4-8-2 steam locomotive 6004 and eleven all-steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Roller {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first roller coasters, where <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> {{attached to a}} wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden roller coasters are still being produced, steel roller coasters are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Surviving railway {{workers in}} the railyards {{at the heart of}} the {{disaster}} carried out rescue work, pulling people from the harbour and from under debris. The overnight train from Saint John was just approaching the city when hit by the blast but was only slightly damaged. It continued into Richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage. Passengers and soldiers aboard used the emergency tools from the train to dig people out of houses and bandaged them with sheets from the sleeping cars. <b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>was</b> loaded with injured and left the city at 1:30 with a doctor aboard, to evacuate the wounded to Truro.|$|E
30|$|The {{starting}} {{positions of}} <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> have <b>been</b> set randomly and route requirements {{have also been}} chosen randomly, ensuring the scanning of all possible states. The names and directions of <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> <b>are</b> defined as static functions, while the position of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> identified as a dynamic function. External functions {{have been used for}} nondeterministic behaviours mentioned.|$|R
30|$|Survey with {{questions}} concerning {{the degree to which}} they felt <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>was</b> effective, <b>the</b> potential for application of the learning to the workplace, and duration of the hands-on and <b>the</b> <b>training</b> <b>was</b> also carried out.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> {{propelled}} by drive tires {{because of the}} short distance of the two lifts. These tires vary in tread pattern. The main tread pattern is recycled rubber diamond cut. Some tires appear to not be spinning, but rather are speed monitors, which track how fast <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> being propelled, and depending on how fast <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> going, tells <b>the</b> other motors how fast to spin. If <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>is</b> going too fast, a fault will occur and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> will stop at the next possible stopping point. Each lift is 65 feet high; the first lift is a 20 degree incline, while the second lift is a 25 degree incline.|$|R
