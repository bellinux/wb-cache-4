40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} {{has been}} employed {{to observe the}} slip lines in deformed Al- 2 % Ge alloy samples. Slip lines have been observed in the as-quenched, partially-aged, fully-aged and over-aged states. The lines tend to traverse fairly straight paths {{in the case of}} quenched and partially-aged conditions. Fully-aged samples also reveal such straight running lines when tested at low-temperatures. However, the density of the lines generally decreases as the peak-aged state is approached. These results are in agreement with the idea that thermally activated shearing of the precipitates is occurring in the alloy aged up to peak-hardness. The irregular lines for the over-aged specimens support the view that the moving dislocations by-pass the precipitates during deformation. The influence of <b>test-temperature</b> on the appearance of slip traces has been briefly examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the fibre volume fraction and <b>test-temperature</b> on the transverse tensile properties of glass fibre reinforced epoxy is studied using experimental and numerical techniques. The numerical analyses are based on micromechanical models with square and hexagonal fibre packings. Special attention has been directed towards {{the identification of the}} necessary failure criteria. Using a von Mises failure criterion, an increase in transverse tensile strength is predicted at higher fibre volume fractions with both models. This is in good quantitative agreement with experimentally determined transverse flexural strengths. With decreasing test-temperatures, higher transverse strengths are obtained. This is primarily caused by the temperature dependence of the yield stress of the matrix. The counteracting {{influence of}} the residual thermal stresses and the temperature dependent matrix ductility consequently proved to be less significant for the transverse strength...|$|E
30|$|Forty-two {{concrete}} cylinder specimens, 150  mm {{in diameter}} and 300  mm in height, were cast from each mix (2 types of tests ×  7 temperatures ×  3 repetitions per <b>test-temperature</b> combination). The coefficient of variation of all the tests conducted on {{the same type of}} concrete at the same temperature and across all the temperature-concrete combinations were within 5  %. Compressive and split tensile strength tests were performed on the samples after being subjected to six different temperatures as described below. Samples from each mixture design were also tested as control (i.e., no temperature exposure). ASTM C- 39 (2014) and ASTM C- 496 (2011) were followed in compression and tensile tests that were performed in a universal testing machine with a loading rate of 1  mm/s. Data loggers were attached to the universal testing machine to record the displacements and loading.|$|E
40|$|In the {{temperature}} range 200 - 400 degree C the Ni-base superalloy, N 901, develops marked dynamic strain ageing effects in its tensile behavior. These include inverse strain rate sensitivity, especially in UTS values, strongly serrated stress-strain curves and a heavily sheared failure mode {{at the higher}} <b>test-temperatures.</b> As for steels these effects seem {{to be due to}} interactions between the dislocations and the interstitial carbon atoms present. The results of tensile and fatigue threshold tests carried out between 20 degree C and 420 degree C are reported and the fatigue behavior is discussed in terms of the effects of surface roughness induced closure, temperature and strain aging interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerospace}} {{as well as}} {{the automotive}} industry permanently intend to reduce the weight of applied structural materials. Therefore, γ-TiAl is an attractive material fulfilling that requirement due to its low mass density, generally, and good mechanical properties in the temperature range between 700 °C and 900 °C. However, application of titanium aluminides above 750 °C service temperature is limited by poor oxidation behaviour caused by formation of fast growing and porous titania. To decrease the oxidation rate of TiAl it is essential to prevent the formation of non-protective TiO 2 scales. In this study the affinity of titanium to oxygen was lowered by forming titanium silicides. Si-based coatings with a thickness of 10 µm were deposited on the TiAl substrate by means of magnetron sputter technique. The coating system had to be pre-treated to form thermodynamically stable titanium silicides. A detailed study of phase formation in bare γ-TiAl under various exposure conditions, such as oxygen and nitrogen partial pressure, temperature and time, led to an optimized pre-treatment process of 100 h at 1000 °C at 10 - 6 mbar. Thus no oxides and nitrides were formed during this procedure but phase alterations occurred caused by interdiffusion processes. Therefore this pre-treatment was successfully used to form titanium silicides in the coatings. Annealing at 1000 °C under high-vacuum conditions resulted in the formation of a Ti 5 Si 3 layer, whereas less thermodynamically stable titanium silicides (Ti 5 Si 4, TiSi and TiSi 2) formed when exposed to air at 750 °C for 100 h. With the latter pre-treatment, a mixed oxide scale was also found {{on the top of the}} coating. The oxidation behaviour of the pre-treated coatings on γ-TiAl was studied by cyclic testing at 900 °C and 950 °C in air. Phase formation and microstructure evolution of the samples were investigated after 10, 100 and 1000 cycles by SEM and EDX as well as XRD. Notably, the oxidation rate of the high-vacuum annealed samples is lower than that of the pre-oxidized ones. All specimens exceeded a lifetime of 1000 cycles at both <b>test-temperatures</b> at minimum. ...|$|R
