25|$|Two Border Patrol agents demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was from. He {{answered}} their question {{accurately and}} produced {{a copy of a}} form showing his admission into the U.S. as a refugee. The agents asked whether he had been fingerprinted and photographed through NSEERS ("Special Registration"). He answered, accurately, that he had not: refugees are exempt from that program. They arrested him.|$|E

When the court demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> obtained it, he refuses to cooperate and is sentenced to be pressed to death. The character is based on a real person of the same name, who was also pressed when he would not plead guilty to charges of witchcraft.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among the}} Post's {{anonymous}} sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant {{was identified as}} William Mark Felt, Sr., {{deputy director of the}} FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with Time magazine, the Washington Daily News and other publications.|$|E
500|$|Lisa is {{transferred}} to Walter's lab, where he gives her special drugs to extract Rusk's thoughts from her mind. Instead, Rusk gains control of Lisa's body and demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is. His description of the murderer leads them another naval officer, who tells them Rusk's physically abused wife Teresa (Annie Parisse) hired him for the murder. Believing that he has left her mind, they learn too late that Rusk is still in control of Lisa; he goes to exact revenge on Teresa, but is stopped by Peter before he can go through with the murder. Lisa is eventually able to purge Rusk from her consciousness. The final scene shows an unrelated car crash victim suddenly waking up, mumbling in Russian: [...] "My Star", the pet name Rusk called his wife, meaning that Rusk is back.|$|E

'There's no {{partridges}} {{about in}} May, Miss Luttrell,' said Mrs. Oswald, quietly smiling to {{herself at the}} fancy picture of Ernest seated in congenial converse with the Rector, Colonel Turnbull, and young Luttrell; 'but as to Mr. Le Breton, I DO happen <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he's</b> stopping, though it's not often that I know any Calcombe gossip, save and except what you're good enough to tell me when you drop in, ma'am; for Mr. Le Breton's stopping here, in this house, with us, ma'am, this very minute.' ...|$|R
50|$|As Roper watches, Rip {{kneels down}} by Maggie and {{examines}} {{the structure of}} the rope web. He chooses correctly and saves Maggie but before he can confront his adversary, Roper flees into the jungle. Rip decides the safest course is for all of them—he, Maggie and Darlene—to track Roper together, the better <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he's</b> at until they can reach the Hoop entry site. However, as they stand arguing the merits of such a decision it begins to rain, the storm escalating quickly into a flash flood.|$|R
500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush {{out of the station}} hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi was delighted with the race victory, praising his team for their work and hoped his recent form would continue into the season's following rounds. His team was concerned over his battery overheating; Buemi stated that he drove cautiously {{in the first few}} laps <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was and that he had the entire car package under control. Second-place finisher Vergne stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] because of his team being recently new having had no prior testing of his car and all new personnel and equipment. He said he corrected the problems he had in the season's first two races and felt certain that he would place his focus into winning races: [...] "I think the whole team did a fantastic job, working really, really hard, sometimes many hours overnight and in the end it paid off." [...] Di Grassi, who finished in third, said {{that it was a good}} day for his team although he acknowledged that he was not on the same pace levels as the e.Dams-Renault cars. He revealed that his first car had a large amount of oversteer and stated every smallest change would make a large difference in terms of the championship.|$|E
2500|$|After Game 4, Roenick {{told the}} media, [...] "It {{should have been}} a penalty shot, there's no doubt about it. I like Patrick's quote that he would've stopped me. I'd just want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was in Game 3, {{probably}} getting his jock out of the rafters in the United Center maybe." [...] Roy retorted with his now-famous line, ...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of other anachronisms in the events the movie Leopold recalls. For instance, when he awakens to find himself in Stuart's {{apartment}} and demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he's</b> being held, he tells Stuart [...] "As far as I'm concerned, you might be Jack the Ripper!" [...] These Whitechapel murders to which Leopold refers, however, took place between 1888 and 1891, and so, much too late for Leopold <b>to</b> <b>know</b> of them. Also, Leopold mentions having seen the premiere of the Pirates of Penzance [...] "last month" [...] (March 1876), though Penzance actually had its world premiere in New York City on 31 December 1879.|$|R

2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do not want to know who took him. We just want to know, even anonymously, where he is," [...] she said.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Herbert Gussett is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who is forever sending [...] "Dear Sir" [...] {{letters to the}} Press, usually The Daily Telegraph or the Daily Express.

50|$|The {{battle that}} ensues is intervened by the Thor who {{attacked}} Logan earlier, {{and as she}} argues with Apocalypse, Logan flees and hides. The Thor then demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had run, but no one answers. Angry, she attacks both the X-Men and the Horsemen with a lightning bolt and then looks for Logan through the domain. When she is near the domain's walls, Logan climbs it and attacks her from behind. Enraged, the Thor attacks him with another lightning bolt and lets him fall into the neighboring domain of Technopolis, as she is attacked by Apocalypse's Infinite Soldiers. Logan is taken to Stark Tower by Baron Stark and Grand Marshal Rhodes, the Thor of that domain. After healing from his injuries, Logan awakens only to find himself in a totally different domain from the one <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was. He ends up fighting Rhodes but is defeated {{and sent to the}} Deadlands as punishment for breaking Doom's laws.|$|R
