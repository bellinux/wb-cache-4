50|$|<b>Tyrosol</b> {{present in}} wine is also {{shown to be}} cardioprotective. Samson et al. has shown that tyrosol-treated animals showed {{significant}} increase in the phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS and FOXO3a. In addition, <b>tyrosol</b> also induced the expression of longevity protein SIRT1 in the heart after myocardial infarction in a rat MI model. Hence tyrosol's SIRT1, Akt and eNOS activating power adds another dimension to the wine research, because it adds a great link to the French paradox. In conclusion these findings suggest that <b>tyrosol</b> induces myocardial protection against ischemia related stress by inducing survival and longevity proteins that may be considered as anti-aging therapy for the heart.|$|E
