40|$|Purpose: Researchers {{have used}} {{unscheduled}} <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> {{for many years}} during clinical trials to measure adult stuttering severity before and after treatment. Because variability is a hallmark of stuttering severity with adults, it is questionable whether an unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> is truly representative of their everyday speech. Method: The authors studied the speech of 9 men and 1 woman for a 12 -hr day during different speaking activities. On that day and 1 week prior to that day, participants received an unscheduled 10 -min <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from a person unknown to them. The authors compared the percent syllables stuttered (%SS) for the unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> on the day to the %SS of the unsch eduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> 1 week prior to the day and to the %SS during the entire day. Results: No significant differences were found, and all confidence intervals with t tests included 0. The concordance correlation test also showed a strong positive correlation between %SS scores for the entire day and for the unscheduled 10 -min <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b> Conclusion: The authors conclude {{that there is no}} reason to doubt that 10 -min unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> are a representative speech sample for %SS during clinical trials of stuttering treatments...|$|R

40|$|Telephone triage is an {{essential}} component of today’s oncology practice, and it has grown in importance as the care of patients with cancer has transitioned from the inpatient to the outpatient setting in the last 20 years.
