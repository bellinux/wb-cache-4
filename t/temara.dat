2500|$|Following the {{terrorist}} attack in Casablanca in May 2003, human rights groups accused Morocco of mistreating [...] and torturing detainees. Some Moroccan and international media have also alleged {{that the country has}} established CIA internment camps ("black sites") on its territory, inside <b>Temara</b> interrogation centre where human rights violations are committed.

2500|$|In March 2002, Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen with Moroccan origins, {{was arrested}} in Pakistan and {{subsequently}} interrogated by Pakistani and US officials. He was then rendered to Moroccan authorities, detained and tortured in a secret <b>Temara</b> interrogation centre. He was finally released without any charges brought against him, before being rearrested in May 2003 at the border crossing of the Spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa. He is currently imprisoned in Äin Bourja prison in Casablanca after having been sentenced to nine years in January 2004 for membership of a subversive organisation and for activities including holding unauthorised meetings. This in spite of conclusions in September 2006 by Italian Justice, after a five years investigation, that there was [...] "an absolute lack of grounds of evidence of charge which {{may be used in}} trial" [...] and that the suspicion motivating the inquiries had proved unfounded. Nonetheless, allegations in the Italian press and the judicial proceedings that were underway in Italy influenced court proceedings against Britel in Morocco that led to him being sentenced. MPs from Italy and from the European Parliament are set to ask the Moroccan Royal Cabinet to grant a pardon to the Italian citizen. According to the European Parliament Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transport and the Illegal Detention of Prisoners headed by rapporteur Giovanni Claudio Fava, documents demonstrated that [...] "the Italian judicial authorities and the Italian Ministry for Home Affairs (the latter, acting on behalf of the Direzione Centrale della Polizia di Prevenzione cited in connection with the investigation by the Divisione Investigazioni Generali ed Operazioni Speciali) cooperated constantly with foreign secret services and were well aware of all Britel's movements and whatever unlawful treatments he received, from the time of his initial arrest in Pakistan." ...|$|E
