5|$|Halfway through Gather Together, an {{incident}} occurs <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> {{the different ways}} in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism. Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior was dangerous. Rita's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects were enough to trigger the {{downfall}} of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. <b>That</b> <b>demonstrates</b> Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E

25|$|However, unlike {{transcendental}} Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places {{priority on}} existence (as opposed to essence), {{making it an}} existential Thomism <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> consonance with the Thomism of Étienne Gilson. It {{should be noted that}} the phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute idealism. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.|$|E

The student must then sight read a piece selected by the staff member responsible for their respective section to demonstrate the student's ability to pick up pieces quickly, as there is limited time to prepare the band's repertoire during the season. Staff members score both prepared and sightread performances, which are then tallied and ranked to assist the staff and section leaders in making final cuts.|$|E

25|$|At a {{time when}} the {{remaining}} architectural structures of the Roman Empire were falling into decay and much of its learning and technology lost, the building of masonry domes and the carving of decorative architectural details continued unabated, though greatly evolved in style since the fall of Rome, in the enduring Byzantine Empire. The domed churches of Constantinople and Eastern Europe were to greatly affect the architecture of certain towns, particularly through trade and through the Crusades. The most notable single building <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> this is St Mark's Basilica, Venice, but there are many lesser-known examples, particularly in France, such as the church of Saint-Front, Périgueux and Angoulême Cathedral.|$|E

Along with these completely manual gear hobs will be samples {{of some of the}} first semi-automated gear hobs, and finally examples of more recent technology <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> the fully automated process that modern gear hobs use to produce gears today. A few producers of gear hobs also have interesting literature on the history of gear hobs, including details about how modern gear hobs can produce thousands of gears in a single hour.|$|E
25|$|There is {{compelling}} {{evidence that the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS sensitization process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization. In addition, there is experimental evidence <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, {{it has also been}} hypothesized that a variety of immune processes may contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all concepts that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.|$|E

25|$|The Betawi {{culture is}} {{distinct}} {{from those of the}} Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi have moved to the suburbs of Jakarta, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang-based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of Tanjidor (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music), Marawis (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or Gambang Kromong (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese also influenced Betawi culture, such as the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers, to Betawi wedding attire <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> Chinese and Arab influences.|$|E
25|$|Many regiments of the Canadian Army {{have also}} been granted {{the use of the}} prefix royal in the regiment's name, while others bear the name of a member of the Royal Family. The royal prefix—termed a royal designation—is an honour <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> royal favour for the {{organisation}} to whose name the prefix is applied. Its award is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative and it does not expire unless revoked by the Crown-in-Council or the organisation that received the designation ceases to exist. If the name of the regiment should change after the prefix is granted, the word royal may be retained preceding the new name, such as when the Royal Northwest Mounted Police was renamed in 1920 as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.|$|E

25|$|The Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept was {{displayed}} in Sydney, Australia in 2016. Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis {{is another}} common {{autoimmune}} disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven {{amino acid sequence}} (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the α-subunit <b>that</b> <b>demonstrates</b> immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross-reactivity of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus {{is associated with the}} initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause immunologic cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.|$|E
