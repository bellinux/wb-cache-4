5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{and three}} {{associates}} were extradited to the United States. In a 77-page 32-count indictment filed on July 13, 2008 at {{federal court in}} Los Angeles, the Abergil family {{is considered one of}} the most powerful crime families in Israel, deriving that power, in part, “because of its propensity for violence in Israel and around the world.” They were charged with murder, laundering millions of dollars obtained from embezzlement at Israel <b>Trade</b> <b>Bank,</b> extortion of business people, and operating an ecstasy-distribution network for millions of ecstasy pills. The Abergils and their three associates have denied all charges. According to Israeli police sources, their crime organization has continued to operate in Israel after their extradition.|$|E
5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel <b>Trade</b> <b>Bank,</b> through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E

40|$|Under the strong-form {{of market}} discipline, {{publicly}} <b>traded</b> <b>banks</b> that have constantly available public market signals from their stock (and bond) prices would take less risk than non-publicly <b>traded</b> <b>banks</b> because counterparties, borrowers, and regulators could react to adverse public market signals against publicly <b>traded</b> <b>banks.</b> In comparing the credit risk, earnings risk, capitalization, and failure risk between publicly traded and non-publicly <b>traded</b> <b>banks,</b> {{the evidence in}} this paper rejects the strong-form of market discipline. In fact, the findings indicate that banking organizations tend to take more risk when they were publicly traded than when they were privately owned.

This chapter offers analytic scaffolding {{for thinking}} about the separation of <b>banking</b> and <b>trading.</b> <b>Banking</b> generates low risk returns from relationship-based activities; trading generates high-risk returns from short-term concentrated positions.

40|$|We analyze {{securities}} <b>trading</b> by <b>banks</b> {{during the}} crisis and the associated spillovers to the supply of credit. We use a proprietary data set that has the investments of banks at the security level for 2005 – 2012 {{in conjunction with the}} credit register from Germany. We find that—{{during the crisis}}—banks with higher <b>trading</b> expertise (<b>trading</b> <b>banks)</b> increase their investments in securities, especially in those that had a larger price drop, with the strongest impact in low-rated and long-term securities. Moreover, <b>trading</b> <b>banks</b> reduce their credit supply, and the credit crunch is binding at the firm level. All of the effects are more pronounced for <b>trading</b> <b>banks</b> with higher capital levels. Finally, banks use central bank liquidity and government subsidies like public recapitalization and implicit guarantees mainly to support trading of securities. Overall, our results suggest an externality arising from fire sales in securities markets on credit supply via the <b>trading</b> behavior of <b>banks...</b>|$|R
