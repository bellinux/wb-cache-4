25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Greeley's {{effectiveness}} as {{a reformer}} was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he [...] "must {{have looked like}} an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a farmer who came into town for supplies". [...] Van Deusen wrote, [...] "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. [...] Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ongoing}} The Books of Magic series, writer/artist Peter Gross {{played on the}} {{similarity}} to Potter, showing Tim's step brother Cyril putting on a glamor stone [...] <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like Timothy. Cyril then caught a train at platform 9½, implying {{that he was an}} alternate version of Harry Potter.|$|E

"Well, Bill {{was a bit}} flattered, the {{carpenter}} being a very superior sort of a man, and quite an artist in ’is way, an’ Bill sat down an’ let ’im do ’im with some stuff out of a can <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>’im</b> <b>look</b> like a Hindoo what ’ad been polished. Then Bob Pullin was done too, an’ when they’d got their turbins on, the change in their appearance was wonderful.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie {{watched his}} face as it took this outbreak, and the most she saw in it was that it turned a little white. <b>That</b> indeed <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look,</b> as Susan Ash would have said, queer; and it was perhaps {{a part of the}} queerness that he {{intensely}} smiled. [...] "You're too hard on Mrs. Beale. She has great merits of her own." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, film {{director}} David Lynch was interviewed on Dutch television about Loose Change, {{to which he}} said <b>that</b> the film <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> at what he thought he saw, that he now had questions and [...] "...no answers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Video games {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Noctis' character. Once Final Fantasy XV was {{revealed to the}} audience, Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network said that Noctis was [...] "your standard-issue brash anime kid in demeanor." [...] Daniella Lucas from GamesRadar compared him with Final Fantasy VIII main character, Squall Leonhart, based on his rebellious attitude as he lives [...] "by his own rules" [...] {{in contrast to the}} strict code of conduct set by his royal overseers. Similarly, Michelle Nguyen from Geek initially noted physical and mental similarities between Noctis and Narutos anti-hero and antisocial character, Sasuke Uchiha. However, she found Noctis was nicer but had a heavy burden <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> cold. Nguyen praised the way Noctis became friends with the other characters. Like Nguyen, David Roberts from GamesRadar enojyed Noctis' role in Brotherhood due to the way he develops to his relationships with his friends. Andrew Webster from The Verse noted while the characters appear to be cliche, the way Noctis became friends with them gave him a wish to play Final Fantasy XV and see how more do they develop.|$|E

50|$|As Caillou {{appeared}} as a much younger child in the original line of children's books, he originally had no hair. When illustrators found <b>that</b> adding hair <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> unrecognizable, {{it was decided that}} Caillou would never have hair.|$|R

5000|$|Grell's {{dislike of}} Tyroc {{was strong enough}} <b>that</b> he {{deliberately}} <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> ridiculous, saying, [...] "I gave him a silly costume.

60|$|Do not suppose, children, that he {{had been}} to a fortune-teller to inquire his destiny. It was his own energy and spirit of enterprise, and his {{resolution}} to lead an industrious life, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> forward with so much confidence to better days.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head mutinously, and the cloudy deeps of his eyes grew more cloudy. She loved that sullen handsomeness <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> so boyish, and, {{laughing}} and kissing him, she forced him into a chair, got off his coat, and unbuttoned shirt and undershirt and turned them in.|$|E
60|$|Mike {{happened}} to be near the notice-board when he pinned it up. It was only the pleasure of seeing his name down in black-and-white <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> trouble to <b>look</b> at the list. Bob's {{news of the day}} before yesterday had made it clear how that list would run.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in his intonation <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me <b>look</b> <b>him</b> in the face; he stood a little on tiptoe to look right and left about the ship, like a man filled with curiosity, and his whole expression and bearing testified to some suppressed excitement.|$|R
60|$|Watching the crowd, Jimmy {{had found}} his {{attention}} attracted chiefly by a party of three, a few tables away. The party consisted of a girl, rather pretty, a lady of middle age and stately demeanor, plainly her mother, and a light-haired, weedy {{young man in the}} twenties. It had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly high-pitched, gurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals that had drawn Jimmy's notice upon them. And it was the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh <b>that</b> now <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> again in their direction.|$|R
60|$|The eager {{brightening}} of his eyes, {{the flush}} of happiness <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> young on a sudden, were signs {{not to be}} mistaken. The sooner {{they were in the}} presence of a third person (Emily privately concluded) the better it might be for both of them. She led the way rapidly to the house.|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} a Norman knight spurred up to Henry with some {{communication}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> uneasy, and Christina, laying {{her hand on}} Edgar's arm, said: [...] "Brother, we have vaults.

60|$|Ellen {{seemed to}} have let her mother take her languor below along with the shawls she had given her. Buttoned into a close jacket, and skirted short for the sea, she pushed against the breeze at Breckon's elbow with a vigor <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> his {{surprise}} at her. Girl-like, she took it {{that something was wrong}} with her dress, and ran herself over with an uneasy eye.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Bale Out" [...] mashup {{incorporates}} audio {{clips of}} Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding [...] "I {{was looking at}} the lights." [...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something <b>that</b> maybe <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wayland was at {{once called}} upon {{to go out to}} America to superintend the defences of the Canadian frontier, and he {{resolved}} on taking his family out, obtaining land, and settling there permanently. He would pay all my Lady's debts, but she should never again appear in London society, and cruel exile as it must seem to her, he trusted that his affection and tenderness would in time reconcile her to the new way of life, knowing as she did that he had forgiven much <b>that</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a crushed and sorrowful man {{in the midst of all}} the successes and the honours he received from his country.|$|R
500|$|Following the game, Burrows accused Auger {{of having}} a {{personal}} vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month <b>that</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> bad. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson during a game on December 8, 2009, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a game misconduct. However, the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had embellished injury. Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: [...] "you made me look bad [...] so I'm {{going to get you}} back tonight." [...] He went on to tell reporters that Auger [...] "should stay out {{for the rest of the}} year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|He wore a swallow-tailed coat, with a {{waistcoat}} {{of white}} satin and fancy knee-breeches, and upon {{his feet were}} shoes with silver buckles. On his head was perched a tall silk hat <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> just as high as Twinkle's father, and in one paw he held a gold-headed cane. Also he wore big spectacles over his eyes, which made him look more dignified than any other woodchuck Twinkle had ever seen.|$|E
60|$|There was a cut {{upon his}} forehead, {{and they had}} been wetting his hair, which lay bedabbled and {{entangled}} on the pillow. One of his arms, resting outside the bed, was bandaged up, and he was very white. But it was not this, that after the first quick glance, and first assurance of his sleeping quietly, held Florence rooted to the ground. It was something very different from this, and more than this, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> so solemn in her eye.|$|E
60|$|This Mr. Boulder of whom Mr. Fyshe spoke might {{indeed have}} been seen at that moment at a further table of the lunch room eating a solitary meal, an oldish man with a great frame {{suggesting}} broken strength, with a white beard and with falling under-eyelids <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> {{as if he were}} just about to cry. His eyes were blue and far away, and his still, mournful face and his great bent shoulders seemed to suggest all the power and mystery of high finance.|$|E
50|$|After Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar) burns down Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) grocery shop empire, Shelley {{thinks that}} as they are friends, and that Charlie could rebuild Dev's shops. Over dinner at Dev and Sunita's flat, Shelley {{suggests}} to Dev that Charlie {{could do the job}} for mates' rates and he could start as soon as possible, as he doesn't have much work at the moment. Charlie is furious about this and tells Shelley <b>that</b> she has <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a fool so Shelley apologises again.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the sixth}} and last time that Peter Cushing portrayed {{the role of the}} obsessively driven Baron Frankenstein, a part he {{originated}} in 1957's The Curse of Frankenstein. Cushing had long been known throughout his career for his meticulous attention to detail, even in the planned handling and usage of props. For this film, he helped to design the wig that he wore, but years afterward regretted the outcome, and jokingly quipped <b>that</b> it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more like stage and screen actress Helen Hayes. But Cushing's dedication to his role was never truly dampened, and at age 59, looking somewhat gaunt and fragile, he still insisted upon performing a daring stunt which required him to leap from a tabletop onto the hulking creature's back, spinning wildly in circles to subdue the monster gone amok with a sedative.|$|R
50|$|When {{adapting}} the film for a western audience {{and making the}} leap from 2D to 3D, some changes to Astro had to be made. The more challenging was his kawaii portrayal, part of which were his large eyes and curly eyelashes, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> too feminine. Imagi had several discussions on how round and curvy Astro's body proportions should be {{and in the end}} they were made to be more lean. Also there were issues on Astro's rear end being too small, and that too was altered. The by-product of these changes was Astro's Caucasian look. In early development Astro's design was younger, resembling his iconic design of a 6-year-old boy. The design team changed <b>that</b> and <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like a 12-year-old to appeal to a larger audience. They also gave him a shirt, and a jacket since they thought it would be strange to have a normal boy running around without one. They also replaced his heart-shaped energy core with a glowing blue one.|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> like {{he wished}} he hadn't said anything. And he wanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in {{something}} and wants {{to take it out}} of somebody else. He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too. But Tom says: ...|$|E
60|$|The big car was {{an object}} of much curiosity to the natives, and during the {{afternoon}} Wampus {{was the center of}} attraction. Myrtle had stood the ride remarkably well, and Uncle John noticed that her eyes were brighter and a shade of color had already crept into her pale cheeks. Having risen early all three of the girls took a nap during the afternoon, as did Mr. Merrick. The Major gossiped with the station agent, the most important individual in town, and gleaned sundry information <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> rather glum.|$|E
6000|$|His {{landlord}} {{do it at}} his own expense? <b>That</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> knowing. He {{was evidently}} certain {{that it was a}} trick for raising the rent {{at the end of the}} lease, if not before, upon him, whose fathers had been tenants of Alfy Vale even before the Alisons came to Arghouse; and, with the rude obstinacy of his race, he was as uncivil to Harold as he durst in Eustace's presence. [...] "He had no mind to have his fields cut up just to sell the young gentleman's drain-pipes, as wouldn't go off at them potteries." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had laid}} on the table {{from the moment of}} her coming in the long envelope, {{substantially}} filled, which he had sent her enclosed in another of still ampler make. He had however not looked at it--his belief being that he wished never again to do so; besides which it had happened to rest with its addressed side up. So he [...] "saw" [...] nothing, and it was only into her eyes <b>that</b> her remark <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look,</b> declining any approach to the object indicated. [...] "It's not 'my' seal, my dear; and my intention--which my note tried to express--was all to treat it to you as not mine." ...|$|R
2500|$|Capaldi's costume has {{varied in}} some episodes. In [...] "Mummy on the Orient Express" [...] he dons a period-appropriate tuxedo. [...] In [...] "The Magician's Apprentice", he wears Ray-Ban {{sunglasses}} (later revealed in [...] "The Witch's Familiar" [...] to be a wearable {{version of his}} sonic screwdriver), a T-shirt and plaid baggy trousers along with the hoodie and Crombie coat. In [...] "Face the Raven", the Twelfth Doctor sports a red velvet variant of his Crombie coat. After briefly ditching it in [...] "Hell Bent", Clara comments <b>that</b> it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more 'doctory'. At {{the end of the}} episode, he dons the red coat in honour of her, and is given a new sonic screwdriver by the TARDIS. In the ending segment of [...] "The Husbands of River Song", the Doctor again dons the same tuxedo and period dress worn in [...] "Mummy on the Orient Express". In [...] "Thin Ice", the Doctor dons a dark blue velvet suit and a top hat while visiting London in 1814.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{in reply}} to their eager {{questions}} {{he told them}} that it was an old incident, that he had never spoken a word to the young man he had seen, and that he had only seen him once for a few minutes. The reason of his remembering him so well was that he had been struck by his appearance, so strangely incongruous in the circumstances, and <b>that</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> very sharply at him. Over two years had passed since, but it was still distinct in his memory. He had come to a small frontier settlement, a military outpost, on the extreme north-eastern border of the Republic, and had seen the garrison turn out for exercise from the fort. It was composed of the class of men one usually saw in these border forts, men of the lowest type, miztiros and mulattos most of them, criminals from the gaols condemned to serve in the frontier army for their crimes. And {{in the midst of the}} low-browed, swarthy-faced, ruffianly crew appeared the tall distinguished-looking young man with a white skin, blue eyes and light hair--an amazing contrast! ...|$|R
