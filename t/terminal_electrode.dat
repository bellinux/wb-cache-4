30|$|In summary, we have {{investigated}} cross-sectional potential distribution of thick PCDTBT:PCBM BHJ device using Kelvin probe force microscopy. At the anode interface, Schottky barrier was found because PCDTBT polymer has deeper HOMO level {{than that of}} PEDOT:PSS used as a hole transporting anode. On the other hand, cathode interface has an ohmic junction between PCBM and low work function metal Al. All potentials drop near cathode interface, which implies that BHJ is an effective p-type semiconductor. Another defective feature is measured that the potential shows wide log-normal distribution, where long tail of deep potential regions are locally and randomly distributed. Thick photoactive layer with large charge trap variation is prone to have potential dip, and hole capture might happen at the potentional dip during charge migration to <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode,</b> which in turn increases bimolecular recombination. If we decrease the thickness as thin as depletion width, then the superimposed potential gradient will mitigate potential dip and make captured carriers easily escape from the remaing potential dip.|$|E

Aim of the present investigation was to establish, by means of the analysis of a large patient population, the efficacy and reproducibility of high frequency surgery in the treatment of this condition. A total of 1689 non-allergic patients with nasal obstruction, presenting hypertrophy of the lower turbinates, were submitted, under local anaesthesia, to turbinates decongestion using a high frequency instrumental unit with a bipolar <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode.</b> Efficacy of the procedure was evaluated on the basis of objective examination, results of questionnaires, active anterior rhinomanometry and mucociliar transport time. Results revealed a reduction of hypertrophy, an improvement in symptoms, a reduction in nasal resistances and an improvement of mucociliar transport time. The large patient population, low post-operative complication rate and the good patient compliance, due also to the fact that no haemostatic procedure is necessary, would suggest that this method is particularly valid, effective and safe for the treatment of hypertrophy of the lower turbinates...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{applying}} the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique is presented for the optimization of high voltage electrode surfaces. The {{aim is to}} obtain the optimization of the electrode shape {{in order to achieve}} a uniform field distribution along the surface of the electrode and maintain maximum field stress at minimum value. The principle of the developed optimization technique is described with an axi-symmetric single-phase GIS bus <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode</b> considered as a quarter-ellipse. In this scheme different aspects of the optimization technique are compared by means of semi-infinite line charges and ring charges to compute the electric field with the charge simulation method (CSM). The new Biogeography Based optimized approach helps in achieving a uniform field distribution with a minimum electric stress on the electrode surface and a minimum deviation angle for the otherwise normal stress vector, holding the assignment factor within the assigned range. The deviation angle is the more sensitive indicator of the simulation accuracy. The assignment factor has an impact on simulation accuracy. The combined BBO/CSM algorithm is capable of finding a better-quality solution, better accuracy, better convergence characteristics and computational efficiency...|$|E

The highest-performing colloidal quantum dot solar cells have, to date, {{relied on a}} depleted-heterojunction architecture in which an n-type transparent metal oxide such as TiO 2 induces a depletion region in the p-type CQD solid. These devices have, until now, been limited by a modest depletion region depth produced in the CQD solid owing to limitations in the doping available in TiO 2. Herein we report a new device geometry - one based on a donor-supply electrode (DSE) - that leads to record-performing CQD photovoltaic devices. Only by employing this new charge-extracting approach do we deepen the depletion region in the CQD solid and thereby extract notably more photocarriers, the key element in achieving record photocurrent and device performance. With the use of optoelectronic modeling corroborated by experiment, we develop the guidelines for building a superior CQD solar cell based on the DSE concept.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to derive the normal limits of a new ECG lead system aimed at enhancing the amplitude of atrial potentials through the use of bipolar chest leads. Methods: Sixty healthy male subjects, mean age 38. 85 ± 8. 76 years (range 25 to 58 years) were included in this study. In addition to a standard 12 -lead ECG, a modified limb lead (MLL) ECG was recorded for 60 sec with the RA electrode placed in the 3 rd right intercostal space slightly {{to the left of the}} mid-clavicular line, the LA electrode placed in the 5 th right intercostal space slightly to the right of the mid-clavicular line and the LL electrode placed in the 5 th right intercostal space on the mid- clavicular line. Results: In the frontal plane, the modification of limb electrode positions produced significant changes compared to standard limb lead I and II. The mean P wave amplitude was 111 ± 17 μV in MLL I and 64 ± 16 μV in standard limb lead (SLL) I (p< 0. 001). Similarly it was 118 ± 22 μV in MLL II and 100 ± 27 μV in SLL II. No statistically significant changes were seen in V 1 -V 6 due to modification of the Wilson central <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode</b> positions. Conclusion: The modification of limb electrode placement leads to changes in the amplitude of the P waves in the MLL leads I and II compared to SLL leads I and II in healthy subjects.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{clinical}} electrocardiography have indicated {{the desirability of}} taking multiple pre-cordial leads as a general routine practice. In their secondary supplementary report (1943) the Com-mittee of the American Heart Association for the Standardization of Preecordial Leads stated that they believed that three is the least number of prx-cordial leads that {{can be regarded as}} satisfactory for general purposes. They suggested that those who wished to reduce the numnber of such leads to a minimum take leads from the C 1, C 3, and C 5 positions. All were urged to take additional leads whenever possible. Though a right pracordial lead, C 1, is recommended for general use, sufficient data have not yet been obtained on this lead either in regard to the range of normal or concerning its various abnormalities. Furthermore there is no agreement as to what is the best distal electrode for general use, a matter of considerable, practical importance. The Wilson central <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode,</b> the right arm, the left leg, and the right scapula has each been preferred by different investigators. In an attempt to gain further information on the right precordial lead C 1 and to assess its value for general use we (1) have reviewed previous reports in which such a lead was employed; (2) have taken a series of electrocardiograms including this lead on patients without heart disease to determine the range of normal variations; and (3) have also noted characteristic alterations in CF 1 in certain cardiac conditions particularly posterior wall infarction, in which the use of this lead may be helpful.

40|$|Goldberger {{has claimed}} that his {{augmented}} unipolar limb leads (aV) are identical {{except for a}} 50 per cent larger amplitude and interchangeable with Wilson's original V leads, but this claim was not supported by quantitative evidence. The advantage of larger amplitudes explains the increasing preference for the aV leads. A quantitative comparison between V and aV leads re-vealed such tremendous variability of the augmentation ratio, both interindividual and between leads in the same individual, that standards obtained with V leads are not applicable to aV leads and vice versa. V leads and aV leads are not interchangeable. P ROCEEDING from the Einthoven tri-angle theory of the electrocardiogram, Wilson and his collaborators ' suggested that a relatively neutral reference electrode (T) could be obtained by pooling the three limb electrodes in a common terminal. Though the potential of such a <b>terminal</b> <b>electrode</b> is not zero, it is definitely smaller than the potential variations in any single limb electrode. In spite of the theoretic merit of Wilson's V lead, it has the disadvantage of occasional small magnitude of the deflections in the unipolar limb leads VR, VL, and VF. In order to increase the amplitude of deflections, while still retain-ing the advantage of an "indifferent " reference electrode, Goldberger 2 - 4 modified Wilson's pro-cedure by disconnecting the central terminal from the limb to which the exploring electrode was attached. Thus, Goldberger pools only two instead of three leads. By mathematical de-duction he concluded that this procedure would augment the deflections by 50 per cent. This was expressed in the nomenclature "aV " leads, "a " indicating augmented. Expressed on a percentage basis, the unipolar aV limb leads would equal 150 per cent of the amplitudes in the unipolar V leads. Except for the larger amplitude, Goldberger claimed that the V and aV leads are identical and interchangeable.

After four weeks, five bipolar jejunal and <b>terminal</b> ileal <b>electrodes</b> were implanted. Seven days later, myoelectric activity was measured in conscious, fasted animals before and after treatment with erythromycin. Biliary lipid composition was assessed.  Results—Compared with controls, animals fed the high cholesterol diet exhibited a prolonged MMC cycle period (70 (6) versus 83 (3) minutes; p< 0. 05), whereas MMC migration velocity and the proportions of the MMC represented by phases I, II, and III were unchanged. Oral erythromycin significantly shortened the MMC cycle period in animals on the control and high cholesterol diet by 59 % and 54 % respectively, and increased the proportion of the cycle period occupied by phase III of the MMC in both dietary groups. Gall bladder bile became saturated with cholesterol and crystals developed in nine of 12 animals on the high cholesterol diet; controls had none.  Conclusion—Animals fed a high cholesterol diet had a prolonged MMC cycle period. This, along with diminished gall bladder motility, impairs the enterohepatic cycling of bile salts and reduces their hepatic secretion, contributing to the formation of abnormal bile. Erythromycin initiated more frequent cycling of the MMC. Its therapeutic value in cholesterol gallstone formation warrants further evaluation. ...|$|R
