5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in <b>the</b> <b>California</b> clade, and that common ravens in <b>the</b> <b>California</b> clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade.
