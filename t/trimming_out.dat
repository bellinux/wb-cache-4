30|$|In {{order to}} decide which part of a VN request to embed, if at all, the InP can use {{existing}} intra-domain VN embedding algorithms [6, 8] that can identify conflicting resource requirements in a VN request. This can be done iteratively by looking into {{the output of the}} linear programs used in both [6, 8] without modifying the actual algorithms presented in those work, and <b>trimming</b> <b>out</b> parts of the virtual network until a feasible solution is found. However, we argue that this heuristic may not be sufficient for high quality or even feasible partial embeddings. In particular, we must ensure that if an InP maps a virtual link, it also maps the two nodes incident to it. We also wish to minimize the number of virtual links that map across multiple domains as inter-domain paths tend to be long and thus are more costly.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new measure of underlying inflation: component-smoothed inflation. It approaches {{the problem of}} determining underlying inflation from a different direction than previous methods. Rather than excluding or <b>trimming</b> <b>out</b> volatile CPI items, it smoothes components of the CPI based on their volatility – CPI expenditure weights are maintained for all items. Items such as rent are smoothed a little, if at all, while volatile series such as fruit, vegetables and automotive fuel are smoothed a lot. This removes much of the temporary volatility in the CPI while retaining most of the persistent signal. Because our underlying inflation measure includes all CPI items at all times, it is robust to sustained relative price changes and is unbiased in the long run. A potential cost {{of this approach is}} that, unlike other measures, it places weight on lagged as well as contemporaneous prices for volatile series. An evaluation of the balance between {{the costs and benefits of}} this approach remains an open question. CPI; core inflation; underlying inflation; Australia; United States...|$|E
40|$|The XF- 12 {{airplane}} is {{a high-performance}} photo-reconnaissance aircraft {{designed for the}} Army Air Forces by the Republic Aviation Corporation. An investigation of a 1 / 8. 33 - scale powered model {{was made in the}} Langley l 9 -foot pressure tunnel to obtain information relative to the aerodynamic design of the airplane. The model was tested with and without the original vertical tail. and with two revised tails. For the revised tail no. 1, the span of the original vertical. tail was increased about 15 percent and the portion of the vertical tail between the stabilizer and fuselage behind the rudder hinge line was allowed to deflect simultaneously with the main rudder. Revision no. 2 incorporated the increased span, but the lower rudder was locked in the neutral position. For all the tail arrangements investigated it was indicated that the airplane will possess positive effective dihedral and will be directionally stable regardless of flap or power condition. The rudder effectiveness is greater for the revised tails than for the original tail, but this is offset by the increase in directional stability caused by the revised tail. All the rudder arrangements appear inadequate in <b>trimming</b> <b>out</b> the resultant yawing moments at zero yaw in a take - off condition with the left-hand outboard propeller windmilling and the remaining engines developing take-off power...|$|E

50|$|Trim is {{the angle}} of the motor in {{relation}} to the hull, as illustrated below. The ideal trim angle is the one in which the boat rides level, with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water.If the motor is <b>trimmed</b> <b>out</b> too far, the bow will ride too high in the water. With too little trim, the bow rides too low. The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed, hull design, weight and balance, and conditions on the water (wind and waves). Many large outboards are equipped with power trim, an electric motor on the mounting bracket, with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the trim angle on the fly. In this case, the motor should be trimmed fully in to start, and <b>trimmed</b> <b>out</b> (with an eye on the tachometer) as the boat gains momentum, until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an RPM increase with no increase in speed. Motors not equipped with power trim are manually adjustable using a pin called a topper tilt lock.|$|R

5000|$|Ventilation is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when surface air or exhaust gas (in the case of motors equipped with through-hub exhaust) is drawn into the spinning propeller blades. With the propeller pushing mostly air instead of water, the load on the engine is greatly reduced, causing the engine to race and the propeller to spin fast enough to result in cavitation, at which point little thrust is generated at all. The condition continues until the prop slows enough for the air bubbles {{to rise to the}} surface. [...] The primary causes of ventilation are: motor mounted too high, motor <b>trimmed</b> <b>out</b> excessively, damage to the antiventilation plate, damage to propeller, foreign object lodged in the diffuser ring.|$|R

50|$|Features 150 nm {{or below}} in size {{generally}} require phase-shifting {{to enhance the}} image quality to acceptable values. This can be achieved in many ways. The two most common methods are to use an attenuated phase-shifting background film on the mask to increase the contrast of small intensity peaks, or to etch the exposed quartz so that the edge between the etched and unetched areas {{can be used to}} image nearly zero intensity. In the second case, unwanted edges would need to be <b>trimmed</b> <b>out</b> with another exposure. The former method is attenuated phase-shifting, and is often considered a weak enhancement, requiring special illumination for the most enhancement, while the latter method is known as alternating-aperture phase-shifting, and is the most popular strong enhancement technique.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1985, it was {{announced}} that plans for a new canard were being offered, to eliminate [...] "rain trim change" [...] that had been experienced by Long-EZ pilots. This trim change is usually a nose down trim change experienced when flying into rain requiring a small aft force on the stick to maintain altitude, which is easily <b>trimmed</b> <b>out,</b> using the bungee trim system. The new canard was designed with the Roncz R1145MS airfoil, which produces considerably more lift than the original GU25-5(11)8 airfoil. This enabled the new canard to be designed with less span, reducing wetted area and thus drag. The new canard has a negligible rain trim and the rain only adds 2 knots to the stall speed.|$|R

After separately mapping the woody cover on the respective aerial photographs from a given analysis year and study site, using image classification, the photographs were joined into thematic layer mosaics. All the images were carefully examined for presence of burn scars whose dark tone could have introduced error in mapping woody cover. Consequently the 1940 photographs of the Nhlowa site were excluded from the analysis due to extensive burn scars.|$|R
40|$|Errors {{that arise}} from {{tolerance}} variations and mismatches between devices severely degrade the performance of bandgap reference circuits, which are essential building blocks to all highperformance systems.

Resistor TC errors cannot be <b>trimmed</b> <b>out</b> and hence resistors must therefore be carefully selected and designed...|$|R
