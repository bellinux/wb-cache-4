These national monographs are supplemented where relevant with international monographs which detail the workings of supranational organisations that affect the field of law in question, or offer an overview of the field from a comparative perspective. The International Encyclopaedia for <b>Transport</b> <b>Law</b> contains national monographs in this subset of the International Encyclopaedia of Laws.

Robert Pelkey sued Dan's City Used Cars under New Hampshire law for unlawfully selling his vehicle.

40|$|A geomorphic {{transport}} {{law is a}} mathematical statement derived from a physi-cal principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused {{by one or more}} processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field meas-urements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geo-morphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, con-cerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic <b>transport</b> <b>laws</b> are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic <b>transport</b> <b>laws</b> for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear trans-port due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic <b>transport</b> <b>laws,</b> however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic <b>transport</b> <b>laws</b> in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic <b>transport</b> <b>laws</b> may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form. 1...|$|E

40|$|Common core, PECL and DCFR, {{could they}} change {{shipping}} and <b>transport</b> <b>law?</b> This question {{was included in}} the call for papers for this book. The great response to the call suggests that even though harmonization of shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> has a much greater tradition than harmonization of general private law, still uniformity in shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> could benefit from the harmonization instruments. This should come as no surprise: despite the long standing tradition, unification of shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> didn’t go as far as would be desirable from a trade perspective and three major shortcomings are harmful to uniformity. First of all, some important areas of <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> are still excluded from uniform law. The lack of such uniform rules in these fields is often also detrimental for uniformity in unified fields of law. For example, the lack of uniform rules on transport intermediaries impacts the qualification by national courts of a service provider as a carrier or rather as a transport intermediary and creates therefore also a crack in uniform carriage law. Secondly, even in fields that are unified, there is often only a partial unification, addressing only specific questions. Consequently other questions are left outside the unification. Again, fields that are left outside unification can strongly impact the uniformity of decisions in cases subject to uniform law. For example, the lack of uniform rules on contract interpretation and validity of the contract will obviously impact the interpretation of contracts subject to uniform law in different member states, and will can also lead to diverging court decisions in these member states. The possible impact of the harmonization instruments on contract interpretation are discussed by professor Legros in chapter 1. Other questions that Finally, even for subjects falling within the scope of uniform law, uniform rules are often nonetheless interpreted in a different way by national courts, as these courts read their national law concepts into the uniform rules. This prevents these uniform legislations from resulting in uniform law. As great parts of uniform <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> apply mandatorily, the impact of these cracks in uniformity is even greater. Commercial law is in general Darwinist, in this sense that parties provide for their own contractual framework if uniform law is not considered adequate to govern the specific contract, resulting eventually in the disuse of inadequate regimes. The mandatory nature of said regimes prevents this however, causing inefficient legislation to create obstacles to trade. Taking into account these shortcomings, further unification of private law aspects of shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> seems highly desirable. Nevertheless, some legislative fatigue has crept into unification of private law aspects of shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law.</b> Here, a two-fold role can come to the harmonisation instruments. First of all from a methodological point of view, the grassroots perspective taken by harmonisation instruments could offer an example for shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law.</b> Second, the provisions of the harmonisation instruments could be beneficial for shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> from different points of view. First of all, some of these provisions could be very useful when developing future European shipping and <b>transport</b> <b>law</b> instruments. Secondly these harmonisation instruments could offer a useful tool for gap-filling. For example parties could contractually incorporate these instrument as to create a neutral gap-filling mechanism. Finally de lege ferenda, if these harmonisation instruments would result in an (optional) European instrument, there can be a direct impact of such instrument for topics that are still subject to national law. From this introduction it follows that there could come a role to the harmonization instruments. All authors examine for their field of expertise if the instruments could have any impact, and if so, what this impact would be. All three the aforementioned problems are addressed in some contributions: the impact on fields left outside the harmonisation, on topics not addressed in uniform law and finally on different interpretations of uniform rules.
