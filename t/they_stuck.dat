5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove jokes and dialogue. Curtis recalls that <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny, then it was never put back.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped {{computer}} disks to make edits. <b>They</b> <b>stuck</b> to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} also {{focused on the}} divorce's effects on Milhouse {{and there was a}} subplot that {{involved}} Bart being jealous of Milhouse and wishing that Marge and Homer would also separate. Several scenes were written and animated for the episode, but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long. The third act of the episode shifts the focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience's interest for an entire episode. Bill Oakley has said that he felt the episode would have failed had <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> with the Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1970s, Genoa would mostly play {{in second}} league. Under the {{management}} of Arturo Silvestri the club made its way back to Serie A for the 1973–74 season, but they were relegated straight back down. For the return of Il Grifone to Series A a couple of seasons later, the squad featured the likes of Roberto Rosato, Bruno Conti and a young Roberto Pruzzo. This time <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> {{it out in the}} top division for two seasons before succumbing to relegation in 1977–78; the relegation was particularly cruel as the side above them Fiorentina survived on goal-difference of just a single goal, the two teams had played each other {{on the final day of}} the season ending in a 0–0 draw.|$|E
25|$|England's innings {{was more}} solid than Australia's - {{the first seven}} batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 - but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) {{struggled}} along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it wasn't a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times {{as he and his}} vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence - and the lengthening shadows - got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.|$|E

500|$|Busch {{felt his}} {{painting}} skills could {{not compete with}} those of the Dutch masters. He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them {{one on top of the}} other in damp corners of his studio, where <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> together. If the pile of paintings became too high, he burnt some in his garden. Since only a few remaining pictures are dated, categorizing them is difficult. His doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials. His ground was usually chosen carelessly. Sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly-prepared spruce-wood boards. One exception is a portrait of Johanna Kessler, on a canvas support measuring [...] by , one of his largest paintings. Most of his works, even landscapes, are small. As Busch used poor grounds and colours, most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect.|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
500|$|McKinley, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his 1893 financial crisis, had avoided scandal and carefully guarded his image, making him difficult to attack. [...] Hanna proved an easier target. Although Davenport had depicted Hanna in his cartoons before the Republican convention in June, these efforts were uninspired. This changed once Davenport got a look at his subject while attending the 1896 Republican National Convention in St. Louis. After three days spent closely observing Hanna managing the convention to secure McKinley's nomination and passage of a platform supporting the gold standard, Davenport was impressed with Hanna's dynamic behavior. [...] Convinced that he could effectively lampoon Hanna, Davenport's cartoons became more effective. Hanna was a tall man; Davenport exaggerated this trait, in part by shrinking everybody else. He also increased Hanna's already substantial girth. [...] Hanna's short sideburns were lengthened and made rougher—Davenport described them as [...] "like an unplaned cedar board". [...] Davenport borrowed from the animal kingdom for his creation, drawing Hanna's ears so <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> out like a monkey's. [...] The cartoonist described Hanna's eyes as like a parrot's, leaving no movement unseen, or as those of a circus elephant—scanning the street for peanuts.|$|E

500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E
500|$|Marrara Oval {{became the}} 89th Test venueand the eighth in Australia. On {{a slow and}} low drop-in pitch airlifted from Melbourne {{a month before the}} match, Australia won the toss and elected to field. Bangladesh {{collapsed}} and were bowled out for 97 within three hours, with only Mohammad Ashraful (23) and Khaled Mahmud (21) providing resistance. [...] All four Australian bowlers chimed in, as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, [...] "A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve." [...] Australia initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, [...] "It was hard work out there. <b>They</b> <b>stuck</b> to their guns pretty well, they put it in the right areas and made it tough to score runs." [...] When asked about becoming only the second batsman to score a hundred against all nine Test-playing nations, Waugh said: ...|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's {{starting}} quarterback from 1948 to 1960, {{and had a}} franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. [...] "There was a time my rookie year when I really saw it", recalled running back Frank Gifford. [...] "He broke his nose really badly, they literally called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, <b>they</b> <b>stuck</b> stuff up there until it would stop bleeding. You {{try to get them}} to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'". In 1951, the Giants finished 9–2–1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost them an opportunity to play in the Championship Game. Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al Derogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7–5, but Tunnell continued to impress. [...] "Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained" [...] according to one publication. Tunnell amassed 924yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953, and they fell to a 3–9 record. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62–14 to division rival Cleveland.|$|E
