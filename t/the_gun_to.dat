After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from an army Flak unit with a half-track mounting a large anti-aircraft gun arrived.

5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E

500|$|Both turrets used {{steam engines}} to rotate, but the Eads design also {{used it to}} power {{virtually}} every function in the turret, including running out <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> absorbing <b>the</b> recoil from firing, and opening <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> ports <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> fire. <b>The</b> ability to adjust {{the level of the}} turret floor doubled the elevation of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> +20° compared to the +10° allowed in an Ericsson turret. Another advantage was that the Eads turret only required a crew of six men, far fewer than the Ericsson design. Each gun weighed approximately [...] They could fire a [...] shell up to a range of [...] at an elevation of +15°.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> could elevate <b>to</b> 20° and {{to depress}} to −5°, but the turret sights could only elevate 15°, {{effectively}} limiting the range {{that could be}} achieved unless firing under director control.

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

However, Scully shoots him {{to prevent him from}} doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and, when he awakens, reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply and that she shot him because if he had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove his innocence in his father's death. She then introduces him to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the digital tape.|$|E
5|$|The {{girls are}} soon {{captured}} by Fireflies, who restrain them; Marlene, {{the leader of}} the Fireflies, recognizes Ellie, and demands that she remain safe. When Riley claims she would like to join their group, Marlene refuses, and the two argue, resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley. Ellie intervenes, demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie. When Ellie finally lowers the gun, Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie's mother, and had promised her that she would take care of Ellie. Ellie hands <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> Marlene, who says that she would tell her more about her mother in the future, before telling the girls to leave. When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone, Riley says that there is no escape. Ellie suggests running away, but Riley informs her that this will just result in death. The two then walk back into the school.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> {{were placed}} in a Mk 22 mount. The {{mounting}} allowed <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> elevate from −15° to 85°. The elevation and train rates were manually operated, though the mounts could train 360°.|$|R
50|$|A {{solution}} to this problem was <b>to</b> fit <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> sidecar motorcycles. This would allow <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> be moved rapidly between different sectors, and allow them to quickly pursue retreating enemy troops. Clyno motorcycles were initially adopted; these could carry <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> tripod, water and spare parts, as well as seven ammunition boxes; they were supported by unarmed sidecar motorcycles that carried only ammunition. A number of different motorcycles were eventually used. A special unit, <b>the</b> Motor Machine <b>Gun</b> Service, was formed to operate them, but the static nature of trench warfare meant the unit was infrequently used.|$|R

25|$|In February 1782, Princess Royal Battery was {{the site}} of the first use of Lieutenant George Koehler's {{depressing}} gun-carriage. This allowed the angle of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> be aimed down at an angle of seventy degrees. This enabled the defending soldiers {{to take advantage of the}} height of the Rock of Gibraltar. It was ingenius because the sliding carriage allowed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> recoil without sending the gun carriage into the air. This idea was later built into more conventional gun carriages. Colonel John Drinkwater in his accounts claimed that the gun hit its target 28 times out of 30 when aimed at the Spaniard's San Carlos Battery.|$|E

25|$|The {{cast iron}} shell, similar in shape to a Minié ball, had a thin lead coating {{which made it}} fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell.

25|$|Lake {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> Wyatt Earp, but modern {{researchers have}} not found any supporting evidence from secondary sources or in available primary documentation of the gun's existence prior to the publication of Lake's book. After its publication, various Colt revolvers with long (10-inch or 16-inch) barrels were called Colt Buntlines or Buntline Specials. Colt manufactured the pistol among its second-generation revolvers produced after 1956. A number of other manufacturers, such as Uberti, Navy Arms, and Cimarron Arms, have made their own versions of this long-barreled revolver.|$|E

There is a limited number of shots of each power level available — once these run out, the firepower of the gun falls down by one level. At higher firepower levels the gun's rate of fire drops down, forcing the player to wait for <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> cool down before firing again; the temperature of the gun is indicated by another meter on the left-hand side.

25|$|To ensure Kurt and {{the enemies}} moved as realistically as possible, their {{movements}} were created using motion capture, {{a relatively new}} technology in video game development at the time. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, {{the most important aspect}} was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble.|$|E
