5|$|As well as <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory {{studied the}} {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, {{and worked with}} DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E

5|$|By mid-summer of 1942, Mt. St. Peter Parish {{was once}} again without funds.

5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a motet in stile antico, similar to late Renaissance music, as the third movement.

5|$|Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard is {{a poem by}} Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.|$|E

5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E
5|$|In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the {{painting}} {{on his own}} initiative. During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had made with a male model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis {{that had taken place}} during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E

The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
