40|$|Woman is an ever-present {{image in}} the prose poems Nadja, L'amour fou and Arcane 17 by Andre Breton. While the image {{incorporates}} several autobiographical references, {{this is not the}} revelation. With textual recurrence forming a thematic, <b>topical</b> <b>thread,</b> the image is seen in its poetic, symbolic and mythical dimensions. Woman offers a surrealist poet a rhetorical gift. In these works the image of woman acquires symbolic value. It is identified with Nature in its cosmic, telluric reality, rooted in the unconscious in its oneiric reality. It is epiphanic in that it gives access to the Other's vision. To the poet it represents, to use Carl Jung's hermeneutic, the archetypal figure of the Anima. In its mythical dimensions, finally, the image calls forth the great visions of femininity: Muse, Sprite, Fairy, Elf, Virgin [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since Conceptualism, {{the field}} of art has become {{increasingly}} accustomed to playing host to its own critique, and recent decades have seen institutions engaged in self-critique as if by mandate. Important notions of legibility, autonomy, and critical engagement that were once necessary {{to carve out a}} space for a critic or critical art publication have transposed themselves onto artistic production proper, and are now considered to be of equal importance to artist, curator, institution, and engaged audience member alike. This has made the distance that was once the bedrock of criticism increasingly hard to come by, {{compounded by the fact that}} those same institutions have been faced with an entirely widened base of audiences and professionals, who now come to the sphere of art from diverse fields and locations, invariably entering and leaving it as they wish. This climate of disciplinary reconfiguration and geographic dispersal has made the art world a highly complex place—the objective position that once defined the role of a critic has been effectively replaced by a need to understand just how large and varied the whole thing has become. The urgent task has now become to engage the new intellectual territories in a way that can revitalize the critical vocabulary of contemporary art. Perhaps the most productive way of doing this is through a fresh approach to the function of an art journal as something that situates the multitude of what is currently available, and makes that available back to the multitude. The selection of essays included in this book seeks to highlight an ongoing <b>topical</b> <b>thread</b> that ran throughout the first eight issues of e-flux journal—a sequence of overlapping concerns passed on from one contribution to the next. While it is our hope that the essays included here can begin to give a sense of how varied the concerns and urgencies being engaged today are, we also expect that certain consistencies and overarching issues will emerge through them, and help us shape the forthcoming editions of the journal.

Grochola Szczepanek 2006). Metoda fokusnih skupin (poleg osebnega intervjuja) je med najbolj priljubljenimi kvalitativnimi metodami, ki se uporabljajo na podro~ju tr`enja, v sociologiji in psihologiji. To metodo lahko uporabimo tudi v jezikoslovju, zlasti v sociolingvisti~nih in etnolingvi-sti~nih raziskavah, {e posebej takrat, ko tradicionalni jezikoslovni opis s pomo~jo ankete ali vpra{alnika ne zadostuje. V ~asu globalnih kulturnih sprememb je mo`no raziskovati spremembe v jeziku samo v povezavi s socialnimi in kulturnimi dejavniki. intervju fokusne skupine, ruralni govor, spol The paper {{presents}} {{the most important}} principles of the focus group method and shows how it is used {{in a study of}} rural language with a special emphasis on gender in language (cf. Grochola Szczepanek 2006). The focus method (alongside the personal interview) {{is one of the most}} popular qualitative methods used in marketing, sociology and psychology. This method can also be used in linguistics, particularly in socio-linguistic and ethno-linguistic studies. It can be applied when traditional linguistic description with the help of a survey or questionnaire methods is not sufficient. At a time of global cultural change, an examination of changes in language is possible only with reference to social and cultural factors. focus group interview, rural speech, gender 1 History of Focus Research The term »focus method « comes from the English expression »focus group interview (FGI) « or »focus group discussion (FGD) «, or »focus group « for short. A Polish equivalent of these terms is »zogniskowany wywiad grupowy « (focused group interview). This is a kind of group discussion, controlled by a moderator, which follows a pre-prepared scenario. The word »focus « refers to concentrating on just one topic or one <b>topical</b> <b>thread</b> during the interview. The focus method was developed in the 1930 s by two American sociologists: Robert Merton and Paul Lazarsfeld, who were among the first to describe the method and call it »the focused interview « (Merton 1946). Focused interviews conducted jointly by Merton and Lazarsfeld were used to evaluate radio programmes and, after the war, to tes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This thesis {{adopts a}} multivariate {{approach}} to examine perceptions and practices regarding routine dentist-patient interactions in initial consultations. METHODS: A 16 -item Dental Patient Feedback on Consultation skills (DPFC) questionnaire was adapted {{for use in}} the dental setting through face, content, and construct validity. A cross-sectional survey (n= 389) of patients’ perceptions of their dentist’s clinical performances was conducted in a teaching hospital. Test-retest reliability (n= 42) was assessed. Variations in DPFC responses (scale and item level) were examined in relation to socio-demographics and dental attendance patterns in bivariate and regression analyses. Second tier data was collected in the form of 70 audio-visual recordings (~ 15 hours) which were transcribed and sequentially analyzed to identify internal structures. Corpus-based discourse and sociolinguistic analysis drawing on traditions of Conversation Analysis, was used to identify dental consultation stages and sequential patterns across turn-taking systems. Transcribed recordings from the top quartile of survey results (n= 18) were examined to reveal how dentists and their patients co-accomplished ‘successful’ consultations. RESULTS: Face validity of the DPFC questionnaire ranged 81. 1 - 100 %. Content Validity Index ranged 0. 73 - 1. 00. Variations across DPFC scores regarding global ratings of satisfaction were apparent (p< 0. 001). Cronbach’s alpha value was 0. 94 and Intraclass Coefficient Correlation value was 0. 89. Results identified that dental attendance pattern was a factor associated with DPFC (p< 0. 05); but no significant differences were observed regarding socio-demographics. Corpus-based discourse and sociolinguistic analysis indicated seven specific consultation stages across the 70 recordings. This was divided into two parts by radiographic imaging, namely Part A: Opening, Oral Problem Presentation, Medical History Taking, Oral Examination, Post-examination; and Part B: Diagnosis and Explanation, and Closing. Sequential analysis of Turn-Constructional Units in the Oral Problem Presentation Stage across the 70 recordings indicated patterns for dentists’ soliciting and patients’ presenting. Dentists solicited patient problems through open-ended questions (n= 68) and closed-ended questions (n= 2). Patients adopted two oral problem presentation types either using talk with gestures (n= 61) or without gestures (n= 9). Sequential analysis of the top quartile of recordings (n= 18) revealed that patients perceived higher satisfaction with clinical communication if dentists re-visited their oral problems in the Diagnosis and Explanation Stage through a stepwise formulation. This presented as re-visiting patients’ oral problems through either repeating patients’ own terms or repairing patients’ prior talk. Finally, a case is analyzed to examine how a patient perceived effective dentist communication despite receiving a less-than-satisfactory admission outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of socio-demographic variations in DPFC indicates similar treatment across groups and standardized communication practices by dentists in this public hospital context. Patients with prior dental visits within one year require greater attention in first encounters, possibly due to their recently unresolved oral problems. To enhance the quality of dentist-patient communication, dentists need to attend to patients’ non-verbal signals during talk when presenting oral problems. In identifying how patients and dentists co-accomplish ‘successful’ communication, a clear <b>topical</b> <b>thread</b> connecting patients’ oral problem presentation with the final dentist explanation stages emerged. Empirical findings suggest re-visiting of patients’ oral problems before delivering diagnosis may enhance patient perceptions of ‘successful’ communication in initial consultations. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a model harvesting the crowd-sourced encyclopedic knowledge provided by Wikipedia to im-prove the conversational abilities of an artificial agent. More precisely, {{we present a}} model for automatic topic identification in ongoing natural language dialogs. On {{the basis of a}} graph-based representation of the Wikipedia category system, our model implements six tasks essential for detecting the topical overlap of coherent dialog contributions. Thereby the identification process operates online to handle dialog streams of constantly changing <b>topical</b> <b>threads</b> in real-time. The realization of the model and its application to our conversational agent aims to improve human-agent conversations by transferring human-like topic awareness to the artificial interlocutor.
