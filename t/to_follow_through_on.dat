5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a five-place grid penalty left him sixth overall. Two hours before the race, protests against parts introduced onto {{the floor of the}} Red Bull RB8 left team principal Christian Horner with a choice: to change the offending parts and start both cars from the pit lane, guaranteeing that any result the team recorded would be preserved; or to leave the parts on the car, allowing both drivers to start the race from the positions they qualified in, but risking a post-race exclusion. Horner ultimately chose the latter option, and Mark Webber started from pole, establishing an early lead over Nico Rosberg as a first-corner accident eliminated four cars. The race was run under the constant threat of rain, with drivers trying to extend the life of their tyres to avoid being forced to make an additional stop and falling down the order. The rain never materialised, though Jean-Éric Vergne was observed using a set of intermediate tyres late in the race. The variety of strategies used by the front-runners resulted in the last ten laps being contested with the top six cars running nose-to-tail. Webber visibly faded in the final laps, but held on when the following cars were momentarily pinned behind the slow-moving Heikki Kovalainen. Webber won the race – his second on the streets of Monaco – with Rosberg second and Fernando Alonso third, the result giving Alonso a three-point lead in the championship. Red Bull Racing maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship as rival teams chose not <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> <b>on</b> the threat of their pre-race protest, while Kovalainen finished thirteenth to see Caterham overtake Marussia for tenth place. Elsewhere, Spanish Grand Prix winner Pastor Maldonado was given a ten-place grid penalty for an incident that saw him clip Sergio Pérez. Combined with a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox, Maldonado started from the back row of the grid where he was eliminated in the first-corner accident.|$|E

50|$|Hunters using {{centerfire}} rifles find suppressors bring various important {{benefits that}} outweigh {{the extra weight}} and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter {{as well as their}} companions.

By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> calmly <b>on</b> their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary. Wildlife of all kinds are often confused as to the direction of the source of a well-suppressed shot.

25|$|Despite this, {{controversy}} did not flare {{until the}} assertions reached {{the general public}} as a commercial best-seller in Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers, particularly in sincere accusations by icons such as Richard Winters.

40|$|Land {{reform in}} Moldova, {{as in all}} former Soviet republics, {{involves}} the transfer of land from state <b>to</b> private ownership, <b>followed</b> by allocation of individual entitlements to land. Ideally, it also involves restructuring of the traditional large-scale enterprises into market-oriented farming units. The new farming units may represent {{a wide range of}} organizational forms, including various associative structures as well as individual farms. The principles of land reform were developed and formulated while Moldova was still a Soviet republic, but the implementation of these principles was made feasible only with the adoption of the new Land Code and the Law on Peasant Farms (December 1991 −January 1992). The Land Code set out the mechanisms for the privatization of land, while the Law on Peasant Farms provided the legal tools for the establishment of individual private farms through the process of exits from collective farm enterprises. Despite an early start, the process of land reform in Moldova advanced very slowly until 1996. The government and parliament lacked political resolve <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> forcefully <b>on</b> this issue. As a result, administrative support for land privatization and farm restructuring was relatively weak at the beginning of reform in 1992, and the managers of former collective and state farms were reluctant participants in the process of change.

500|$|Of {{the five}} volumes, the second {{may be the}} most {{interesting}}: it dealt with more interesting times, and more consistent military operations. The army of the north was a [...] "bad army," [...] and the story of its command is one of [...] "honest and brave men hurried in turn to the guillotine, or of less honest men going over to the enemy." [...] Some of Phipps' own eccentricities also appear in volume two; he frequently lapses into sarcasm, revealing his disdain for civilian administration of military affairs, and there are points at which he fails <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> fully <b>on</b> his criticism; for example, he holds back on his critique of Jean Victor Moreau despite his assertion that he wanted to demolish once and for all the myth that Moreau was as great a soldier as Napoleon. Phipps adeptly describes the game of cat and mouse that Moreau, Jean Baptiste Jourdan, and the Archduke Charles played with one another in the summer of 1796 as their armies criss-crossed south-western Germany; neither general came to grips with the other until October, and even then, after the Battle of Schliengen, Charles was content to chase Moreau and Jourdan over the Rhine, not to demolish the French army.

The results show that while the default nudge was effective at the time of application, it was not enough to change attitudes towards the nudged behavior as would be needed for long-term success. Indeed, we rather find that those who adopted an action that went against the nudge were more motivated <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>on</b> <b>through</b> with this action later on than those who went with the nudge. We furthermore show that giving people more leeway in how to respond to a nudge improves acceptance of the nudge.

The trip was approximately 1,500 miles; when the USS Indianapolis sunk it was 300 miles from land. The second role Naquin played was <b>to</b> not <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> <b>on</b> being notified of a distress call from a ship in the approximate area where the USS Indianapolis would be, even once he was made aware that the USS Indianapolis was seriously overdue. His justification was that it was Navy policy to confirm a distress call and his Office sent out a reply message but did not get a return message. The reason for this policy was that the Navy wanted {{to be sure that the}} call was not an enemy trap. There were many high-ranking officers who had knowledge of the route and schedule of the USS Indianapolis voyage from Tinian to Guam to Leyte and were anticipating word of the ships arrival in Leyte. There are many scenarios where, under proper Navy procedure the survivors could have been found at least approximately 24 hours before they were, and as soon as twenty-four hours after {{the sinking of the}} ship, which would have been forty-eight hours earlier. They were not found until a pilot on routine patrol spotted them by accident approximately seventy-one hours after the incident. It took another two days for everybody to be rescued. The crew consisted of 1,196 young men in their late teens and early twenties. Approximately 300 went down with the ship and 317 survived, with approximately 550-600 lost at sea.

So said Daniel Burnham in 1909 when he exhorted Chicagoans to embrace his Plan of Chicago that called for a remaking of the city through massive public and private initiatives. He knew that plans are often made and just as often ignored, {{and the most important}} reason <b>to</b> support and <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> <b>on</b> urban planning initiatives is that costs grow higher while problems unaddressed get worse. Burnham’s Plan, written with co-author Edward H.

While the successes of portions of Burnham and Bennett’s Plan are well-known, the areas where the plan were ignored show how costs grow and problems become more massive as time marches on. Daniel Burnham was the most respected and well-known architect and planner of his day. He began his career in Chicago with his first partner, John Root, designing homes for prominent business leaders. They branched out to designing railroad depots and tall commercial buildings. Their 1890 Rand McNally building was the first skyscraper built with an all-steel frame, a technological breakthrough that made possible the dizzying heights of our tallest structures today. After the premature death of Root from influenza in 1891, Burnham rose to international notoriety due to his successful supervision of the design and planning of the 1893 Worlds Fair, the Colombian Exposition. Twelve million people visited the fair that summer in Chicago, a figure equal to half the population of the United States at that time (Smith, 2006).

50|$|The Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 {{became a}} United States federal law (P.L.) 99-645 (100 Stat. 3582) on November 10, 1986. Prior to the Act the {{purchase}} of wetlands by the Federal Government had been prohibited. The Act allocated funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for {{the purchase of}} wetlands by the Secretary of Interior, who is head of the United States Department of the Interior. The Act also instituted a National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan which was to be established and set up by the Secretary. Included in this plan was a requirement for all States to include wetlands as part of their Comprehensive Outdoors Recreation plan. The plan also transferred the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund amounts which were to be equal to the import duties on arms and ammunition. The main purpose of the Act was <b>to</b> ensure a <b>follow</b> <b>through</b> <b>on</b> international obligations and fulfillment of these obligations on the various past and future migratory bird treaties. It also promoted the conservation of wetlands so the benefits they provide could be maintained. An extension of the Wetlands Loan Act of 1961 which had been established and approved on October 4, 1961 was also provided by the Act. Under this extension wetlands loan advances would be forgiven and it extend the appropriation through September 30, 1988. A requirement was outlined in the Act which instructed the Secretary to report to the United States Congress on all losses of wetlands. The Secretary was to also investigate these losses and outline his findings in these reports to provide information {{as to whether or not}} federal programs and/or polices contributed to any of the wetland losses. Other responsibilities tasked to the Secretary were to complete the mapping of all the wetlands in the contiguous United States and those in the non-contiguous portions of the U.S. by September 30, 1990. This was to be done in conjunction with inventorying all of the National Wetlands which were to be completed eight years later on September 30, 1998 with continuation at ten-year intervals thereafter. Updates were to be provided to previous reports to help update and improve the “Status and Trends of Wetlands and Deep-water Habitat in the Coterminous United States, 1950’s to 1970’s” from September 1982.|$|R
