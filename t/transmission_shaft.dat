500|$|The world's oldest {{illustrated}} {{depiction of}} an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It {{was used in}} the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions), as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical <b>transmission</b> <b>shaft,</b> incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring [...] was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD). From his horological treatise, Su Song states: ...|$|E

50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the <b>transmission</b> input <b>shafts</b> parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main <b>transmission</b> <b>shafts</b> which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|R
