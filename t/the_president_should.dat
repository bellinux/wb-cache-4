5|$|Lukashenko {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be a conservative person and avoid using modern electronic gadgets {{such as an}} iPad or iPhone. He used to play bayan and football, but abandoned both during his presidency. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward, who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars. His two elder sons also play hockey, sometimes alongside their father.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey {{on the morning of}} July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E

5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler {{was the first to}} see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E

25|$|I believe <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> {{be impeached}} and removed from office.

25|$|Formal {{negotiations}} on the salary and privileges of the permanent presidency began in April 2008 {{as part of the}} draft of the 2009 EU budget.

Premier Jiang met with demonstrators outside the legislature on March 22 but stated that the executive branch had no intention of dropping the trade pact.

25|$|In 1825, Polk {{ran for the}} United States House of Representatives in the Tennessee's 6th congressional district. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah {{began to}} worry about his health. During the campaign, Polk's opponents said that {{at the age of}} 29 Polk was too young for a spot in the House, but he won the {{election}} and took his seat in Congress. When Polk arrived in Washington, D.C. he roomed in Benjamin Burch's boarding house with some other Tennessee representatives, including Sam Houston. Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be elected by the popular vote. Polk became a vocal critic of the Adams administration, frequently voting against its policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{politicians}} and their parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian {{was linked to}} possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It {{eventually led to the}} creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader Shih Ming-teh which believes <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT's chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President, Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.|$|E
25|$|When {{either of}} the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the {{government}} feels the need for an immediate procedure, the President can promulgate ordinances which have the same force and effect as an act passed by Parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the Parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier. Under , the President as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and he is confident that the government commands majority support in the Parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and Parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of Parliament when in force and {{it is the responsibility of}} the President to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and President, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of ordinances after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the President. President should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which is violating the constitution or needs amendment to the constitution. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the Parliament or violating the constitution.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, in the English tradition, {{judges were}} seen as being agents of the King and his court, who {{represented}} him throughout his realm. Madison believed that in the American states, this direct link between state executives and judges {{was a source of}} corruption through patronage, and thought the link had to be severed between the two, thus creating the [...] "third branch" [...] of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point. Madison, however, did not believe that the judiciary should be truly independent, but rather beholden to the legislature rather than the executive. At the Convention, some sided with Madison that the legislature should choose judges, while others believed <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> choose judges. A compromise was eventually reached that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> choose judges and the Senate confirm them.|$|E

In addition to its own nuclear weapons, Britain had hosted American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers since 1948.

Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency." [...] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all.
