40|$|We extend {{transaction}} cost economics {{by examining the}} effect of relaxing two of its underlying assumptions. First, {{transaction cost}} economics relies on an assumption of risk neutrality. We argue <b>that</b> <b>organizations</b> transactions vary in the risk they impose on an <b>organization</b> and <b>that</b> <b>organizations</b> {{are more likely to}} embed riskier transactions within a hierarchy. Second, transaction cost economics assumes that transactions are independently organized. We argue <b>that</b> <b>organizations</b> have an underlying propensity to organize transactions through hierarchy or contracting and that this underlying propensity is related to an organization’s capabilities, such as absorptive capacity. The analysis shows <b>that</b> transaction <b>organization</b> is a function of transaction risk. Transaction risk, rather than uncertainty or firm asset specificity, is the most important factor determining transaction organization. And, the analysis shows <b>that</b> transaction <b>organization</b> is a function of an organization’s absorptive capacity and technological diversity. This means that transactions within an organization are interdependent...|$|R

5|$|One {{factor that}} helped Tillman and his {{movement}} in the 1890 campaign was the organization of many South Carolina farmers {{under the auspices of}} the Farmers' Alliance. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From <b>that</b> <b>organization</b> would come the People's Party (better known as the Populists). Although the Populist Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers' organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.|$|E

5|$|On March 7, 1859, he was {{nominated}} as U.S. District Judge for the District of Oregon by President James Buchanan. Two days later the United States Senate confirmed the nomination and Deady received his commission to the court that had been created once Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Deady held the first session of the court on September 12, 1859, in Salem, but had the court relocated to Portland {{by the start of}} the September session of 1860. Deady then moved to Portland where he helped to found the Multnomah County Library. He would serve as president of <b>that</b> <b>organization</b> for a number of years. In Portland, he wrote the articles of incorporation for the city, which became the standard in the state for other cities. At first Portland did not have a courthouse for Deady to use, so he rented two rooms from Benjamin Stark on what is now Water Street until a federal courthouse was built beginning in 1869. That courthouse was first named the United States Building, and is now named the Pioneer Courthouse, with Deady moving into the building when it was finished in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Tension between {{whites and}} Chinese {{immigrants}} in the late 19th century American West was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The Knights of Labor, {{one of the foremost}} voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of <b>that</b> <b>organization.</b> However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.|$|E
5|$|The Prieuré de Sion (French: IPA/API:), {{translated}} as Priory of Sion, is a fringe fraternal organisation, founded and dissolved in France in 1956 by Pierre Plantard {{as part of}} a hoax. In the 1960s, Plantard created a fictitious history for <b>that</b> <b>organization,</b> describing it as a secret society founded by Godfrey of Bouillon on Mount Zion in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099, conflating it with a genuine historical monastic order, the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion. In Plantard's version, the Priory was devoted to installing a secret bloodline of the Merovingian dynasty on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. This myth was expanded upon and popularised by the 1982 pseudohistorical book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and later claimed as factual in the preface of the 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code.|$|E
