5|$|On the {{day prior}} to the game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11.5 points. Despite that advantage, Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and {{the public about the}} threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies' chances of winning. Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest-tenured coaches in college {{football}} at the time. DeBerry had been a college coach for 19years, while Beamer had coached for 16 years. The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team {{for the first time since}} 1999. Ticket sales {{prior to the}} game were sluggish, as both teams failed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> their assigned allotments, and local sales registered fewer than 8,000tickets sold.

5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, the {{sandwich}} was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the national menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
5|$|Following a fall in game {{attendance}} in 2009 and 2010, Start decided {{ahead of the}} 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity. Advertisement banners were sold to cover the corners, thus reducing the capacity to 11,700 tickets. The club stated that the intention was to move spectators closer together to increase the atmosphere, {{and at the same}} time making it easier <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> the stadium. In February 2012, Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK6.4 million in value added tax on the naming rights. The club stated that they believed the naming rights were exempt. After the 2011 season, Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports. Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} the show, on November 23, Art Barr died in his home in Springfield, Oregon. The {{official}} {{cause of death was}} never officially confirmed, although it was claimed by some sources to be drug-related. Barr and Guerrero were the reigning AAA World Tag Team Champions at the time of Barr's death and AAA opted to retire the championship instead of vacating the championship and finding new champions. Between 1994 and 2007 AAA's primary championship was the Mexican National Tag Team Championship, until AAA brought back the AAA World Tag Team Championship at the 2007 Rey de Reyes show on March 18, 2007. Following When Worlds Collide, AAA owner Antonio Peña was working on a storyline that would have Barr and Guerrero turn on Konnan, turning Konnan tecnico in the process. The start of the storyline was planted during the show, as Barr was not at ringside to help Konnan during the match. The conclusion of the storyline would come at Triplemanía III at Estadio Azteca, where AAA was hoping <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> the 130,000 seat arena.|$|E

The series' strongest sales base has been Japan: in 2007, sales distribution was 87% in Japan, 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and 2% in mainland Asia.

The sales data did not include mobile and online games. The success of entries has also been linked with the consoles they are released on: Vesperias release on the Xbox 360 caused the console <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> {{for the first time in}} Japan, while Namco decided to release Zestiria on the PlayStation 3 due to the low sales prospects for next-gen consoles in their target audience.

5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since {{the morning of}} February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out</b> all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the game, the Welsh manager Mike England was unhappy {{that the game}} was to be played at Ninian Park in Cardiff instead of the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. Wales at the time had an {{excellent}} record at the Racecourse, both in qualifying tournaments for the World Cup and European Championships, and in the British Home Championship. During the early 1970s, Wrexham had embarked on making significant improvements to the Racecourse, with two new stands built and a new roof installed over the Kop End. Ninian Park however had had its capacity cut {{as a result of}} various safety inspections until improvements were made. The smaller capacity of the Racecourse additionally meant that home games were more likely <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>out.</b> This had led to the FAW choosing the Racecourse {{for the majority of the}} national team's home games from 1977 onwards. Before the game against Scotland, Wales had played twenty home games since the beginning of 1980, with eight each of those played at Cardiff and Wrexham. Of those, Wales had won 6 and drawn 2, including two wins against England, and the 3–0 victory over Spain earlier in the qualifying tournament at the Racecourse, while they had won 3, drawn 2 and lost 3 at Ninian Park. However, in spite of Wales' exceptional record at the Racecourse, the interest in the game led to the FAW to name the larger Ninian Park as the venue.|$|E
