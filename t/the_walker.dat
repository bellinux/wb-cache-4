5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control the motion of <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> along the track using control strands {{that need to be}} manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by <b>the</b> <b>walker.</b> The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

5|$|Rick {{approaches}} Hershel about <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> in <b>the</b> barn, but Hershel {{refuses to}} allow them to harm <b>the</b> <b>walkers.</b> He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> back.|$|R
40|$|Diferent {{types of}} random walkers are studied by {{assuming}} {{that they have}} eight diferent possibilities to make steps in pre-determined directions. <b>The</b> <b>walkers</b> {{are not allowed to}} step on already visited places in <b>the</b> plane (self-avoiding <b>walkers).</b> <b>The</b> main variables chosen to depict their behavior are the number of steps and the distance they reach before they are trapped. A measure of how <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> are difused, an index of how the paths of <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> are folded and the efect of restricting the region where <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> may walk are also studied. ...|$|R

The {{objective}} is to hold off <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> {{as long as possible}} before they blow up the power generator at the Rebels' Echo Base. The difficulty levels included several variables, including the initial speed of <b>the</b> <b>walkers,</b> whether or not <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> were solid, and whether or not <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> included a [...] "smart bomb".|$|R

5|$|A play, The Automaton Chess Player, was {{presented}} in New York City in 1845.

5|$|After World War II the {{railways}} were run down, with Operation Phoenix unveiled in 1950, involving {{the expenditure of}} £80 million over 10 years.

50|$|The second snowspeeder {{sequence}} {{involves the}} assault of AT-AT and AT-ST <b>walkers</b> against <b>the</b> Rebel shield generator. <b>The</b> <b>walkers</b> {{have to be}} either destroyed or avoided, as collisions will damage the aircraft. The player has four tow-cables {{which can be used}} to take down <b>the</b> AT-AT <b>walkers</b> instantly if fired at <b>the</b> <b>walker's</b> legs. Otherwise, <b>the</b> player has to aim for the red cockpits in order to destroy <b>the</b> <b>walkers.</b> To earn a Jedi letter, the player must eradicate the specified number of walkers.|$|R

The group has demonstrated annually at Tate Britain against the Turner Prize since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the Charles Saatchi-patronised Young British Artists.|$|E
5|$|Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go out {{in search}} of Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz), {{following}} her mother Carol (Melissa McBride) weeping for her loss. Daryl tells Andrea about his childhood, and expresses {{hope that they will}} successfully locate Sophia. They stumble upon an abandoned campsite, where a person had committed suicide by hanging themselves from a tree and now has become an undead walker. Daryl insists that they leave <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> alone, but Andrea firmly refuses. He asks her if she wants to continue living, to which she exclaims uncertainty. Daryl euthanizes <b>the</b> <b>walker</b> as they leave. Upon returning to the camp, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) attempts to reconcile with Andrea by returning her handgun.|$|E
5|$|From 1869 at the latest, {{the company}} owning <b>the</b> <b>Walker</b> Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the {{tunnelling}} shield and iron castings to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow.|$|E

In 2003, an allied group, Stuckism Photography, was founded by Larry Dunstan and Andy Bullock. In 2005 the Stuckists offered a donation of 175 paintings from <b>the</b> <b>Walker</b> show to the Tate, but it was rejected by the Tate's trustees.|$|E
5|$|Losh, Wilson & Bell's first {{ironworks}} {{was founded}} in 1809 at Walker, beside the alkali works, carrying out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines. By 1818, George Stephenson's original wooden wagonway was completely relaid with cast-iron edge-rails made in collaboration between Stephenson, who owned the patent, and Losh, Wilson and Bell. Around 1821, George Stephenson was briefly a partner in <b>the</b> <b>Walker</b> Ironworks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Walker</b> Art Center was {{established}} in 1927 as the first public art gallery in the Upper Midwest. In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker {{made it possible to}} acquire works by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, and others. The museum continued its focus on modern art with traveling shows in the 1960s.|$|E

Negotiations with the Ministry of labour, family and social affairs, special care homes, nongovernmental organizations and local authorities had started. Agency IN has been the only nongovernmental organization that has been willing to provide care for <b>the</b> <b>walkers.</b> <b>The</b> lives of <b>the</b> <b>walkers</b> have changed dramatically. The resettlement to Ljubljana has been a challenge for <b>the</b> <b>walkers,</b> their social workers and volunteers. The solidarity that has been created during the movement provided them with enough support and help to realise most of their goals. The movement enabled them to make friends and live in the community. While experiencing a lot of successes in their lives, obstacles have been encountered. Inadequate laws and the passivity of the ministry of social affairs has been one of the most oblivious...|$|R

Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any Day Now. A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman. Eric Clapton covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration.

5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s.

Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American Museum of Natural History or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of <b>the</b> <b>Walker</b> fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum of Natural History).|$|E
