500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband, Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. While writing the songs for Like a Prayer, Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed-the-Plow. In the play, she portrayed Karen, a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends. Karen later gets revenge, but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as {{the men who had}} partaken in this bet and exploited her. Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception, which she vented into her lyrics. The result was a set of three songs—"Till Death Do Us Part", [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Oh Father"—where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons. Written with producer Patrick Leonard, in [...] "Oh Father" [...] the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father. Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment, Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind [...] "Oh Father", except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel, her favorite band at that time. She added, [...] " [...] is what the listener thinks it is, all open to interpretation. I just wrote the song, it's up to others to interpret them to mean what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to mean." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{traveling}} with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 {{that led to a}} seven-year contract with Warner Brothers studios.

6000|$|Thereupon Judge Douglas {{and others}} began to argue {{in favor of}} [...] "popular sovereignty," [...] {{the right of the}} people to have slaves if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them,</b> and to exclude slavery if <b>they</b> did not <b>want</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "But," [...] said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), [...] "we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to; and if you do mean it, accept an {{amendment}} which I propose, expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery." ...|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{two were}} asked by their husbands how <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> during the day: {{as they are}} during the day, or as they are at night. Both <b>want</b> <b>them</b> as <b>they</b> are during the day. Their husbands both are men during the day but seals at night. The {{youngest}} was also asked and answered the same, so her husband was a dog by day and a handsome man by night.|$|R

60|$|The Judge {{says that}} the people of the Territories have the right, by his principle, to have slaves, if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them.</b> Then I say that the people in Georgia have the right to buy slaves in Africa, if they want them; and I defy any man on earth to show any {{distinction}} between the two things,--to show that the one is either more wicked or more unlawful; to show, on original principles, that one is better or worse than the other; or to show, by the Constitution, that one differs a whit from the other. He will tell me, doubtless, that there is no constitutional provision against people taking slaves into the new Territories, and I tell him that there is equally no constitutional provision against buying slaves in Africa. He will tell you that a people, in the exercise of popular sovereignty, ought to do as they please about that thing, and have slaves if they want them; and I tell you {{that the people of}} Georgia are as much entitled to popular sovereignty and to buy slaves in Africa, if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them,</b> as the people of the Territory are to have slaves if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them.</b> I ask any man, dealing honestly with himself, to point out a distinction.|$|E

5000|$|The Garinagu {{people had}} an {{ambivalent}} {{relationship with the}} Baymen. While the Baymen valued the Garinagu's agricultural skills, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to submit to European control and help capture refugee slaves. The Baymen began a campaign of misinformation, saying the Garinagu had practices of [...] "devil worshipping" [...] and [...] "baby eating." [...] This poisoned relationships between the Creoles and [...] "Kerobs", as they were derogatorily called.|$|R
6000|$|I {{say that}} Douglas's popular sovereignty, {{establishing}} his sacred {{right in the}} people, if you please, if carried to its logical conclusion gives equally the sacred right {{to the people of}} the States or the Territories themselves to buy slaves wherever they can buy them cheapest; and if any man can show a distinction, I should like to hear him try it. If any man can show how the people of Kansas have a better right to slaves, because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them,</b> than the people of Georgia have to buy them in Africa, I want him to do it. I think it cannot be done. If it is [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] for the people to have slaves because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them,</b> it is popular sovereignty for them to buy them in Africa because they desire to do so.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sir?" [...] said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself. One of the rummy {{things about}} Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him {{come into a}} room. He's {{like one of those}} weird chappies in India who {{dissolve}} themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them.</b> I've got a cousin who's what they call a Theosophist, and he says he's often nearly worked the thing himself, but couldn't quite bring it off, probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie.|$|E

25|$|After the Freedom Rides, {{students}} and activists of the Freedom Movement launched {{a series of}} merchant boycotts, sit-ins and protest marches, from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers. For instance, at the time, department stores did not hire black salesclerks or allow black customers to use their fitting rooms to try on clothes, or lunch counters for meals while in the store, but <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to shop in their stores.|$|R
50|$|The 50-year run of marketing-centric, inward facing {{organizational}} structure was over. Gone {{were the days}} of making a product, with businesses telling consumers only the information <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to know {{in order to create}} awareness and drive them into the store, and then making sure the retailer got his product order. Fueled by consumers empowered by globalization and technology, marketing-centric has replaced with consumer-centric, an outward facing organization structure that’s concerned with being there for the consumer wherever, whenever, and with whatever <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to know at any point in their journey to purchase.|$|R
60|$|The Bishop {{has just}} spoken of a {{condition}} of things which {{none of us can}} deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain--a lust which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish its ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are clean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don't have things the way <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>them?</b> I'll tell you why it is. A good deal has been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by organization. That's just the thing. It's because the fiftieth fellow and his pals are organized and the other forty-nine are not that the dirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time.|$|E

Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again. Because points are subtracted each time Spidy dies, the problems with the control scheme exacerbate {{how difficult it is to}} get enough stars to progress.|$|R

Eventually, the beams could be inclined by a controlled amount which enabled the British to fool the Germans into dropping their bombs where <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them.</b> A side effect was that as the German crews had been trained to navigate solely by the beams, many crews failed to find either the true equi-signal or Germany again.
