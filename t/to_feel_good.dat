5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts {{that are associated with}} the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E
25|$|People {{who support}} and found reasons <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> over these {{incidents}} are {{doing more than}} one wrong thing: first, ignoring the tragedy of killing an innocent group of people. Second, not thinking about the reaction of showing they found satisfaction in the incidents. Third, they are considered accomplices in the crime. Fourth, they are committing a wrongful act not approved by religion.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energies}} {{and renewable energy}} technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts. These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about working for such a company. A happier workforce is a more productive workforce.|$|E

When Geet's {{grandfather}} (Dara Singh) sees them both together, he thinks that they are a couple and that they are in love with each other. But no one seems to believe him. Aditya has fallen in love with Geet but is aware that Geet loves Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Geet decides to elope with Anshuman as she is sure that her family wouldn't agree for their marriage as their religions are different. When she escapes from her house along with Aditya, her family thinks that they both eloped. They go to Manali, where Anshuman resides. Geet requests Aditya to come with her and meet Anshuman, but he says that their journey together is over and bids her farewell, and the two part ways.|$|E
500|$|Quotes in {{the film}} aided its popularity. Titanic catchphrase [...] "I'm {{the king of the}} world!" [...] became one of the film industry's more popular quotations. According to Richard Harris, a {{psychology}} professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others.

Braile agrees that the book could be [...] "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a [...] "Jeremiad" [...] ultimately gave it a positive review.

2500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Fly" [...] began during {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in 1990. The song's origins {{can be traced}} to a demo recorded there, which eventually evolved into the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head." [...] The demo was among the material that was bootlegged from the Berlin sessions and released as Salome: The Axtung Beibi Sessions. In 1991, the album's recording sessions moved to the seaside mansion [...] "Elsinore" [...] in Dalkey, where the group continued to work on the demo. It was troublesome, but it inspired portions of three separate songs, [...] "The Fly" [...] being one of them, and [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station" [...] being the other two.

Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should [...] "try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. [...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s.
