5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from <b>their</b> <b>institutions</b> and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E

25|$|It is not random that medieval {{ages and}} <b>their</b> <b>institutions</b> were idolised. Modern {{aristocracy}} was {{strongly associated with}} foreignness, more specifically with Denmark and the Dano-Norwegian union (15241814). Medieval aristocracy, however, satisfied nationalists' desire for ('true', 'pure') Norwegianness. The search for genuine Norwegianness was, however, a general trait of Norwegian romantic nationalism. A young and small nation sought pride in its mighty history.|$|E

25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics.

They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E
