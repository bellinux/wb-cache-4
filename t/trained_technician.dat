5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a <b>trained</b> <b>technician.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} system consists of three components: the implanted pulse generator (IPG), the lead, and an extension. The IPG is a battery-powered neurostimulator encased in a titanium housing, which sends electrical pulses to the brain that interferes with neural activity at the target site. The lead is a coiled wire insulated in polyurethane with four platinum-iridium electrodes and is placed {{in one or two}} different nuclei of the brain. The lead is connected to the IPG by an extension, an insulated wire that runs below the skin, from the head, {{down the side of the}} neck, behind the ear to the IPG, which is placed subcutaneously below the clavicle or, in some cases, the abdomen. The IPG can be calibrated by a neurologist, nurse, or <b>trained</b> <b>technician</b> to optimize symptom suppression and control side-effects.|$|E

50|$|Although MCA cards cost {{nearly double}} the price of {{comparable}} non-MCA cards, the marketing stressed that it was simple for any user to upgrade or add more cards to their PC, thus saving the considerable expense of a technician. In this critical area, Micro Channel architecture's biggest advantage was also its greatest disadvantage, {{and one of the}} major reasons for its demise. To add a new card (video, printer, memory, network, modem, etc.) the user simply plugged in the MCA card and inserted a customized floppy disk (that came with the PC) to blend the new card into the original hardware automatically, rather than bringing in an expensive <b>trained</b> <b>technician</b> who could manually make all the needed changes. All choices for interrupts (an often perplexing problem) and other changes were accomplished automatically by the PC reading the old configuration from the floppy disk, which made necessary changes in software, then wrote the new configuration to the floppy disk. In practice, however, this meant that the user must keep that same floppy disk matched to that PC. For a small company with a few PCs, this was annoying, but practical. But for large organizations with hundreds or even thousands of PCs, permanently matching each PC with its own floppy disk was logistically unlikely or impossible. Without the original, updated floppy disk, no changes could be made to the PC's cards. After this experience repeated itself thousands of times, business leaders realized their dream scenario for upgrade simplicity did not work in the corporate world, and they sought a better process.|$|E

50|$|The printer {{contains}} melted wax when at operating temperature, and owners' manuals {{warn that}} it cannot be moved {{until it has}} completed a special cool-down cycle selected from the machine's control panel. It is recommended to provide a 30-minute cool down time {{from the point of}} removing main power, however all modern solid-ink printers have a shutdown cycle which use fans to solidify the ink in less than ten minutes, with the added benefit of physically restraining the printhead to prevent damage during moving or shipping. The manuals warn that substantial damage is possible otherwise, requiring servicing by a <b>trained</b> <b>technician</b> if not properly cooled down before moving the printer. Moving the printer before cool down completes can damage the print head by spilling molten ink between reservoirs of different color as well as over other components inside the printer (motors, belts, etc.), and is not covered under maintenance or warranty. Because of the liquid-ink-spillage concern, solid-ink printers are not suitable for mobile usage, such as on movable carts for printing pricing tags in retail settings. Unlike some inkjet printers where the cartridge includes the print head, the printhead in these printers is fixed. Over time, parts of the printhead may become permanently clogged, resulting in unsightly streaks, but there are printhead and drum cleaning cycles and jet-substitution options which can resolve most printing issues. There is a filter for the ingested ink implemented at least on the recent ColorQube devices (8570/8870), according to a service manual for those models. Dust caused by the use of cheap paper may cause printhead clogging, which is why Xerox recommends the use of papers that are not prone to giving off dust and fibers during regular usage. Paper dust may also accumulate as debris inside the printer; this could cause abrasions on the drum and may mimic a weak or missing jet. For this reason, the basic built-in drum-cleaning procedure is therefore recommended to be invoked at least three times before initiating printhead-nozzle cleaning cycle. The printhead system also contains a wiper-assembly unit that is used to wipe the printhead from dust, debris and residual ink, {{in order to protect the}} nozzles from clogging. Overall, the design of this system is robust: printheads have been known to last one million prints or more. Ink blocks are not compatible between Phaser models, due to Xerox changing each CMYK molded shape with each new model release due to changes in the formulation (and especially melt point) of the ink. Special openings prevent the insertion of ink sticks from the wrong model, or the wrong slot. Lamination becomes difficult due to the nature of the ink technology. The ink melts and becomes smeared unless the laminator temperature is reduced to just enough to seal a pouch.|$|E
40|$|In {{diagnosing}} {{a failed}} system, a smart technician would choose tests {{to be performed}} based on the context of the situation. Currently, test program sets do not fault-. isolate {{within the context of a}} situation. Instead, testing follows a rigid, predetermined, fault-isolation sequence that is based on an embedded fault tree. Current test programs do not tolerate instrument failure and cannot redirect testing by incorporating new information. However, there is a new approach to automatic testing that emulates the best features of a <b>trained</b> <b>technician</b> yet, unlike the development of rule-based expert systems, does not require a <b>trained</b> <b>technician</b> to build the knowledge base. This new approach is model-based and has evolved over the last 10 years. This evolution has led to the development of several maintenance tools and an architecture for intelligent automatic test equipment (ATE). The architecture has been implemented for testing two cards from an AV- 8 B power supply...|$|E

Just as the training and accreditation of practical nurses have elevated standards of the registered nurses and freed them from routine duties, so could the training and accreditation of library technicians favorably affect programs of librarians. Courses have been given to assist untrained personnel supervising small libraries. However, our goals should be (1) to <b>train</b> <b>technicians</b> to perform nonprofessional library tasks; (2) to set standards for accreditation, ensuring a clear differentiation, one obvious to the librarian, the technician, and the administrator; (3) to advise administrators of the possibilities of developing small but effective libraries under a local system, using a trained librarian as supervisor and <b>trained</b> <b>technicians</b> in individual institutions; (4) to persuade doubting administrators of the worth of an efficient library.
