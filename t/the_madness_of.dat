5|$|Fox {{divided the}} {{patients}} at Brislington House according to social class, '1st', '2nd' and '3rd' class ladies and gentlemen, who were housed in different blocks, {{as well as}} behavioural presentation. Fox insisted that patients should be separated from their families as they needed {{to move away from}} the conventional authority of the head of the household following <b>the</b> <b>madness</b> <b>of</b> King George III. It had erroneously been suggested that the king become a patient at Brislington House.|$|E
5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and <b>the</b> <b>Madness</b> <b>of</b> Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and <b>the</b> <b>Madness</b> <b>of</b> Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E

Among other descendants of George III theorized by the authors of Purple Secret to have suffered from porphyria (based on analysis of their extensive and detailed medical correspondence) were his great-great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Prussia (Emperor William II's eldest sister) and her daughter Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. They uncovered better evidence that George III's great-great-great-grandson Prince William of Gloucester was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria.|$|E
