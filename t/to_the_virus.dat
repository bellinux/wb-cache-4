5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown to be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E

40|$|From {{the lungs}} of two fatal cases {{and from the}} sputum of two non-fatal cases of {{atypical}} bronchopneumonia, a psittacosis-like virus was isolated by direct intranasal inoculation of mice. Intraperitoneal injection of the same human material into mice gave negative results. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> has a relatively high virulence for mice by intranasal or intra-cerebral inoculation, but does not kill after intraperitoneal inoculation. Its virulence for Java ricebirds is low and it fails to produce a carrier state in mice and birds. Two cases showed an increase in complement-fixing antibodies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new <b>virus</b> and <b>to</b> psittacosis. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> is antigenically related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of meningopneumonitis and psittacosis by complement fixation and by active immunity tests in mice...|$|R
5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} <b>to</b> recreate <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> from existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used <b>to</b> recreate <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> first step <b>to</b> mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> remaining <b>virus</b> stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of the TgPVR mouse has {{had a profound effect}} on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.|$|E

He is immune <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and uses vials of his blood to try to create a cure.|$|E
5|$|After Monica Dawson (Dana Davis) is {{captured}} by a street gang, Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey) {{turns to his}} mother Niki (Ali Larter) for help. Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes.|$|E

5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In Atlanta, {{representatives of}} the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) of the CDC and express fears that the disease is a bio weapon {{intended}} to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources for a proper public health response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Dr. Mears later becomes infected and dies.|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} are categorized as systemic, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{spread of the}} disease throughout the plant. Once <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> enters <b>the</b> plant through the root cells via Polymyxa graminis it is able to multiply and spread throughout the plant.

5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
40|$|The {{infection}} of cats by <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> of infectious feline agranulocytosis {{is followed by}} the production of specific neutralizing and protective antibodies, and recovery from the disease is associated with the development of solid immunity <b>to</b> reinfection. From <b>the</b> evidence presented it is obvious that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is not related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of hog cholera, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, fox encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis, the Western type of equine encephalomyelitis, herpes, and B virus infection...|$|R

Pavel Morozov, a captured Red Line soldier, and Artyom escape through the Metro tunnels and across the devastated surface. When they reach the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they are exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E

5000|$|On February 14, 1977, Victoria Pratt {{came into}} contact with Shanti Suresh. Through an {{extraction}} of Shanti's blood, Pratt discovered <b>the</b> Shanti <b>virus.</b> Pratt, a biological engineer, began <b>to</b> experiment on <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> by Company orders. <b>The</b> Company hoped <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>to</b> eliminate those who have abilities that are too dangerous. Pratt manages <b>to</b> manipulate <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and create strain 138, capable of killing 93% of the world's population, if not more. Pratt recognizes this danger. On November 2, 1977 Monroe attempted <b>to</b> steal <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of creating holocausts and plagues <b>to</b> help save <b>the</b> world, believing that he was a god.

5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most {{human and animal}} herpesviruses, the trunk secretions may {{be a source of}} transmission for EEHVs. Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens on}} May 1, 2017, when a {{blackout}} occurs in LeMU, its communications system go down, {{and the park}} springs a leak; portions of it get flooded, blocking the exit and trapping the characters inside. Due to water pressure, the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming, as it would crush their lungs. If the player plays as Takeshi, he builds a relationship with Tsugumi, who reveals {{that she and her}} pet hamster Chami are carriers of the Cure virus, which has rewritten their genetic code, and halted their biological aging. She and Takeshi have sex, and she is impregnated. Later, Coco becomes sick. It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU, called IBF, and that LeMU was created by the Leiblich Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF. The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it. Coco was exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> while visiting her father, an IBF researcher.|$|E
