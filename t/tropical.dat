5|$|A <b>tropical</b> {{disturbance}} formed east of Chuuk on July 31 {{and gradually}} increased in organization {{over the next}} several days as it moved northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a <b>tropical</b> depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a <b>tropical</b> storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it <b>Tropical</b> Storm Saomai.|$|E
5|$|A <b>tropical</b> {{disturbance}} {{is named}} {{when it reaches}} moderate <b>tropical</b> storm strength. If a <b>tropical</b> disturbance reaches moderate <b>tropical</b> storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a <b>tropical</b> disturbance reaches moderate <b>tropical</b> storm status between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-regional <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year so no names are retired.|$|E

5|$|A <b>tropical</b> wave {{developed}} into <b>Tropical</b> Depression Thirteen on October 3, 115mi (185km/h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified into a <b>tropical</b> storm, and {{was classified as}} <b>Tropical</b> Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was {{in an area of}} weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified into a hurricane, and passed only 12mi (19km) east of Barbuda later that day. By the following day, Klaus had weakened back into a <b>tropical</b> storm. After weakening to a <b>tropical</b> storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to a <b>tropical</b> depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified into a <b>tropical</b> storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop into <b>Tropical</b> Storm Marco.|$|E
5|$|A <b>tropical</b> wave {{developed}} into a <b>tropical</b> depression near Tobago on August7. The system then passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August8, the <b>tropical</b> depression strengthened into a <b>tropical</b> storm. On August9, the storm strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane, while positioned south of Dominican Republic. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90mph (150km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening and fell to <b>tropical</b> storm intensity on August12. By midday on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the storm began to re-strengthen. Early on August13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong <b>tropical</b> storm. Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the <b>tropical</b> storm slowly deteriorated, falling to <b>tropical</b> depression intensity on August15 and dissipating over West Virginia on August17.|$|E
5|$|A <b>tropical</b> wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 1. It {{steadily}} organized as it moved westward, and resembled a <b>tropical</b> depression by July 7. However, surface reports and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the system did not have <b>tropical</b> characteristics, and remained simply a low-pressure system. The wave produced <b>tropical</b> storm-force winds as it moved through the Lesser Antilles on July 8, but did not acquire <b>tropical</b> characteristics until it reached the eastern Caribbean. Because it had <b>tropical</b> storm-force winds, the system was upgraded immediately to <b>Tropical</b> Storm Claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on July 8.|$|E
5|$|After its peak, Guillermo {{weakened}} to <b>tropical</b> storm {{status as}} it began losing convection. It subsequently weakened to a <b>tropical</b> depression and dissipated after that on August 10. There were no damages or casualties associated with this <b>tropical</b> cyclone.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 86 <b>tropical</b> {{cyclones}} of <b>tropical</b> storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense <b>tropical</b> cyclones (at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale).|$|E
5|$|Ana was the {{earliest}} Atlantic subtropical or <b>tropical</b> cyclone since 2003's <b>Tropical</b> Storm Ana, which formed on April20. It was also {{the earliest}} <b>tropical</b> cyclone on record to make landfall in the United States. A storm in 1952 was thought to have made landfall as a <b>tropical</b> system much earlier, on February 3, but recent reanalysis efforts revealed that the storm was not fully <b>tropical</b> until after clearing Florida.|$|E
5|$|Arthur was {{the first}} <b>tropical</b> storm to form in May in the Atlantic since <b>Tropical</b> Storm Arlene in 1981, and the last until <b>Tropical</b> Storm Alberto in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Tropical</b> Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released <b>tropical</b> storm {{watches and}} warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the <b>tropical</b> depression formed on July 5, the government issued a <b>tropical</b> storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked {{to keep an eye on}} the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a <b>tropical</b> storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier <b>tropical</b> storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a <b>tropical</b> storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the <b>tropical</b> storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining <b>tropical</b> storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the <b>tropical</b> depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen <b>tropical</b> cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I <b>tropical</b> cyclone {{committee}} held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 <b>tropical</b> cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak <b>Tropical</b> Depression, Moderate <b>Tropical</b> Depression and Severe <b>Tropical</b> Depression would be changed to <b>Tropical</b> Depression, Moderate <b>Tropical</b> Storm and Severe <b>Tropical</b> Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 <b>tropical</b> cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant <b>tropical</b> cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as <b>tropical</b> cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most <b>tropical</b> {{cyclones}} {{that developed}} within the season occurred within the Coral Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} <b>tropical</b> cyclones {{that occurred during the}} year, with only 5 <b>tropical</b> cyclones occurring within the basin. During December 24, <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed to the south of New Caledonia and weakened below <b>tropical</b> cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|Besides the <b>tropical</b> {{storms and}} hurricanes this season, {{there were four}} {{additional}} <b>tropical</b> depressions that {{did not make a}} landfall anywhere. <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Four formed on July2 and dissipated the next day. It was the <b>tropical</b> cyclone to come closest to crossing 140°W and entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility this year. <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Thirteen formed on September12 and lasted four days. <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Seventeen formed October16 and dissipated a day later. <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Nineteen, the penultimate system of the season, formed on November 1 and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Climatologically, <b>tropical</b> {{cyclones}} are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the <b>tropical</b> North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer <b>tropical</b> easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many <b>tropical</b> cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, <b>tropical</b> cyclogenesis is influenced less by <b>tropical</b> easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, <b>tropical</b> cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Darby, now losing <b>tropical</b> characteristics, was {{downgraded}} to a <b>tropical</b> depression on July 9.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, several <b>tropical</b> systems {{affected}} Arizona {{even after}} losing all <b>tropical</b> characteristics. However, two hurricanes survived {{long enough to}} reach Arizona while still considered <b>tropical</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|During this season, 14tropical {{depressions}} formed {{of which}} seven attained <b>tropical</b> storm status. One <b>tropical</b> storm was operationally {{classified as a}} <b>tropical</b> depression but was reclassified in post-analysis. Three <b>tropical</b> cyclones reached hurricane status of which only one became a major hurricane, which is a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Emily was the costliest storm of the season, causing $80.3million in damage (1987USD) as it ravaged the Dominican Republic and Bermuda. <b>Tropical</b> Depression Fourteen was the deadliest storm of the season, causing six deaths as it passed across Jamaica. Of the seven cyclones that attained <b>tropical</b> storm status, three did not affect land.|$|E
5|$|During this season, {{the first}} <b>tropical</b> cyclone formed on March 16, {{and the last}} one {{dissipated}} on December 12. A total of 29 <b>tropical</b> depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 25 became <b>tropical</b> storms. 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. Two-thirds of the <b>tropical</b> cyclones formed between July and October. Typhoon Pamela was the longest-lived <b>tropical</b> cyclone of the season. Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles, with eight moving through the Philippines. <b>Tropical</b> cyclones accounted for 35percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong, their fifth wettest <b>tropical</b> cyclone contribution on record at the time. Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy moving through the Philippines and Vietnam in October.|$|E
5|$|Following Nate's {{declaration}} as a <b>tropical</b> cyclone, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} <b>tropical</b> storm warning stretching from Chilitepec to Celestún, noting that <b>tropical</b> storm conditions were likely within 12 hours. Early on September 8, a <b>tropical</b> storm watch was issued from Celestún to Progreso. A day later, a <b>tropical</b> storm watches were issued from La Cruz to Tampico and Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto. A hurricane watch was issued from Tampico to Veracruz, and three hours later, all <b>tropical</b> storm warnings were discontinued. On September10, the <b>tropical</b> storm watch stretching from Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto was discontinued, and a <b>tropical</b> storm warning was issued from Tampico to Punta El Lagarto. By 1500UTC, all <b>tropical</b> storm watches were discontinued, and at 2100UTC, the <b>tropical</b> storm warning area was modified to Tampico to Tuxpan. At this time, the hurricane watch area was modified to Tampico to Tuxpan, and a hurricane warning was issued from Tampico to Veracruz. The following day, this hurricane warning {{was changed to}} a <b>tropical</b> storm warning following Nate's weakening trend. All hurricane watches were discontinued, and during the afternoon hours, all <b>tropical</b> storm warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Forming at 31° N, {{the storm}} formed farther north {{than any other}} Pacific <b>tropical</b> cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Wene formed farther to the north. The cyclone marked the first known {{occurrence}} of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a <b>tropical</b> cyclone, though <b>Tropical</b> Storm Fausto in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane. The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40° N, a record for a Pacific hurricane. Only <b>Tropical</b> Storm Dot in 1970, Hurricane John in 1994, <b>Tropical</b> Depression Guillermo in 1997, and <b>Tropical</b> Storm Wene in 2000 were <b>tropical</b> cyclones north of the latitude, of which only John was a hurricane; none maintained <b>tropical</b> cyclone status further north than the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} {{flooding}} {{are the primary}} problem associated with <b>tropical</b> cyclones across the Pelican State. Recent examples of flooding across the state from <b>tropical</b> cyclones include <b>Tropical</b> Storm Allison in 2001, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Frances in 1998, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Allison in 1989, and <b>Tropical</b> Storm Claudette in 1979. Three of the four systems stalled across eastern Texas, prolonging the rainfall which occurred over Louisiana. If {{it were not for}} the intermittent invasions from <b>tropical</b> cyclones, rainfall during the months of August, September, and October would average about 25% less than it currently does.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fausto was a {{long-lived}} <b>tropical</b> cyclone {{that formed}} during the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. The eighth <b>tropical</b> cyclone and fifth named storm of the season, Fausto developed on August21 from a <b>tropical</b> wave that {{had crossed the}} Atlantic, and entered the Pacific on August 17. Becoming a <b>tropical</b> depression, the system intensified, and quickly became <b>Tropical</b> Storm Fausto early on August22. Fausto rapidly intensified, and was already a hurricane on that same day as becoming a <b>tropical</b> storm. Rapid intensification continued, and the <b>tropical</b> cyclone ultimately peaked as a strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. At that time, the winds 145mph (230km/h). Fausto began to gradually weaken after attaining peak intensity on August24, and was eventually downgraded to a <b>tropical</b> storm two days later. Weakening continued, and Fausto degenerated into a remnant low on August28 while well northeast of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{fourth and}} final <b>tropical</b> cyclone to strike Mexico at {{hurricane}} intensity during the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. The thirteenth <b>tropical</b> cyclone, eighth named storm, and fifth hurricane of the season, Hernan developed as a <b>tropical</b> depression from a <b>tropical</b> wave {{to the south of}} Mexico on September 30. The depression quickly strengthened, and became <b>Tropical</b> Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan curved north-northwestward the following day, before eventually turning north-northeastward. Still offshore of the Mexican coast on October 2, Hernan intensified into a hurricane. Six hours later, Hernan attained its peak as an 85mph (140km/h) Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). After weakening somewhat, on 1000 UTC October 3, Hurricane Hernan made landfall near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, with winds of 75mph (120km/h). Only two hours after landfall, Hernan weakened to a <b>tropical</b> storm. By October 4, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Hernan had weakened into a <b>tropical</b> depression, and dissipated over Nayarit on the following day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes {{that affect}} California are mainly the {{remnants}} of hurricanes or <b>tropical</b> storms. In the twentieth century, only four eastern Pacific <b>tropical</b> cyclones have brought <b>tropical</b> storm-force winds to the Continental United States: the 1939 Long Beach <b>Tropical</b> Storm, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Joanne in 1972, <b>Tropical</b> Storm Kathleen in 1976, and <b>Tropical</b> Storm Nora in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 <b>tropical</b> storms, there were several <b>tropical</b> depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A <b>tropical</b> depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the <b>tropical</b> system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a <b>tropical</b> storm. Originally, there was a <b>tropical</b> storm in the database in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a <b>tropical</b> depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a <b>tropical</b> storm in the database in late September, but it was also downgraded to a <b>tropical</b> depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the named storms, the MFR tracked seven <b>tropical</b> disturbances and two <b>tropical</b> depressions throughout the year. Most were short lived, often receiving few warnings. The first two systems developed before <b>Tropical</b> Storm Antoinette in October.|$|E
5|$|In late September, three <b>tropical</b> {{disturbances}} moved westward {{across the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a <b>tropical</b> depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to <b>Tropical</b> Storm Monica. The <b>tropical</b> storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then gradually weakened. It became a <b>tropical</b> depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with <b>Tropical</b> Storm Monica.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>tropical</b> {{cyclones}} develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire <b>tropical</b> characteristics. <b>Tropical</b> systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the <b>tropical</b> disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the <b>tropical</b> cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A <b>tropical</b> cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A <b>tropical</b> cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|May 29–30, 2016– <b>Tropical</b> {{moisture}} from <b>Tropical</b> Storm Bonnie brought widespread rainfall across the state.|$|E
5|$|Not much <b>tropical</b> {{activity}} {{occurs during}} the month of July, but the majority of hurricane seasons see the formation of one <b>tropical</b> cyclone during July. From an average of Atlantic <b>tropical</b> cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996, the first <b>tropical</b> storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July, and a second formed by 8 August.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} <b>tropical</b> {{depressions}} this season {{that did not}} become named storms, only Eleven-E threatened land. An area of disturbed weather associated with a <b>tropical</b> wave formed into a <b>tropical</b> cyclone on September 5. It tracked northwestward, before turning southwest. It weakened into a remnant low on September 8. The remnant turned north and dissipated on September 10 offshore of the Baja California peninsula. The cyclone was nearly a <b>tropical</b> storm when it peaked on September 6. It was forecast to become a <b>tropical</b> storm and pass close to the peninsula. This prompted a <b>tropical</b> storm warning and a hurricane watch. With the weakening of the cyclone the watch and warning were discontinued. No damage or casualties were reported in association with this <b>tropical</b> cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Only six <b>tropical</b> {{cyclones}} {{were observed}} in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1949–2006 average of 13 per year. Of the six <b>tropical</b> cyclones, two only attained hurricane status. In addition, none of the <b>tropical</b> cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began, nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane. However, {{it is likely that}} other <b>tropical</b> cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed, due to lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery. In addition to the six <b>tropical</b> cyclones, another <b>tropical</b> cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin, but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database, rather than the Eastern Pacific. Most of the seven <b>tropical</b> cyclones did not differentiate in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Six. The first two <b>tropical</b> cyclones of the season formed in quick succession in during mid-June, however, the months of July and August went dormant in terms of <b>tropical</b> cyclogenesis. The last five <b>tropical</b> cyclones, including the additional storm, also developed in a quick sequence, all of which forming from in a span of 17 days. By October 1, all <b>tropical</b> cyclonic activity had completely ceased.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} <b>tropical</b> or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered <b>tropical</b> depression, though lack of sufficient characteristics of a <b>tropical</b> depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, {{it would have been}} one of eight <b>tropical</b> cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep <b>tropical</b> Atlantic since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased <b>tropical</b> cyclogenesis from African <b>tropical</b> waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from <b>tropical</b> waves. Of the season's twelve <b>tropical</b> cyclones, only five originated from <b>tropical</b> waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight <b>tropical</b> storms were from <b>tropical</b> waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no <b>tropical</b> storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve <b>tropical</b> depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight <b>tropical</b> storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from <b>tropical</b> waves.|$|E
