25|$|<b>The</b> <b>graph</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> {{value of}} the euro in korunas from 1999 to December 2008. As may be seen, the {{currency}} strengthened as Slovakia's economy did. The koruna joined the ERM II on 28 November 2005 {{at the rate of}} € = 38.4550 Sk with a 15% band. On 17 March 2007, this rate was readjusted to 35.4424 Sk with the same band, an 8.5% increase in the {{value of the}} koruna. On the same day, 1 euro traded at 33.959 Sk. The central rate of koruna was then adjusted once more on 28 May 2008 to 23.8545 with no change in the band.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>graph</b> <b>shows</b> <b>the</b> {{times at}} which unsuppressed {{responses}} to tones occurred when the volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed [...] "tone events" [...] on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but {{a significant decrease in}} tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden {{increase in the number of}} tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to ERP measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.|$|E
