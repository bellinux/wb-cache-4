5|$|In Gilmore's introduction, he lists {{a number}} of novels and films {{supposedly}} influenced by <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible and LaVeyan Satanism. These include the novels Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin and Our Lady of Darkness by Fritz Leiber, as well as films such as Rosemary's Baby, The Devil's Rain, The Car, and Dr. Dracula. Others have lauded <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible as heavily influential on metal and rock bands such as Black Sabbath, Venom, King Diamond, and Marilyn Manson.|$|E
5|$|James Lewis {{argues that}} {{scientific}} themes are so prevalent in <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible because LaVey was {{appealing to the}} authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} {{stories of the}} birth of <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible on his own from monographs he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists {{a number of people who}} influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.|$|E

Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "dismiss Boston's Upper Crust {{as a joke}} rock band if you must, but give them this much: they're actually funny, and there's as much rock as mock to their singular brand of ‘roque’", adding [...] "there's plenty of worthy riffs and double-entendre wit to go around". The group originated from a Boston surf rock band called 'The Clamdiggers'. Other related bands were The Bags, <b>The</b> Titanics, <b>The</b> <b>Satanics,</b> <b>The</b> Flies, The Oysters and Seks Bomba.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible is {{composed}} of four books: The Book of Satan, The Book of Lucifer, The Book of Belial, and The Book of Leviathan. The Book of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The Book of Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The Book of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. The Book of Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces {{are said to be}} manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} groups had any real impact on the {{emergence}} of <b>the</b> later <b>Satanic</b> milieu in <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> Nine <b>Satanic</b> Statements outline <b>the</b> basic {{ideology}} of LaVeyan Satanism, {{and have become}} some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They {{also served as a}} template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 [...] "Nine Satanic Sins". Ayn Rand's influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in <b>the</b> Nine <b>Satanic</b> Statements, leading some, namely Nikolas Schreck, to assert that the Statements are simply unacknowledged paraphrase of Rand's thoughts. These accusations have been disproved, however.|$|R

5|$|LaVey's estranged {{daughter}} Zeena Schreck, in an exposé {{about both}} her father's religion and past, attributes {{the birth of}} <b>The</b> <b>Satanic</b> Bible to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon. According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to draw from {{the popularity of the}} 1968 horror film Rosemary's Baby, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and other occult practices. Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in The Cloven Hoof, a Church of Satan newsletter.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian black metal scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by black metal musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the black metal scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject <b>the</b> <b>Satanic</b> inclination of black metal, writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas black metal during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Viking metal draws {{extensively}} on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation {{of violence and}} virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep <b>the</b> <b>Satanic</b> elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.|$|E

25|$|Anton Szandor LaVey (born Howard Stanton Levey; April 11, 1930 - October 29, 1997) was an American author, {{musician}} and occultist.
