5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from <b>tower</b> <b>cranes,</b> {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{simulation}} tools {{have only}} been used and understood by the academic community. Special Purpose Simulation (SPS) techniques have introduced computer modeling to the industry, resulting in reduced model development time and a user-friendly environment. This paper describes the special purpose simulation template, {{which is based on}} the <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> operations performed by PCL Constructors Inc. On-site management of the <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> resource is based on prioritized work tasks that need to be performed within a set period of time. Traditional SPS modeling techniques use `relationship logic links' to represent the logic contained in the modeled system. As the number of work tasks increases for the <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> resource, the model complexity using traditional simulation techniques becomes unmanageable, resulting in limited acceptance by industry practitioners. The <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> template uses `priority rating logic' to replace the `relationship logic links'. Evaluation of the <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> operations at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Facility (ECERF), being constructed in Edmonton, is used to illustrate the advantages of using the `priority rating logic' modeling approach for <b>tower</b> <b>crane</b> operations.
