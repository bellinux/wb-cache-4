5|$|He {{chooses to}} go {{mountain}} climbing; to his initial annoyance, Hernandez invites herself along. That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his memories and new-found adulation. In return, Archer tries to caution her that space exploration is not as idealistic as she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is. In spite of this, the two manage to rekindle their romance. Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval.

5|$|King Artaxerxes <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> {{just that}} the cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But {{whichever}} of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she pushes {{a woman in}} front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in her head. In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E

The Republican party <b>think</b> <b>it</b> wrong--we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a moral, a social, and a political wrong. We <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong which in its tendency, to say the least, affects the existence of the whole nation. Because we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong.|$|R

Mason told TV Week that he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is a shame Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{move into}} an old house, {{wondering}} at its low cost. Their questions are answered when the walls begin to bleed and objects begin to fly through the air, and Lisa senses an evil presence in the house. There is also a portal to another dimension in the kitchen. Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it, due {{to the cost of}} buying the house. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Marge unlike the others however, is instead using her knife to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting - a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement. After the Spirit of The House threatens them again, Marge loses her patience and confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> over, and eventually opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.|$|E

5|$|According to tradition, {{the city}} was founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists from Megara, led by the eponymous Byzas, around 658 BC. At the time the city {{consisted}} of a small region around an acropolis, located on the easternmost hill (corresponding to the modern site of the TopkapÄ± Palace). According to the late Byzantine Patria of Constantinople, ancient Byzantium was enclosed by a small wall, which began on {{the northern edge of}} the acropolis, extended west to the Tower of Eugenios, then went south and west towards the Strategion and the Baths of Achilles, continued south to the area known in Byzantine times as Chalkoprateia, and then turned, {{in the area of the}} Hagia Sophia, in a loop towards the northeast, crossed the regions known as Topoi and Arcadianae and reached the sea at the later quarter of Mangana. This wall was protected by 27 towers, and had at least two landward gates, one which survived to become known as the Arch of Urbicius, and one where the Milion monument was later located. On the seaward side, the wall was much lower. Although the author of the Patria asserts that this wall dated to the time of Byzas, the French researcher Raymond Janin <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> more likely that it reflects the situation after {{the city was}} rebuilt by the Spartan general Pausanias, who conquered the city in 479 BC. This wall is known to have been repaired, utilising tomb stones, under the leadership of a certain Leo in 340 BC, against an attack by Philip II of Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings a}} {{cockroach}} {{from the hotel}} room to Berenbaum, who <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> may be mechanical. Mulder then visits the nearby Dr. Ivanov, a wheelchair-bound scientist who works on insect-like robots. The two discuss the possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences could send robotic probes to study other planets. After inspecting the Mulder's specimen, Ivanov is rendered speechless; he informs Mulder that the specimen is, technology-wise, vastly superior to anything he's ever seen. Scully arrives in the town at a convenience store, finding the residents succumbing to panic over the roaches. She attempts to calm the people down, however the store-goers frantically flee after two scuffling patrons knock over a display of chocolate candies, believing {{them to be more}} roaches. Meanwhile, Mulder, while departing Ivanov's lab, catches another roach to bring to Berenbaum, but this time, she concludes that it is a seemingly normal cockroach. Scully finds out that Eckerle was researching dung-derived methane as an alternative fuel source, and had been importing animal dung that may have introduced the roaches to the area. Upon hearing this, Mulder speculates that the roaches are actually extraterrestrial robotic probes that are capable of consuming dungâan abundant resource already exploited by some species of roachesâto generate methane as a source of fuel.|$|E

25|$|Babbitt {{wrote a book}} in 2005 titled Cities in the Wilderness: A New Vision of Land Use in America, {{where he}} proposes to amend the Endangered Species Act {{so that it is}} used to identify, conserve, and protect landscapes, watersheds, and {{ecosystems}} whether or not an endangered species exists there. Drawing a parallel with preventive medicine, he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> should promote the protection of open space and ecosystems before the downward spiral to extinction begins.|$|E
