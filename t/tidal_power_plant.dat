40|$|The author {{examines}} {{the nature of}} wave processes {{and their impact on}} the operation of <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> The article also has an overview of both operating and prospective <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in Russia and worldwide. Patterns of tidal fluctuations and the intensity of their driving forces are also considered in the article. The author discloses the origin of tides in terms of elementary physics and hydraulics. The author covers various aspects of formation of different types of inequality of tides caused by alterations in the mutual positions of the Sun and the Moon in relation to the Earth, variable declination of tide-generating luminaries (the Sun and the Moon) in relation to the plane of the Earth equator, and variable distance between the luminaries and the Earth. The author analyzes wave-related phenomena, including refraction, diffraction and interference, their origin and influence onto the properties of waves. The author also covers the origin of advancing and standing waves, or waves of mixed origin, and the impact of the wind onto the characteristics of wave fluctuations. The author provides suggestions regarding potential methods of their control that can affect the essential concept of construction of <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> range <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{represent}} an attractive approach for the large-scale {{generation of electricity}} from the marine environment. Even though the tides and by extension the available energy resource are predictable, they are also variable in time. This variability poses a challenge regarding the optimal transient control of <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> We consider simulation methods which include the main modes of operation of <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> along with algorithms to regulate the timing of these. This paper proposes a framework where simplified <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> operation models are coupled with gradient-based optimisation techniques to determine the optimal control strategy over multiple tidal cycles. The optimisation results inform coastal ocean simulations that include <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> to gauge whether the benefits of an adaptive operation are preserved once their hydrodynamic impacts are also taken into consideration. The combined operation of two prospective tidal lagoon projects within the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary is used as an example to demonstrate {{the potential benefits of}} an energy maximisation optimisation approach. For the case studies considered, the inclusion of pumping and an adaptive operation is shown to deliver an overall increase in energy output of 20 – 40 % compared to a conventional two-way uniform operation. The findings also demonstrate that smaller schemes stand to gain more from operational optimisation compared to designs of a larger scale...|$|R

40|$|Tidal mills {{were the}} main {{industrial}} activity in the Bay of Cadiz for centuries. They were the last step {{in the production of}} salt and flour made by grinding grains. They were installed along the shallow channels, called “caños”, around the Bay, where the frictional and geometrical effects are very strong. The authors have analyzed the propagation of the semidiurnal tidal waves along the Caño de Sancti Petri and the available <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> in the area. The ancient tidal mills were located where the available tidal potential energy is highest, which ensured productivity for grinding salt and wheat in ancient times.

50|$|In {{order for}} <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> to work {{successfully}} {{it requires a}} tide difference of at least 5 m. Unfortunately {{there are only a}} few places where this occurs. This means <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> cannot just be constructed anywhere. There are only a handful of sites on Earth with this type of tidal range. A demonstration project has begun in New York City. In the last four years, the federal commission has approved nearly a dozen permits to study tidal sites. Applications for about 40 others, all filed in 2006, are under review. No one has applied for a development license, Miller said. The site that is furthest along in testing lies in New York’s East River, between the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens, where Verdant Power plans to install two underwater turbines this month as part of a small pilot project.|$|R

40|$|Tide mills {{played an}} {{important}} role in the industrial and port development of Europe, particularly in the West. They were often sited on the coast, but also on estuaries. The technique of tide mill building and utilization was exported to the Atlantic coasts of North America.

They may be justly considered the forerunners of modern <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> A renewed interest in tide mills has been generated by maritime and industrial heritage historians, and praiseworthy efforts at safeguarding and rehabilitation have blossomed, particularly in France and the United Kingdom.

5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to <b>tidal</b> <b>power.</b> Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. <b>Tidal</b> stream <b>power</b> captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> of notable size are the Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively.

In this book, he started by pointing out that humanity would one day run out of coal (he dismissed petroleum as a source of energy, because he felt that it would run out very quickly), and went on to discuss other possible sources of energy that could replace coal, including geothermal power (which already existed in Italy at the time the book was written), and other types of renewable energy that had not yet actually been used: the solar updraft tower, wave farms, and <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{technology}} of useful conversion of wave <b>power</b> and <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> is presented. These two power resources are reviewed separately, but on the same basis: principles of operation, existing devices or plants and research and development. Promising wave power devices in Britain, the United States and Europe are discussed. If wave power is to be competitive, {{one of the first}} requirements may be energy densification. Proposed energy densification schemes include resonance, high pressure water and wave focussing. Wave focussing is a Norwegian invention, technically feasible, and although more research and development is required, it appears to be more promising than alternative forms of wave power utilisation. According to a preliminary cost analysis, it could be competitive with conventional hydro-electric power. The large scale exploitation of <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> has been considered seriously for about half a century; the literature on the topic is voluminous. The main limitations of <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> are its intermittent nature and the high costs involved in the construction of a plant. The existing pilot plants at the Rance and Kislaya Guba have respectively proved that <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> is technically feasible and that construction costs could be reduced. With the rapid increase in the price of fossil fuels, <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> may be realised at the two best sites in the world, the Bay of Fundy and the Severn Estuary...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{feasibility}} {{and sustainable}} operation of tidal lagoons and barrages {{has been under}} scrutiny over uncertainties with regards to their environmental impacts, potential interactions and energy output. A numerical modelling methodology that evaluates their effects on the hydro-environment has been refined to consider technical constraints and specifications associated with variable turbine designs and operational sequences. The method has been employed to assess a number of proposals and their combinations within the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary in the UK. Operational challenges associated with <b>tidal</b> range <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are highlighted, while also presenting the capabilities of modelling tools tailored to their assessment. Results indicate that as the project scale increases so does its relative hydrodynamic impact, which may compromise annual energy output expectations if not accounted for. However, {{the manner in which}} such projects are operated can also {{have a significant impact on}} changing the local hydro-environment, including the ecology and morphology. Therefore, it is imperative that <b>tidal</b> range <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are designed in such a way that efficiently taps into renewable energy sources, with minimal interference to the regional hydro-environment through their operation...|$|R
