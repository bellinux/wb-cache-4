40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} efficient forward error correction on differentially encoded, quadriphase-shift-keying (DQPSK) channels. The approach is to design codes to correct the most probable error patterns. First the probability distribution of error patterns is derived. Then a class of convolutional codes <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> any single two-bit error is described. Finally a threshold decodable code <b>that</b> <b>corrects</b> all single, and many double, two-bit errors is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design {{ophthalmic}} lenses <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> peripheral refractive errors of human eyes along a meridian. We designed lenses with the tangential section of one surface based on a figured spheroid but figured in the tangential section only. The curvature of the sagittal section of this surface was adjusted separately. A merit function was used to modify these surfaces until the lenses had power errors <b>that</b> <b>corrected</b> the eye. Examples are presented of lenses <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> a schematic eye. They do excellent jobs of correcting the peripheral power errors of the eye and are relatively insensitive to small changes in fitting distance. We conclude that it is theoretically feasible to design lenses to correct peripheral refractive errors...|$|R
