Ramachandran), {{a wealthy}} {{industrialist}} who goes on vacation to his bungalow in Shimla, {{only to discover}} that his caretaker (Sambandam) and his wife have left for Varanasi after renting <b>the</b> <b>bungalow</b> to a family of three. The rest of the film revolves around JB's response to this situation.|$|E
5|$|Goldfrapp {{signed a}} {{recording}} contract with London-based record label Mute Records in August 1999. The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, {{in a rented}} bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The recording process was difficult for Alison Goldfrapp, who was often alone and disturbed by the mice and insects in <b>the</b> <b>bungalow.</b> Gregory described their recording sessions as intense because he was unaccustomed to composing with others. Goldfrapp contributed the album's lyrics, and Gregory and Goldfrapp composed the music together. The lyrics are abstract obsessional tales inspired by films, Goldfrapp's childhood, and the loneliness she felt while recording the album. Musically, the album takes influence {{from a variety of}} styles including 1960s pop, cabaret, folk, and electronica.|$|E
25|$|Bungalow Features {{normally}} {{took place}} outside <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow,</b> and were shown in short film segments during the show. They were mostly for entertainment purposes {{and had no}} bearing on the points totals of <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow</b> Heads.|$|E

60|$|While Mr. Appleby was {{negotiating}} with Mrs. Wadsworth and Mrs. Basswood for the loan of several pieces of rustic furniture which <b>the</b> <b>bungalows</b> contained, Della Ford and her aunt visited with the boys. The young actress {{wanted to know}} all about what the young folks at <b>the</b> <b>bungalows</b> had been doing, and expressed her delight at the cosiness of the place, and its beautiful surroundings.|$|R

25|$|Several {{games were}} played live in <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow</b> in each episode. These were mostly contested by <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow</b> Heads for points, {{although}} there were some exceptions. In accordance with UK children's television tradition, many of the games involved the participants being gunged. This was particularly true of {{the final game of}} every show, called Creamy Muck Muck.|$|E

25|$|Inside <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow</b> {{was a large}} purple cupboard, {{and once}} or twice during each show, away from the {{attention}} of Dick, Dom and <b>the</b> <b>Bungalow</b> Heads, the cupboard doors would open to show the adventures of Diddy Dick and Dom. These were short pre-recorded sketches, {{no more than a}} minute in length, with Dick and Dom donning black clothes and attaching a small puppet's body around their necks. Both Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom spoke with very squeaky voices, edited in post production.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{exterior}} {{view of a}} California <b>bungalow</b> court with <b>the</b> San Gabriel Mountains in the background, Pasadena, ca. 1916. <b>The</b> <b>bungalows,</b> consisted of mostly single-story houses, form a rectangle around the courtyard (center). A driveway leads from the street, past the stone-masonry walls that encloses the community, and into the courtyard. Small (young?) trees decorate the yards of <b>the</b> <b>bungalows.</b> Larger trees are visible {{in the background and}} foreground...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> classic over-the-water <b>bungalows</b> {{were added}} to the hotel in 1970, nine years after its {{original}} construction. Architect Paul Hammarberg designed <b>the</b> <b>bungalows</b> for Hotel Bora Bora. These were <b>the</b> first over-the-water <b>bungalows</b> in Bora Bora, and created a precedent for future developers. <b>The</b> <b>bungalows</b> on <b>the</b> water provide resort guests with a 270-degree view of the surrounding islands of Tahaa, Raiatea, Maupiti, Mootu, and Toopua, as well as a view of the barrier reef. The design of the hotel is based on the traditional Tahitian style. The 65 luxury rooms and 15 over-the-water bungalows are built on stilts in the water, facing the Bora Bora Lagoon.|$|R

25|$|Kipling's birth home on {{the campus}} of the J J School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the Dean's residence. Although the cottage bears a plaque noting it as the site where Kipling was born, the {{original}} cottage may have been torn down decades ago and a new one built in its place. Some historians and conservationists are also of the view that <b>the</b> <b>bungalow</b> marks a site that is merely close to the home of Kipling's birth, as <b>the</b> <b>bungalow</b> was built in 1882—about 15 years after Kipling was born. In fact, Kipling seems to have said as much to the Dean when he visited J J School in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|The {{family home}} had been {{demolished}} in 1943, {{and many of}} the bricks delivered to Pickford in California.
