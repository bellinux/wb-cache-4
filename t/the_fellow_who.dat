25|$|After the {{takeover}} of the journal by the Royal Society, management decisions including negotiating with printers and booksellers, were still the task {{of one of the}} Secretaries—but editorial control was exercised through the Committee of Papers. The Committee mostly based its judgements on which papers to publish and which to decline on the 300 to 500-word abstracts of papers read during its weekly meetings. But the members could, if they desired, consult the original paper in full. Once the decision to print had been taken, the paper appeared in the volume for that year. It would feature the author's name, the name of <b>the</b> <b>Fellow</b> <b>who</b> had communicated the paper to the Society, and the date on which it was read. The Royal Society covered paper, engraving and printing costs. The Society found the journal to be a money-losing proposition: it cost, on average, upwards of £300 annually to produce, of which they seldom recouped more than £150. Because two-fifths of the copies were distributed for free to the journal's natural market, sales were generally slow, and although back issues sold out gradually it would usually be ten years or more before there were fewer than 100 left of any given print run.|$|E
500|$|Despite Maulbetsch's efforts, Michigan {{was never}} able to punch the ball across the goal line. [...] Many blamed Michigan's quarterback who {{switched}} to another back every time after Maulbetsch [...] "took the ball to the shadow of the Crimson goal posts." [...] In answer to the question why Michigan was unable to score, Frank Menke said: [...] "Ask <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> quarterbacked for Michigan that day. [...] His actions were too mystifying for the spectators to figure out." ...|$|E
500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> gets the opportunity it's <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> puts his hands around it and grabs it. I just {{happened to be in the}} right place at the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E

Certainly, {{so far as the}} two forces have come into conflict here, there has been no disposition, on either side, to 'make war with the water of roses.' It's astonishing, in fact, to see how ruthless <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> have just got up are toward <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> are still down. And the best of us have been up only a generation or two--and <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> are still down know it." ...|$|R

500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jack Harold Paar (May 1, 1918 – January 27, 2004) was an American author, {{radio and}} {{television}} comedian and talk show host, {{best known for his}} stint as host of The Tonight Show from 1957 to 1962. Time magazine's obituary of him noted that: [...] "His fans would remember him as <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> split talk show history into two eras: Before Paar and Below Paar." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, Cruikshank {{was hired}} as the pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Steubenville, Ohio, {{approximately}} 40 miles west of Pittsburgh. [...] He remained in Steubenville through at least 1926. [...] While working as a minister, Cruikshank continued his interest in football and {{used it as a}} theme in his speeches and sermons. [...] At a 1923 banquet honoring Steubenville's undefeated 1922 football team, Cruikshank spoke of the importance athletics:"I am for athletics in the school. [...] They create a school consciousness, call it spirit if you will. When you leave school after playing on its football team you have something that will always hold your school career near and dear to you. ... Athletics embue <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> plays and the fans as well in a spirit that never says die. ... That's the thing that counts in life, the never give up spirit. [...] To my mind if we can take this spirit out of high school with us it means more to us than our Latin or Greek. [...] In my work especially I find that every walk of life needs <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> can take the kick and still come up with a smile but a determination." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Haven't {{seen him}} this morning. Father Agustin {{believes}} he'll respect the wish of the majority, although <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> did <b>the</b> fighting {{are all on}} his side." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sanchez {{recently}} {{stated that}} with the Coheed and Cambria saga completely chronicled on the group's first five albums, he has been contemplating the direction of future releases. [...] "I've thought of telling stories {{of the future and}} stories of the past, maybe getting involved more in the story of Sirius Amory (sic – Sirius Amory in the stories), <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> figured out the value of the Keywork," [...] he said. [...] "Or even stories that kind of parallel the one that we’re telling. It’s kind of up in the air. I’ve started writing music for that next record, and I'm kind of hoping that maybe in doing that it's going to tell me which one to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, {{the circus}} made Frank Buck a lucrative offer to tour as their star {{attraction}} and {{to enter the}} show astride an elephant. He refused to join the American Federation of Actors, stating that he was [...] "a scientist, not an actor." [...] Though there was a threat of a strike {{if he did not}} join the union, he maintained that he would not compromise his principles, saying, [...] "Don't get me wrong. I'm with the working man. I worked like a dog once myself. And my heart is with <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> works. But I don't want some... union delegate telling me when to get on and off an elephant." [...] Eventually, the union gave Buck a special dispensation to introduce Gargantua the gorilla without registering as an actor.|$|E
2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. I did some roping and riding, and Jack, {{who was one of}} the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great interest in me. It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off. It's <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{this kind}} of thing happens often, <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> hold my notes will get a painful shock," [...] he thought, with a wry smile, and closed his eyes.|$|R

6000|$|... "With a gang like ours, {{one must}} prove one's {{claim to be}} boss at the start.

60|$|In vain <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> {{held him}} {{tried to stop}} his cries. They grew louder, and soon {{footsteps}} were heard approaching.|$|E
60|$|He {{read the}} {{magazines}} about himself, and pored over portraits of himself published therein {{until he was}} unable to associate his identity with those portraits. He was <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> had lived and thrilled and loved; who had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life; who had served in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led his gang in the old fighting days. He was <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> had been stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library, and who had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them; he was <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and written books himself. But the one thing he was not was that colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't {{much fun}} in it," [...] said Dan, soberly. [...] "It was real hard {{fighting}} {{from start to}} finish. <b>The</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> went in for a mere dust-up got left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you all about it afterward, Chebron. There is no time for talking now, his orders must be {{instantly}} carried out. Where are <b>the</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>who</b> are spying over you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Either that, or else <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> {{did the job}} made a dozen trips or more. To me, the {{footprints}} look very much alike." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who's</b> responsible," [...] {{answered}} {{the boy who}} had fallen, and he strode up to confront Fred. [...] "For two pins I'd smash you on the nose," [...] he continued, hotly.|$|R

60|$|Andrew Felps was {{followed}} by Lush Barrock. When <b>the</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> had robbed the sawmill saw Snap and his chums he was almost struck dumb.|$|E
