2500|$|Throatlatch (also, <b>throttle,</b> throatlash, <b>throat</b> [...] ): {{the point}} at which the {{windpipe}} meets the head at the underside of the jaw, corresponding to where the eponymous part of a bridle goes.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} have your will," [...] the wheat-farmer conceded sardonically, {{although}} his big hand clenched involuntarily as if <b>throttling</b> a <b>throat.</b> [...] "Besides, if we should run short of food you will prove desirable--for the quantity of you, I mean, and not otherwise. Now just who would you consider undesirable?--the black nigger? He ain't got a gun." ...|$|R
60|$|Breakfast was an {{excitement}} {{shared in}} peculiarly by the Ancient Mariner and Dag Daughtry, while {{the trio of}} partners raged and bewailed. Captain Doane particularly wailed. Simon Nishikanta was fiendish in his descriptions of whatever miscreant had done the deed and of how he {{should be made to}} suffer for it, while Grimshaw clenched and repeatedly clenched his great hands as if <b>throttling</b> some <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|And as Rabba Kega turned, a lithe figure shot outward and {{downward}} {{from the}} tree above upon his broad shoulders. The impact of the springing creature carried Rabba Kega to the ground. He felt strong jaws close upon his neck, and {{when he tried to}} scream, steel fingers <b>throttled</b> his <b>throat.</b> The powerful black warrior struggled to free himself; but he was as a child in the grip of his adversary.|$|R
60|$|Almost swifter than Bostil's sight was {{the action}} of Slone--flashing by--in the air--himself on the {{plunging}} horse. Sears shot once, twice. Then Wildfire bolted as his rider whipped the lasso round the horn. Sears, half rising, was jerked ten feet. An awful shriek was <b>throttled</b> in his <b>throat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a gloryus game yer runnin', Kid,' cried Lon McFane. 'All the {{percentage}} of the house an' niver a bit to the man that's buckin'. The Devil himself'd niver tackle such a cinch--and damned if I do.' There were chuckles, <b>throttled</b> in gurgling <b>throats,</b> and winks brushed away with the frost which rimed the eyelashes, as the men climbed the ice-notched bank and started {{across the street to the}} Post. But the long howl had drawn nearer, invested with a new note of menace. A woman screamed round the corner. There was a cry of, 'Here he comes!' Then an Indian boy, at the head of half a dozen frightened dogs, racing with death, dashed into the crowd. And behind came Yellow Fang, a bristle of hair and a flash of gray. Everybody but the Yankee fled.|$|R
60|$|But {{instead of}} the door frame his head and {{shoulders}} {{came in contact with}} the warm flesh of a pair of living legs. The exclamation of surprise that almost burst from his lips was <b>throttled</b> in his <b>throat</b> by steel-thewed fingers that closed about his windpipe with the suddenness of thought. The black struggled to arise--to turn upon the creature that had seized him--to wriggle from its hold; but all to no purpose. As he had been held in a mighty vise of iron he could not move. He could not scream. Those awful fingers at his throat but closed more and more tightly. His eyes bulged from their sockets. His face turned an ashy blue. Presently he relaxed once more--this time in the final dissolution from which there is no quickening. Korak propped the dead body against the door frame. There it sat, lifelike in the gloom. Then the ape-man turned and glided into the Stygian darkness of the hut's interior.|$|R
60|$|With {{magnificent}} bound Stewart {{was upon}} him. The guerrilla's cry was <b>throttled</b> in his <b>throat.</b> A fierce wrestling ensued, too swift to see clearly; then heavy, sodden blows, and Don Carlos was beaten to the ground. Stewart leaped back. Then, crouching {{with his hands}} on the butts of guns at his hips, he yelled, he thundered at the guerrillas. He had been quicker than a panther, and now his voice was so terrible that it curdled Madeline's blood, and the menace of deadly violence in his crouching position made her shut her eyes. But she had to open them. In that single instant Nels and Monty had leaped to Stewart's side. Both were bent down, with hands on the butts of guns at their hips. Nels's piercing yell seemed to divide Monty's roar of rage. Then they ceased, and echoes clapped from the crags. The silence of those three men crouching like tigers about to leap was more menacing than the nerve-racking yells.|$|R
40|$|Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs) {{are capable}} of on-command {{variable}} thrust or thrust modulation, an operability advantage that has been studied intermittently since the late 1930 s. Throttleable LREs {{can be used for}} planetary entry and descent, space rendezvous, orbital maneuvering including orientation and stabilization in space, and hovering and hazard avoidance during planetary landing. Other applications have included control of aircraft rocket engines, limiting of vehicle acceleration or velocity using retrograde rockets, and ballistic missile defense trajectory control. Throttleable LREs can also continuously follow the most economical thrust curve in a given situation, compared to discrete throttling changes over a few select operating points. The effects of variable thrust on the mechanics and dynamics of an LRE as well as difficulties and issues surrounding the throttling process are important aspects of throttling behavior. This review provides a detailed survey of LRE throttling centered around engines from the United States. Several LRE throttling methods are discussed, including high-pressure-drop systems, dual-injector manifolds, gas injection, multiple chambers, pulse modulation, <b>throat</b> <b>throttling,</b> movable injector components, and hydrodynamically dissipative injectors. Concerns and issues surrounding each method are examined, and the advantages and shortcomings compared...|$|R
