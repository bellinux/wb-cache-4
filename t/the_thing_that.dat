5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them that only <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> killed Abbott {{and the others}} is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E

25|$|While {{working for}} the WWF, Peterson filmed several hours of behind-the-scenes footage with a video camera which he often carried. He often claimed that he would release a {{documentary}} called <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>that</b> Should Not Be or The Real Maxx Payne based on the footage, but never did. The footage reportedly contained scenes showing substance abuse and solicitation.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us with {{the meaning of a}} word. For Wittgenstein, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the word stands for does not give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
500|$|I didn't want to {{make the}} movie 3D because when you have things that big… <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happens naturally, you're looking at two {{buildings}} lets say at 300 feet , if you move there is no parallax. They're so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move… To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their [...] miniaturized, making them human scale.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{this is not}} <b>the</b> only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> self {{wishes to}} do. According to Singh, having created time, the self wishes to {{dominate}} it—it wishes to [...] "dominate it and rule over it, to be its master." [...] This latter wish of the self comes from its self-image, that is, from the way it perceives itself. [...] "But how does the self perceive itself? What is its vision of itself? What is its dream?":Its dream is to dominate—to rule over—not only <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can see but also <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can think about, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can imagine and not yet imagine, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can conceive, invent, conjure up, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can concoct—images, ideas, concepts and words, representations, notions, but not only these. The dream of the self is to master <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> it can create.And time is a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> it has created.|$|R

Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> bothers me is that he's faster than all of them."

500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath.

My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made Stella Darlas the greatest, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made this episode work." ...|$|E
500|$|Blast Magazine {{columnist}} Christopher Peck {{was disappointed}} that the writers had not yet revealed {{the reason for the}} Evil Queen's grudge, commenting, [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> sticks out most about an episode of television is what I didn’t get out, that’s an ominous sign: a foreshadowing that the show has no goddamn clue where it’s headed." [...] He did however enjoy seeing Graham's memories, calling them and the other series flashbacks [...] "the freshest and most thrilling part of the show." [...] While describing Graham's death as [...] "heartbreaking," [...] Peck felt that it [...] "completely nullifies any advancement the episode made." [...] He graded the episode with a C+.|$|E

500|$|In Russell's model, {{power over}} the creeds and habits of persons is easy to miscalculate. He claims that, on the one hand, the {{economic}} determinists had underestimated the power of opinion. However, on the other hand, {{he argues that the}} case is easy to make that all power is power over opinion: for [...] "Armies are useless unless the soldiers believe in the cause for which they are fighting... Law is impotent unless it is generally respected."

500|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine realises that Guybrush is {{her true}} love, and marries him. However, Ron Gilbert {{did not intend}} for the {{relationship}} between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine [...] "never really liked Guybrush and thought of him as more of a little brother". Gilbert was not involved in the production of The Curse of Monkey Island; while thinking that the new development team [...] "did {{a pretty good job of}} capturing [...] what Monkey Island was about", the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> bugged [...] the most about The Curse of Monkey Island".|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, while {{brainstorming}} ideas for a program for the PDP-1, Russell had just finished reading the Lensman series by E. E. [...] "Doc" [...] Smith and thought the stories {{would make a good}} basis for the program. [...] "His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued. That sort of action was <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> suggested Spacewar. He had some very glowing descriptions of spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers." [...] Other influences cited by fellow programmer Martin Graetz include E.E. Smith's Skylark novels and Japanese pulp fiction tokusatsu movies.|$|E
