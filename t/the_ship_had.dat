5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> three smoke stacks {{amidships}} for its boilers, but {{the forward}} stack was non-functioning; only added for aesthetic purposes. The ship began service with the Hudson River Day Line as their flagship steamer from 1913 to 1926.|$|E

5|$|A {{contract}} {{to build the}} ship that would become Agincourt was signed on 3June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14September 1911. The design called for a staggering fourteen 12-inch guns, something historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing {{the total number of}} guns.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|After the {{beginning}} of the Battle of France on 10 May, the 2nd DCT was transferred to the English Channel to support British forces there. On 23 May, entering Dunkirk harbor with a demolition team aboard, Jaguar was struck by a torpedo fired by either the E-boat S-21 or S-23. The detonation killed 13 men and wounded 23; <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> to be beached at Malo-les-Bains lest she sink, and was written off.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|At Mare Island, Comfort had her boilers {{replaced}} and {{the electrical}} system was revamped, which entailed replacing all temporary wiring with permanent wiring and watertight fixtures. The crew quarters of <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> also become infested with bedbugs from older German-style hospital bedding and remedies and eradication were performed. But Comfort {{had seen the}} end of her Navy service; she was decommissioned 5 August 1921, and was sold at Mare Island 1 April 1925.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1916, Prinz Heinrich {{was removed}} from front-line service and used as a {{floating}} office in Kiel.

She was stricken from the navy list on 25 January 1920 and sold later that year. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap at Audorf-Rendsburg.|$|E
5|$|By October 1938, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> been renamed Pan Gulf {{to reflect}} the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston during this time.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> been {{sufficiently}} repaired {{to begin}} the conversion process, but Hitler, angered {{by the failure of}} German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work. Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> fired thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds.

5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} on 1 October 1914, Markgraf conducted sea trials, {{which lasted}} until 12 December. By 10 January 1915, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> joined IIIBattle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet with her three sister ships. On 22 January 1915, IIISquadron was {{detached from the}} fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic.

5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out.

Exacerbating the problem, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
