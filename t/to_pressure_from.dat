5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored {{the custom of}} playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{and private}} {{enterprises}} have also come {{under pressure from}} China to censor media organizations operated by Falun Gong practitioners. In 2008, for instance, French satellite provider Eutelsat suspended its Asian broadcasts of New Tang Dynasty Television in response <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. The move {{was viewed as a}} quid pro quo attempt to secure access to the Chinese market.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000 Fosters Resources, a Canadian company, {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with the government of Sudan to develop the concession that covered most of the Melut Basin, including the Adar Yeil field, in partnership with a consortium of Arab and Sudanese companies.

5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> the Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and forced them to migrate west as well.|$|E

5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban macaw {{was traded}} and hunted by Amerindians, and by Europeans after their {{arrival in the}} 15th century. Many {{individuals}} were brought to Europe as cagebirds, and 19 museum skins exist today. It had become rare by the mid-19th century due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> hunting, trade, and habitat destruction. Hurricanes may also have contributed to its demise. The last reliable accounts of the species are from the 1850s on Cuba and 1864 on Isla de la Juventud, but it may have persisted until 1885.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions.

5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison.

5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities in Turkish (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries in Turkish Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E
5|$|After {{his work}} at the UN, Soedjatmoko {{attempted}} to study at Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, he was forced to resign due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected {{as a member of the}} Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Casimir's son Bolesław II the Bold, {{also known}} as the Generous (r. 1058–1079), {{developed}} Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077. As an active supporter of the pope in its Investiture Controversy with the German emperor, Bolesław crowned himself king in 1076 with the blessing of Pope Gregory VII. In 1079, there was an anti-Bolesław conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Kraków. Bolesław had Bishop Stanisław of Szczepanów executed; subsequently Bolesław was forced to abdicate the Polish throne due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. Stanisław would become the second martyr and patron saint of Poland (known in English as St. Stanislav), canonized in 1253.|$|E
5|$|He {{was named}} {{manager of the}} team in 1905, but did not receive {{additional}} pay; he was, however, offered a bonus if the team didn't lose money. In 1905, Tenney tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted his offer due <b>to</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>from</b> MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. For the second straight year, the Boston team lost more than 100 games.|$|E
