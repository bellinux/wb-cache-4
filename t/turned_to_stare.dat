60|$|The Industrialist stared, {{looked at}} the Astronomer, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> again.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} in tweeds <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> down at him, surprised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Burrows was cremated on Wednesday. It seems she {{preferred}} it to burial." [...] Having said this, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> {{from the window}} again.|$|E
60|$|It was Perkins' <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare,</b> {{which he}} did for a moment blankly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was now the}} skipper’s <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare,</b> {{and he did it}} admirably.|$|R
60|$|It was Mrs. Constable's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare.</b> The head she {{suddenly}} and impulsively put forth trembled on Alison's wrist.|$|R
60|$|Digger the Badger stopped {{watching}} his shadow, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Peter. Then he laughed until finally he choked. Peter {{looked at him}} in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Randy Portney!" [...] {{came from}} the lips of the boy addressed, as he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at {{the person who had}} called out his name. [...] "And Earl, too! Where--where did you come from?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{adjutant}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him. Tremayne {{was sitting}} with his head resting on one hand, the fingers thrusting through the crisp fair hair, and there was gloom in his clear-cut face, a dullness in the usually keen grey eyes.|$|E
60|$|It was my <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> dumbly before I {{could manage}} to ask: “For Tolosa?” {{in a very}} knowing tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{that the}} little Northman?" [...] said Carloman, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Richard {{with a look of}} curiosity, while Richard in his turn felt {{considerably}} affronted that a boy so much less than himself should call him little.|$|R
60|$|Then it was Shefford's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare.</b> The Mormon was haggard, grieved, frightened, {{and utterly}} amazed. He {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} make certain of Shefford's being there in the flesh and then to find reason for it.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Caryll {{flashed a}} sidelong glance at Rotherby, who had <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at his father, {{and in his}} heart he cursed the stupidity of my Lord Ostermore. If this {{proposed}} {{to be a member}} of a conspiracy, Heaven help that same conspiracy! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} back to her, then, and began {{clipping}} away as before. Beth sprang up and laid a hand upon his arm, arresting him. Again he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at her, and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.|$|E
60|$|As the Scarecrow came {{in sight}} of the party of travelers, he reined in his wooden steed and dismounted, {{greeting}} the Shaggy Man with a smiling nod. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the Patchwork Girl in wonder, while she in turn stared at him.|$|E
6000|$|It was Acton's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare.</b> He {{instantly}} {{thought of}} his sister; but he said nothing about her. He began to laugh. [...] "I don't wonder at his passion! But I wonder at his forsaking your society for that of your brother's paint-brushes." ...|$|R
60|$|It was the Professor's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare.</b> He had {{not heard}} {{anything}} of Sunday's transactions. He had been hoping against hope that the Arlington affair would remain a locked secret {{between himself and the}} twins, and had done his best to think about everything else.|$|R
40|$|Dramatic Meeting [...] As the {{returned}} Japs chatted gayly at Union Station, {{a group of}} Marines (who had seen action tin the Pacific theater) filed past. Above photo was taken as veterans of the Second Marine Division left their trains at the station. Notice Marine in center who <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the Nips. " [...] caption on photograph...|$|R
60|$|The twins of Twi {{were too}} startled and amazed {{to offer to}} fight with the odd people {{surrounding}} them. Even the executioners allowed their axes to fall harmlessly to the ground, and the double people, soldiers and citizens alike, <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the strangers in wonder.|$|E
60|$|The man <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him; {{he looked}} his {{questioner}} {{up and down}} with such insolence that the boy's fists involuntarily doubled; then he turned his back and walked away. A bystander laughed with amusement. He also was an Englishman, but wore the uniform of a subaltern.|$|E
60|$|Madame <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him, {{surprise}} ineffable in her glance--not at {{the thing}} that he suggested, but at the abruptness with which the suggestion came. The cynical, sneering tone rang in her ears after the words were spoken, and she looked in his face for a confirmation of their full purport.|$|E
60|$|The first milking {{lesson was}} a droll one; but after several scares and many vain attempts, Rose at last managed to fill her cup, while Ben held Clover's tail {{so that it}} could not flap, and Dr. Alec kept her from <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the new milkmaid, who objected to both these {{proceedings}} very much.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was my <b>turn</b> now <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> with {{surprise}} and curiosity. He hadn't been talking loud but {{he lowered his}} voice still more.|$|R
60|$|My cousin {{coughed and}} <b>turned</b> about <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> hard {{out of the}} window. He was, he perceived, much more shockingly {{inadequate}} even than he had expected to be.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} that the Westley-Richards was drawn from its case and loaded, only one buck remained, for, having caught sight of the waggon, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at it suspiciously. Mr. Clifford aimed and fired. Down went the buck, then {{springing}} to its feet again, vanished behind the ridge. Mr. Clifford shook his head sadly.|$|E
60|$|This scornful {{ejaculation}} {{came from}} a little bald-headed man seated in the opposite corner, who had been calmly smoking his pipe and dreamily eyeing the flickering gas-log in the grate. The major gave a start and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> fixedly at the little man. Patsy, scenting mischief, indulged in a little laugh as she threaded her needle.|$|E
6000|$|He {{slipped his}} arm through mine, {{and led me}} into the leading hotel, where, as it was drawing near {{the time for the}} six o'clock supper, every man <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at us as we passed through the crowded bar and vestibule. I was making for the general dining-room when Dixon said: [...] "Go {{straight}} ahead. It was not easy to manage, but our hosts were determined to do the thing in style." ...|$|E
5|$|After Jack Bauer {{fails to}} obtain a {{confession}} from Logan, she screams in public {{that he is a}} murderer during Palmer's funeral. Afterwards, President Logan hits her, and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life. During his tirade, Logan acknowledges all of his misdeeds, unaware that there is a small listening device on his pen. The confession quickly reaches the Attorney General, who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan. As Charles is escorted away by agents, he <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Martha, who smiles at him in triumph.|$|R
50|$|E {{moves back}} to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez. and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple {{look at each other}} and the man “opens his mouth to vituperate” but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> {{directly}} at E as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can’t bear to look at what they’ve seen and turn their faces away.|$|R

60|$|At {{the sound}} of that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice it looked for a few minutes as if school would be broken up for that day. There was the same mad {{scrambling}} to get away that there had been the morning Reddy Fox unexpectedly appeared. However, there was this difference: When Reddy appeared, most of the little people sought safe hiding places, but now they merely ran to safe distances, and there <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> with awe and great respect at the owner of that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice. It was great, big Buster Bear himself.|$|E
60|$|I nodded, then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Higgs, who {{was just}} waking up, for, indeed, he was a sight to see. His fiery red hair was full of sand, his nether {{garments}} were gone, apparently at some stage in our march he had dispensed with the remains of them because they chafed his sore limbs, and his fair skin, not excluding that of his face, was a mass of blisters, raised by the sun. In fact he was so disfigured that his worst enemy would not have known him. He yawned, stretched himself, always a good sign in man or beast, {{and asked for a}} bath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{travelled}} fourteen {{miles in}} a barrel," [...] he said, [...] "and {{we were out}} for twenty-four hours in a Danish sailing skiff. You know what the weather's been like in the North Sea. Before that, the last word of writing I saw on German soil was a placard, offering a reward of five thousand marks for my detention, with a disgustingly lifelike photograph at the top. I had about fifty yards of quay to walk in broad daylight, and every other man I passed <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> after me. It gives you the cold shivers down your back when you daren't look round to see if you're being followed." ...|$|E
60|$|He did not answer. He seemed <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> stone. He <b>stared</b> with ghastly eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, Alice and Adam see {{one another}} again {{on either side}} of an {{escalator}} - she's going down and he's riding up. They both watch each other as they pass without saying anything. Adam stops at the top and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> back at Alice before walking away. The film ends with Alice's voiceover recalling the events in posterity and wondering what might have happened had fate not led her to Adam one morning. She wonders if the passion between them could ever have lasted, and if a [...] "flatlander" [...] like her could ever have stayed at such a high altitude [...] At least that's what she tells herself anyway.|$|R
60|$|There came {{a passage}} in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung {{so that he could}} see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon, but no more of them. Then vague {{impressions}} of galleries and of casual astonished passers-by <b>turning</b> round <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> after the two of them with their red-clad guard.|$|R
