5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E

25|$|The Munsee and Mahican {{tribes of}} Native Americans {{indigenous}} to the Hudson Valley {{did not live}} in the mountains, but settled heavily in the valley below. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the Escarpment only to hunt or start fires to nurture hunting grounds and provide defensive barriers against other tribes, or to follow trails to other communities {{on the far side}} of the mountains. While nothing has been recorded from the early years of contact with European settlers of what role the mountains above them played in their religious beliefs, it is very likely that they did, given their animistic traditions.|$|E
25|$|Bigelow {{was in a}} quandary. His {{troops and}} others were {{receiving}} fire from the San Juan Heights that was fortified by the Spanish defenders. Other units went into position {{on the left and}} the right. But still no orders to advance came. Bigelow's second in command, First Lieutenant Jules Garesche Ord, son of , was sent to Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins asking permission to attack. Hawkins refused to give permission but did not deny it either. En route back to the company, Ord passed by the different units including Roosevelt's Rough Riders and asked them to support the regulars when <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the hill.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans scored first after Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer's fumble {{on a bad}} snap led to Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert's 10-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Eric Martin. Then, Kramer was sacked and the Vikings had to punt, but Saints returner Mel Gray accidentally hit the ball while trying to avoid it and the Vikings recovered on the New Orleans 27, leading to Chuck Nelson's 42-yard field goal. Kramer {{had to leave the}} game on the next drive with a pinched nerve in his neck, but the team would go on to win easily without him. Later in the quarter, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> 10-7 when Anthony Carter returned a Saints punt a playoff record 84 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The one-day losses continued, as the Bears fell to Somerset in the National League on {{the first}} Sunday in September, but they {{recovered}} with a Championship draw and a League win over Surrey. The latter left them with an outside chance of League promotion, trailing Derbyshire in third place by four points but with two games in hand, but <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> into third place with a win in Scotland, and got a four-point lead and a vastly superior net run rate to the fourth-place with a 102-run win over Yorkshire. Their Championship season ended in fourth place after a 181-run win over Gloucestershire, and despite losing their last National League match of the season to Durham Dynamos, Warwickshire were promoted, and will play in Division One of both the Championship and League in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{first round}} of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets, a team led by Keith Van Horn, Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more {{challenging}} with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1–1. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> against the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls. The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced {{between the}} Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a {{challenge}} for promotion to the First Division {{despite the efforts of}} successive managers to put the club back on track, and fell back into the Third Division in 1979. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> as runners up in the Third Division in 1980 and have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. A second successive promotion was nearly achieved the following year, but the club missed out on goal difference, and promotion-winning manager Howard Kendall moved to Everton that summer. Kendall's successor, Bobby Saxton only managed mid-table finishes for the next three seasons, then nearly achieved promotion in the 1984–85 season, but a poor finish the following year (just one place above relegation) followed by an abysmal start to the 1986–87 season cost Saxton his job.|$|E

25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the match, the Spanish team changed into their red shirted home kit for the presentation. These shirts already had a star over the emblem, signifying Spain's World Cup victory. Spain had become the third side to win a World Cup final while playing in their away kit, which was black. (Brazil in 1958 and England in 1966 were earlier winners who played in their away kit.) The Spanish formed a guard of honor for the defeated Dutch as <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to receive their runner-up medals. Afterwards, the now red-shirted Spaniards went up to receive their medals, led by Xavi. Spain captain Iker Casillas (who per tradition went last) was presented with the trophy by South African President Jacob Zuma and FIFA boss Sepp Blatter; Spain were the latest new World Champions since France's win in 1998, and La Roja also became the first new winners since Brazil in 1958 to win outside their home country and also the first European team to win outside their own continent.|$|E

On May 8, he scored 30 points in Game 4 to help the Warriors sweep their second-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz and advance to the Western Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs on May 14, Curry scored 40 points and hit a tying 3-pointer with 1:48 {{remaining}} to help the Warriors rally from a 25-point deficit to win 113–111; the Warriors overcame their largest halftime deficit ever in the postseason at 20 points. In a 120–108 Game 3 win, Curry scored 21 points and became the franchise leader in postseason points, passing Rick Barry. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> 3–0 in the series, becoming the third team in NBA history to win their first 11 playoff games. His 36 points in Game 4 led to a 129–115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third straight year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12–0. In Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Curry recorded his first career postseason triple-double with 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to help the Warriors go up 2–0 in the series with a 132–113 win. Curry helped the Warriors clinch the series and the championship in Game 5 with 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, as Golden State claimed its second title in three years.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 1692, again {{crossed the}} Rhine river under the general command of Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges, and {{advanced}} toward Durlach and Pforzheim. On 24 September, 2,000 cavalry soldiers and 1,200 infantry and artillery troops {{under the command}} of Marshal Noël Bouton de Chamilly, moved to Pforzheim, where the town and 600 soldiers of the imperial German army in town surrendered without any military engagements. The rest of the French army arrived on 27 September {{under the command of}} Marshal de Lorges. On the same day, the French army moved on to Oetisheim near Mühlacker and attacked an imperial army unit of 4,000 cavalry men under the command of Duke Frederick Charles of Württemberg-Winnental in their camp. As they were taken by surprise, they withdrew hastily and lost several hundred men, either killed or captured by the French. (The Duke himself was among the French prisoners.) On 28 September, the French army returned to Pforzheim and established a camp. It was reported that the entire Enz valley between the village of Eutingen east of Pforzheim and the village of Birkenfeld west of Pforzheim was occupied by the 30,000 French soldiers' camps. From their base in Pforzheim, French army units obviously under the leadership of Marshal de Chamilly advanced along the river valleys of Nagold and Würm and looted and destroyed the villages and towns of Huchenfeld, Calw, Hirsau, Liebenzell and Zavelstein. They also destroyed Liebeneck castle about 10kilometres from Pforzheim towering above the Würm valley, where part of the Pforzheim town archives were hidden. The archive was burned. Another part of the town archive as well as documents of Baden administrative office had been brought to Calw, where <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> in flames, too.|$|E
