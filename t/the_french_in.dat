5|$|Fort Cumberland {{was located}} on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects modern {{mainland}} Nova Scotia with New Brunswick. The area was strategically important in earlier conflicts between the French colony of Acadia and British-controlled Nova Scotia. Originally built by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> 1750 as Fort Beauséjour, Fort Cumberland was in deplorable condition. Won from <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Fort Beauséjour in 1755, the fortifications had been minimally garrisoned by the British after the Seven Years' War and abandoned in 1768.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Sir John Balchen (2 February 1670 – 4 October 1744), {{sometimes}} {{written as}} Balchin, was {{an officer of}} the British Royal Navy with a long and distinguished career during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

5|$|Calls for the {{abolition}} of Europe's monarchies have been widespread since the development of republicanism in the 17th to 18th centuries during the Enlightenment. During the French Revolution, the Ancien Régime in France was abolished, and in all territories the French First Republic conquered during the following Coalition Wars, sister republics were proclaimed. However, after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> 1804, all of these (except Switzerland) were converted back to monarchies headed by his relatives. The post-Napoleonic European Restoration reaffirmed the monarchical balance of power on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military use by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, {{but since the}} development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

5|$|East Tilbury, {{which stands}} at {{the western end of}} the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers. Settlements {{on both sides of the}} Thames were raided by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> 1379 during the second phase of the Hundred Years' War. The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a {{cooperated with}} Barakat {{in an attempt}} to unify {{northern}} Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against <b>the</b> <b>French,</b> <b>in</b> allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus.

Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his iṣābā, who he and his aides trained.|$|E

5|$|Having {{joined the}} army in 1746, Howe saw {{extensive}} service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years' War.

5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>in</b> the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
