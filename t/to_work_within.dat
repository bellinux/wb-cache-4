Baldorioty de Castro founded the Partido Autonomista in 1887, but he was only able <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> {{it for a few}} months. He was tried and imprisoned in Fort San Felipe del Morro, after being accused of publishing propaganda that affected the Spanish government's image. He was released after a brief period in jail, but his time in prison affected his health, which contributed to his death on September 30, 1889.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E

The {{national}} Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the Union Pacific Railroad, {{because it did not}} want to be seen as condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the Union Pacific Coal Department reopened the mines, it fired 45 white miners connected to the violence.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knoxâ€“Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> the framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won little support, and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the guillotine in 1793.|$|E

There it {{joined the}} British 27th Infantry Brigade, a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British government {{as the situation}} deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker. Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad, the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment (1 ASHR), the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (1 MR) and 3 RAR. Under strength, the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks, while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment, and had no integral artillery support, for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951. As such, with a strength of nearly 1,000 men, the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> a familiar organisational environment, rather than being attached to a US formation. Also {{under the command of}} the brigade were a number of US Army units, including 155mm howitzers from the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion, M4 Sherman tanks from US 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the US 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion.|$|E

5|$|To gain {{political}} power in favor of prohibition legislation, a state Prohibition Party was formed in 1884; however, it {{was never able to}} effectively mobilize a significant force of voters within the state. Many temperance advocates continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>within</b> the more established political parties. The liquor issue pitted wets and drys in stable uncompromising coalitions that formed a main theme of Hoosier politics into the 1930s. One legislative success occurred in 1895, when the state legislature passed the Nicholson law, a local option law authored by S. E. Nicholson, a Quaker minister who served in the state legislature and was a leader of the national Anti-Saloon League. The League became a {{political power}}house, mobilizing pietistic Protestant voters (that is, members of the major denominations except Lutherans and Episcopalians) to support dry legislation. The Nicholson law allowed voters in a city or township to file a remonstrance that would prevent an individual saloon owner from acquiring a liquor license. Additional legislative efforts to extend the Nicholson law and achieve statewide prohibition in Indiana would not occur until the early twentieth century. One of the leading supporters for the temperance movement in Indiana was Emma Barrett Molloy, who was {{an active member of the}} WCTU and lectured across the country to promote the ban of alcohol. Through her vocal activism in temperance and prohibition, Molloy also entered into the women's suffrage sphere as a strong supported for women's rights, particularly freedom of speech.|$|E

25|$|Within samizdat, several works {{focused on}} the {{possibility}} of a democratic political system.
