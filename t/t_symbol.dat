40|$|We analyze {{a mobile}} {{wireless}} link comprising M transmitter and N receiver antennas {{operating in a}} Rayleigh flat-fading environment. The propagation coefficients between every pair of transmitter and receiver antennas are statistically independent and unknown; they remain constant for a coherence interval of <b>T</b> <b>symbol</b> periods, after which they change to new independent values which they maintain for another <b>T</b> <b>symbol</b> periods, and so on. Computing the link capacity, associated with channel coding over multiple fading intervals, requires an optimization over the joint density of T M complex transmitted signals. We prove {{that there is no}} point in making the number of transmitter antennas greater than the length of the coherence interval: the capacity for M> Tis equal to the capacity for M = T. Capacity is achieved when the T M transmitted signal matrix is equal to the product of two statistically independent matrices: a T T isotropically distributed unitary matrix times a certain T M random matrix that is diagonal, real, and nonnegative. This result enables us to determine capacity for many interesting cases. We conclude that, for a fixed number of antennas, as the length of the coherence interval increases, the capacity approaches the capacity obtained as if the receiver knew the propagation coefficients...|$|E

In this paper, we define language independence for a propositional operator as robustness w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>symbol</b> translation. We provide a number of characterizations results for such translations. We motivate the {{need to focus on}} symbol translations of restricted types, and identify several families of interest. We identify the computational complexity of recognizing symbol translations from those families. Finally, as a case study, we investigate the robustness of belief revision/merging operators w. r. t. translations of different types. It turns out that rational belief revision/merging operators are not guaranteed to offer the most basic (yet non-trivial) form of language independence; operators based on the Hamming distance do not suffer from this drawback but are less robust than operators based on the drastic distance...|$|E

We prove that for T= 1, the gDoF is zero for MIMO channels with arbitrary link strength distributions, extending the result for MIMO with i. i. d links. We then show that selecting the statistically best antenna is gDoF-optimal for both Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) and Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) channels. We also derive the gDoF for the 2 × 2 MIMO channel with different exponents in the direct and cross links.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{capacity}} of multiple antenna fading channels. We focus on the scenario where the fading coefficients vary quickly; thus an accurate estimation of the coecients is generally not available to either the transmitter or the receiver. We use a non-coherent block fading model proposed by Marzetta and Hochwald. The model does not assume any channel side information at the receiver or at the transmitter, but assumes that the coefficients remain constant for a coherence interval of length <b>T</b> <b>symbol</b> periods. We compute the asymptotic capacity of this channel at high SNR, {{in terms of the}} coherence time T, the number of transmit antennas M and the number of receive antennas N. While the capacity gain of the coherent multiple antenna channel is minfM;Ng bps/Hz for every 3 dB increase in SNR, the corresponding gain for the non-coherent channel turns out to be M (1 M =T) bps/Hz, where M = minfM;N; bT= 2 cg.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of a coded FDFR system obtained by concatenating an error control coding (ECC) module and an FDFR module with a random interleaver in between. Iterative decoding is performed at the receiver. With R c denoting the ECC rate, and d the minimum Hamming distance, an overall transfer rate of R c N <b>t</b> <b>symbols</b> per channel use and a full diversity order dN t N r are achieved. Compared with coded VBLAST, without sacrificing rate the coded FDFR system offers evident performance improvement when relatively weak codes are used. As N r increases, even such a strong code as rate 1 / 2 turbo codes can benefit from FDFR. Specifically, 1. 5 dB gain over coded V-BLAST is obtained in a 22 antenna setup when convolutional codes or rate 3 / 4 turbo codes are used. 0. 5 dB gain is offered in a 25 setup when rate 1 / 2 turbo code is used.

It is ap-plied in genome and proteome analysis for discovering interesting biose-quences which are usually very short {{when compared to the}} length of the analyzed sequence. Abstraction of subsequences, that is grouping similar subsequences and representing them in a compact way as patterns, seems particularly useful in the field of pattern discovery in order to stress sim-ilarities among interesting subsequences. In this paper we propose a set of techniques for pattern discovery which makes use of abstraction. We define a data structure, the k-trie, which is an enriched and truncated suffix trie, for collecting and counting subsequences of length at most k. We propose an on-line algorithm for building a k-trie in linear time. We associate the chi-square score to the subsequences represented in the tree in order to estimate their ”interest”. By analyzing the properties of the score w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>symbol</b> concatenation and string abstraction, we derive a method for collecting the most interesting subsequences in an automatic way. Besides, we abstract a set of subsequences of the same length into a set of rigid patterns. Such abstraction may be represented by a tree corresponding to the prefix automaton associated to the set of patterns. We propose to use such trees for concisely representing the most inter-esting subsequences, for searching patterns and for comparing biological sequences...|$|E
