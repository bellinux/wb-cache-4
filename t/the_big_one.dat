5|$|Ostapchuk {{vowed to}} return the Princess to the stature it held under Susan Morrow. To that end, he hired a new film programmer, Leonard Schein of Vancouver’s Fifth Avenue Cinemas. The first film {{exhibited}} under new management was Michael Moore’s <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b> Ostapchuk began major renovations to the theatre, and in 1999 unveiled The Princess II in Chinook Theatre’s old space. The basement theatre featured 100 seats, its own concession and washrooms, and a new 35mm projector. The renovations cost $200,000.|$|E

Critical response to Growing <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere.|$|E

25|$|Many Dallas players {{described}} this game {{as the most}} devastating loss of the 1966–1970 period. Having lost this game and the 1966 title game in the waning seconds of each game, Landry was subject to criticism that {{he was unable to}} win <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One,</b> a stigma that persisted until Dallas won its first NFL title in the 1971 season. In the three seasons following 1967, the Cowboys suffered two upsets in the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns, then lost Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts 13–16 on a last-second field goal. Schramm considered this game to be turning point to Dallas becoming America's Team {{because of the way the}} Cowboys battled back in the game.|$|E
25|$|For his 2013 season, Vickers {{performed}} well at Bristol. His second {{ride in the}} No. 55 at Martinsville was unlucky. He had crashed in the early laps and after repairing his car, got back on the lead lap and then spun around. After again getting back on to the lead lap, on the final lap of the race he passed Danica Patrick for 11th place. Seconds later he was intentionally spun by Kevin Harvick who was angry with Vickers for prior contact. In reply Vickers bumped Harvick when entering pit road after the race was over; he climbed out and the two briefly argued. Vickers ran the No. 11 FedEx Toyota at Texas, Kansas and Richmond for an injured Denny Hamlin. Though Hamlin returned at Talladega for the Aaron's 499, Vickers substituted for him on lap 23, though he was eventually collected in <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> less than 15 laps after the switch.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 2011, the World Series of Poker and Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté {{announced}} plans for an officially sanctioned special fundraising event, known as <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> for One Drop, starting on July 1, 2012 with a record US$1 million entry fee. 11% of the money (more precisely, $111,111 from each buy-in) went to Laliberté's charity, the One Drop Foundation, and the WSOP waived its normal 10% rake of the entry fees. At {{the time of the}} original announcement, 15 of the maximum 48 seats had been taken. By early December 2011, the field size had increased to 22, the minimum required for an official bracelet tournament. Among those who committed early to the event were Johnny Chan, Daniel Negreanu, Jonathan Duhamel, Tom Dwan, Laliberté, billionaire businessman Phil Ruffin and Erik Seidel. On April 12, 2012, the WSOP announced that 30 players had committed to the tournament, which brought the first prize to $12.3 million, exceeding the record amount won by Jamie Gold. In the end, all 48 seats were filled, resulting in a first prize of $18.3 million. Poker professional Antonio Esfandiari won the event, also receiving a special platinum WSOP bracelet.|$|E
25|$|Mayall starred {{alongside}} Phoebe Cates in Drop Dead Fred (1991) as the eponymous character, a troublesome imaginary {{friend who}} reappears from a woman's childhood. He {{also appeared in}} Carry On Columbus (1992) with other alternative comedians. Mayall also provided {{the voice of the}} character Froglip, the prince of the goblins, in the 1992 animated film adaption of the 1872 children's tale The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. In 1993, he appeared in Rik Mayall Presents, six individual comedy dramas (Micky Love / Briefest Encounter / Dancing Queen / <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> / Dirty Old Town / Clair de Lune). Mayall's performances won him a Best Comedy Performer award at that year's British Comedy Awards, and a second series of three was broadcast in early 1995. He provided the voice for Little Sod in Simon Brett's How to Be a Little Sod, written in 1991 and adapted as ten consecutive episodes broadcast by the BBC in 1995. In the early 1990s, he auditioned for the roles of Banzai, Zazu and Timon in The Lion King (1994); he was asked to audition by lyricist Tim Rice, but the role of Zazu finally went to Rowan Atkinson.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, RCR ran the 33 in {{the first}} two races of the season with Scott and his family's Whitetail Club. Scott {{finished}} fifth in his Daytona Duel to earn a spot in the Daytona 500, then finished 25th in the race after several accidents. Scott ran the next race at Phoenix, starting and finishing 32nd. Scott was involved in a controversy in the fifth race of the season at Fontana, when he spun out Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Series regular Aric Almirola, who expressed displeasure at Scott's driving and source of sponsorship after getting out of the car. Scott would finish 35th in that race. Brian then won the pole at the spring Talladega race, his first career Cup pole. Scott would not lead any laps, however, and finished 42nd after crashing out. 2000 Cup Champion Bobby Labonte, who was doing test driving for RCR, drove the same car at the summer Daytona race, under the Circle Sport banner. The car again had speed in qualifying, timing in 4th. Labonte would contend for the lead for much of the race but finish 26th after being swept up in <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b> Richard Childress' younger grandson Ty Dillon drove at Atlanta and Phoenix in the fall, with sponsorship from Rheem, Realtree and Charter Communications.|$|E
