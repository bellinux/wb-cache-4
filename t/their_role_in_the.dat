5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brown case and civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Along with Tony Todd, Larter is {{the only}} actor to reprise <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series.

Larter won a Young Hollywood Award for her role and was also nominated for a Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.|$|E
5|$|The band {{is known}} for its attention-grabbing image; the members perform wearing unique, {{individual}} facemasks and matching uniforms—typically jumpsuits—while each member is typically assigned and referred to by number based on <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band (#0 through #8), although the latter practice has diminished following the death of Paul Gray.|$|E

Following the war, the ICTY convicted Babić and Martić for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> events. Saborsko was subsequently rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The centennial {{commemoration}} of the Battle of Vimy Ridge {{took place at the}} memorial on 9 April 2017, coincidentally during the 150th anniversary of Canada. Estimates before the event indicated that an audience of up to 30,000 would be present. The Mayor of Arras, Frédéric Leturque, thanked Canadians, as well as Australians and British, New Zealanders, and South Africans, for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War battles in the area.|$|E
5|$|The local {{government}} announced {{on the morning}} of 3 July that the copper plant construction would be suspended. Protests continued into the evening, with demonstrators demanding the release of the detained protesters, most of whom were students. Late in the evening of 3 July, authorities released 21 of the 27 detained protesters. Protests subsided, though six remained in custody facing criminal and administrative charges for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> demonstrations.|$|E

40|$|Principals were {{struggling}} with <b>the</b> interpretation of <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of <b>the</b> NCS <b>in</b> South African schools, parlty {{due to the}} huge change {{and complexity of the}} NCS. It was found that principals did not understand <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the NCS, and as a result did not develop staff, were not familiar with the roles of educators as specified by policy and shifted the burden of developing educators to the Department of Education. A qualitative research approach was employed. A reputational case sampling was conducted on three secondary school principals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KZN Vryheid District. A semi structured interview and a semi-structured questionaire were employed on these three principals to gather data. Theme analysis was used to determine how principals interpreted <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the NCS. I found that principals did not have enough understanding of <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the NCS. However, principals complained that the Department of Education was more concerned about expanding access to education than quality of education. They also lamented that teachers had a low self- esteem with the profession. I found that principals required detailed workshops on <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the NCS, ongoing curriculum leadership training, and required LTSM resources and equipped laboratorie...|$|R

5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is {{the oxygen}} carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of lacquers.|$|E
5|$|The role of stay-at-home dad may be {{difficult}} for men who feel as though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a homemaker. Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family.|$|E
5|$|Their {{purchase}} by the Admiralty was organised by the London firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons, {{a partnership}} run by Alban Gibbs {{and his younger}} brother Vicary Gibbs. Both were Members of Parliament (MPs), and <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transaction meant that they were disqualified from the House of Commons, under an old law which debarred MPs from accepting contracts from the Crown. This triggered two by-elections, in which Alban was re-elected unopposed, but Vicary lost his seat.|$|E

5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> violence in 609.|$|E
5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged {{that while he}} was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E

5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation. Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1944, Marinić filed {{charges against}} Pulherija and Gaudencija before the Land Commission for the Determination of Crimes by the Occupiers and Their Supporters. Pulherija fled to Austria {{before the end}} of the war, the only one of the nuns to do so. Gaudencija {{remained}} at the Children's Home, eventually moving to Ljubljana. No extradition of Pulherija was ever attempted, and neither nun was ever declared a war criminal. According to Fumić, the inhumane actions of Pulherija and other nuns and <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deaths of many children has never been condemned by the Catholic Church. Pulherija died in Austria in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Ten were honoured for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operation, seven {{receiving}} Distinguished Service Medals, two the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and one, the grievously wounded Ritchie, the Victoria Cross. Ritchie had {{not initially}} been recommended for this award; the recommendation being submitted {{at a later}} date by an unidentified figure in the Admiralty. Snelling speculates that the Admiralty's change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure, although Ritchie's courage during the action was never called into question. The shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in the raid were extensive, including injuries to his forehead, left thumb, left arm (twice), right arm, right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets.|$|E

5|$|The NEDD9 {{promoter}} has 2 transcriptional start sites. The transcript variants NM_006403.3 and NM_001142393.1 encode {{proteins that}} have distinct N-termini (MKYK and MWTR, respectively). In mouse, the two alternative first exons are MKYK and MWAR. Their function is not known. NM_001142393 initiates translation at an upstream location compared to NM_006403.3, but both transcripts have 7 exons. Shorter transcripts with missing exons or an alternative 3' terminal exon {{have been detected}} in various studies; however, <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controversy.|$|E
