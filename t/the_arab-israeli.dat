5|$|During his term, Harper {{has dealt}} with many foreign policy issues {{relating}} to the United States, the War on Terror, <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict, free trade, China, and Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council {{resolution}} condemning Israeli settlements, {{with the}} United States {{being the only}} nation to do so. Obama supports the two-state solution to <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of the West German attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict. The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with the Six-Day War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> 1948 <b>Arab–Israeli</b> War or <b>the</b> First <b>Arab–Israeli</b> War {{was fought}} between the State of Israel and a {{military}} coalition of Arab states, forming {{the second stage of}} the 1948 Palestine war.|$|R
25|$|Religious Zionists often {{point to}} Israel's {{seemingly}} miraculous survival in <b>the</b> numerous <b>Arab-Israeli</b> wars, especially <b>the</b> 1948 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War and Six-Day War, and interpret {{this as the}} State of Israel being preserved directly by God's hand.|$|R
50|$|Relations between Egypt and the United States {{have been}} {{continuous}} since 1848, {{except for the}} period between 1967 and 1974. The then United Arab Republic severed relations with the U.S. following <b>the</b> 1967 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War; Egypt restored relations following <b>the</b> 1973 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War.|$|R
5|$|The M9 {{served for}} a {{significant}} amount of time. 3,500 were produced by the end of World War II. It was used during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Six-Day War, and the Yom Kippur War. It had been used by eleven different countries by the end of its service.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{was used}} in World War II, <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, and many other conflicts. The {{production}} of M9s was leased to other countries, like most other IH half-tracks produced in World War II. This M9A1 was leased to both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the latter providing it to {{other countries in the}} British Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the gun was}} {{supplied}} to many countries around the globe, including former Warsaw Pact allies, such as Poland. As of the early 2000s it remains in service in Afghanistan, Albania, China, Cuba, Hungary, Iraq, Mozambique, Syria, Vietnam and other countries. The gun was employed in <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> Conflict and also in some conflicts in former republics of Soviet Union. The long operational history of D-1 howitzers in the national armies of numerous countries is an additional testimony to its qualities.|$|E

50|$|The Gaza Strip {{is defined}} by the 1949 Armistice lines {{following}} <b>the</b> 1948 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> war. About 1.1 of 1.5 million residents of Gaza are registered as refugees from the war. Egypt occupied Gaza from 1948 to 1967 and with <b>the</b> 1967 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War Israel became the occupying power.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>the</b> 1967 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War and <b>the</b> {{adoption}} of UN Security Council Resolution 242, Jarring {{was appointed by}} the UN Secretary-General U Thant as a special envoy for the Middle East peace process, the so-called Jarring Mission. Jarring's methods of negotiation were used unsuccessfully until <b>the</b> 1973 <b>Arab-Israeli</b> War.|$|R
5|$|By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union {{were focused}} on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their {{military}} situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make the solution of <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Dukovac {{joined the}} Syrian Air Force in 1946. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, {{he was a}} captain in No. 1 Squadron of the Syrian Air Force, based in Estabal in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Following the end of <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> War, Dukovac emigrated to Canada. He settled in Toronto and started a family there. He worked for IBM and was a co-founder {{of one of the}} largest Croatian émigré organisations in Canada, the United Croats of Canada. He died in Toronto in September 1990.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. <b>The</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict, including {{the rise of the}} Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> {{conflict}} {{is a modern}} phenomenon, which {{has its roots in}} the end of the 19th century. The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of Israel in 1948. <b>The</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (s).|$|E
