5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby <b>Thore</b> (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line).

Gunnar Örlygsson, the team's chairman, compared Bonneau with Lionel Messi in terms of impact on the club. During a pre-season training in September he suffered an achilles tendon rupture. Bonneau stayed in Iceland for rehabilitation, with an intent to join the team in the play-offs.

Andersen had broken into German barracks in Vadheim in Sogn during a {{drinking}} binge, killing the German soldiers Herbert Neumann and Hermann Beckmann. He later claimed to have acted in rage over his wife's death. The Norwegian court system started working on Andersen's case, eventually reaching judge advocate Ivar Follestad. Andersen was defended by Reidar Skau, who was made Supreme Court Justice in 1945. Follestad deemed it necessary to prosecute Andersen, but wanted to pardon him after the verdict. After spending {{more than a year}} in the civilian and military court systems Andersen's murder case reached the top levels of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and on 5 August 1946 it was decided to take the case to the Gulating Military Court of Appeal. Three months later Follestad made a decision of non-indictment, despite there being evidence to convict Andersen. In January 1947 the general jurisdiction chief, <b>Thore</b> Horve, also declared for a decision of non-indictment. Follestad and Horve were supported in this by Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge, and the decision was made final by royal resolution on 25 April 1947.

Self-perceived Psychological Health and Vascular Changes in Childhood Walter Osika Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden. Thesis defended June 13, 2007. Abstract There is strong evidence that cardiovascular disease (CVD) has its origin in childhood, and that childhood cardiovascular risk factors and various other forms of adversity track into adulthood. Poorer psychological health and psychosocial factors are associated with CVD in adults, and this association is also likely to have its origins in childhood. There are no well-established validated questionnaires specifically designed to measure stress in childhood and adolescence. Currently available methods to study early atherosclerotic changes in vascular wall layers are restricted to relatively crude measurements because of low resolution. Measuring the various vessel wall layers separately will facilitate the study of early atherosclerotic changes. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop non-invasive techniques which make it possible to detect early changes in vascular wall structures in a healthy, young population and to study associations of vascular wall structure and function with self-perceived psychological health. Our hypothesis was that psychological health, particularly “stress”, is associated with endocrine measures of stress system activation and with endothelial function, and that sex differences in vascular wall function and structure already exist among the young. A self-assessment questionnaire designed to measure perceived stress in children (SiC) was constructed. Cronbach’s α for the entire SiC questionnaire was 0. 86, and higher stress scores were associated with higher morning saliva cortisol levels in girls. The recently introduced Beck Youth Inventories (BYI) of Emotional and Social Impairment were also associated with saliva cortisol levels in girls. The new very high resolution ultrasound system (55 MHz, Visualsonics) was validated in vitro and in humans. The resolution of ~ 25 μm made it possible to study the intima separately from the media. Greater intima thickness (IT) in the radial artery was seen in boys compared with girls (0. 057 ± 0. 010 vs. 0. 054 ± 0. 008, p= 0. 007). IT also increased with age (10 - 17 vs 60 - 90 years, 0. 049 ± 0. 008 to 0. 081 ± 0. 019 mm), and was thicker in peripheral artery disease patients compared with healthy controls (0. 089 ± 0. 017 vs. 0. 074 ± 0. 011 mm; P= 0. 05) and in the dorsal pedal artery (0. 074 ± 0. 030 mm) compared with the radial artery IT (0. 064 ± 0. 019 mm; P= 0. 007). A total of 248 children (age 14. 5 ± 1. 0 years, 136 girls, 112 boys) underwent reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) testing, a measure of endothelial function predictive of cardiovascular disease in adults. Information on self-assessed psychological health was also collected for these subjects. No sex differences were observed for the RH-PAT score (1. 82 ± 0. 55). Girls had higher scores for depression, anger and anxiety, and they showed statistically significant associations between lower RH-PAT values and higher scores for anger, depression and anxiety. Among boys, disruptive behaviour was associated with higher RH-PAT scores indicating better endothelial function. In conclusion, identifying early changes in both vascular function and psychological health in childhood demands high quality sensitive methods. Self–perceived psychological health was associated with endothelial function; and there were sex differences in structural vascular changes. These findings in childhood underline the importance of adopting a broad perspective on childhood and adolescence health to reduce adult CVD risk.
