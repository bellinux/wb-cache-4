5|$|In November 1957, <b>the</b> <b>Arthur</b> Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot vertical lift bridge in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on <b>the</b> <b>Arthur</b> Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Boston, Mass., they both put off seeking out <b>the</b> <b>Arthur's</b> Chosen, {{not wanting to}} end the trip and the romance that has {{developed}} between them.

Derek barges into the warehouse, after having been warned by Antonia that he will die if he enters <b>the</b> warehouse. <b>The</b> <b>Arthur's</b> Chosen release Sara after draining some of her blood and start working on the resurrection, which they can't finish however, because Derik and Sara interfere. The interrupted spell sets free a demon who immediately starts to kill everyone, and would - as Sara sees in a vision - have extinguished all life on earth. After the demon has killed all of <b>the</b> <b>Arthur's</b> Chosen, he severely wounds Derik, breaking his neck, but is attacked by Sara, who, in another nearly-impossible lucky event kills it by simply kicking it with her foot, thus saving the world.|$|R

5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} <b>the</b> <b>Arthur</b> Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at <b>the</b> <b>Arthur</b> Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E
