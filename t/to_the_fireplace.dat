5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
25|$|The {{pavilion}} {{has been}} completely redecorated, {{and most of the}} Baroque woodwork has been removed. The decorative tiles, reflecting the high quality craftsmanship of the İznik tile industry of the 17th century, were removed in accordance with the original concept and replaced with modern copies. The paintwork of the wooden dome is still original and {{is an example of the}} rich designs of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. The fireplace in the second room has a tall, gilded hood and has been restored to its original appearance. The window shutters next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> are decorated with nacre intarsia. The windows in coloured glass look out across the high terrace and the garden of the pool below. The spigots in these windows are surrounded with red, black and gold designs.|$|E
50|$|Fire screens {{were used}} <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> when nothing was burning inside it, {{and make it}} look more decorative.|$|R
50|$|Its {{kindergarten}} area once {{housed a}} fireplace, which, {{along with its}} chimney, was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school by Ima Hogg. In 2005 <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> teacher's lounge during renovations, and it was later placed in the attic. As of 2010 there were efforts <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> with donations being the source of funding. Azalea flowers, used in the landscaping of various Houston landmarks, have been present in the landscaping of this school.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} old buildings, the {{ceilings}} are quite low. An original bread-oven is next <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> It {{has a large}} beer garden with different seating arrangements, as well as seats out the front.|$|R
500|$|The Ballroom, {{also known}} as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and {{according}} to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme [...] "Ride a cock horse", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, {{also known as}} the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> was thought to have been a priest hole, but is {{more likely to have been}} the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|.....The chief warder {{shows me}} the black smoked pot, filled with some food: 'I need your medical {{expertise}} regarding this meat.' I {{look into the}} pot, and hardly hold vomiting. The fibres of that meat are very small, and don't resemble me anything I have seen before. The skin on some pieces bristles with black hair (...) A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.|$|E

50|$|As {{cast-iron}} range cookers {{were brought}} into common use, it became standard practice {{to build a}} dividing wall <b>to</b> split <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> into two separate fireplaces, thus allowing access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clome oven, {{as well as providing}} a space of <b>the</b> correct dimensions <b>to</b> fit a Cornish range or similar. Bricks were the most common building material for this task, since the installation of a Cornish range required a brick flue to be built up the back of <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Many clome ovens were preserved in situ in this way.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that it was Best who made the renovations in the then-popular Greek Revival mode. The house's roof is pitched more steeply than usual for that style (as the narrow {{weatherboard}} siding is unusual for Claverack), but otherwise it lent itself well <b>to</b> <b>the</b> renovations. <b>The</b> <b>fireplaces</b> were moved {{from the center of}} <b>the</b> basement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls, the upstairs closets installed and the rear porch and wellhouse added. The kitchen wing remained unaltered. A front portico that echoes one installed in a contemporary renovation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courthouse was also added.|$|R
50|$|Chimneys {{were invented}} in {{northern}} Europe in the 11th or 12th centuries and largely fixed {{the problem of}} fumes, more reliably venting smoke outside. They made it possible <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> a draft, and also {{made it possible to}} put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|R

50|$|In 1937 {{his wife}} Athena {{died of cancer}} in Hilo. A fire {{destroyed}} the hotel in 1940, ironically from a kitchen oil burner, not volcanic lava. Only a few artifacts, such as a koa wood piano were saved.

50|$|Sally opens <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> {{creatures and}} finds {{one of the}} old housekeeper's teeth. The creatures quickly prove to be hostile, {{stealing}} Alex's razor and shredding Kim's clothes. Alex immediately blames Sally and finds a 19th-century silver coin in her possession, which she found under her pillow after the tooth disappeared. Alex and Kim head into town on a business trip and Sally sneaks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basement <b>to</b> talk with <b>the</b> creatures, but Harris sends her away and tries <b>to</b> seal <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> <b>The</b> creatures emerge and brutally wound him with his own tools and he is hospitalized. Sally's increasingly frightening encounters with the creatures prompt Alex to call a therapist to talk to Sally, who draws a sketch of one of the creatures that attacked her under her bedsheets.|$|R

50|$|A {{cesspool}} was conveniently, but unhygienically {{located just}} outside {{the back door of}} the kitchen in the courtyard, with a channel running <b>to</b> it from <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Other pipes linked to this channel from garderobes upstairs. A good number of different mason's marks are located on the stonework in the entrance pend and elsewhere. The building may have been harled, a form of roughcast.|$|R
50|$|As an inventor, Lerner is {{best known}} for his Excessive Temperature Warning Device patent. After seeing the trauma that {{children}} can suffer from gas fireplace burns, he created an alert system designed <b>to</b> flash when <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> glass is at a hazardous temperature. He continues to work with various manufacturers to realize his goal of reducing or eliminating pediatric burns due to gas fireplaces.|$|R
50|$|Originally tile stoves {{placed in}} each room heated the palace. The tile in the Antechamber was used later <b>to</b> line <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Guests waited in <b>the</b> {{antechamber}} <b>to</b> be granted audience with <b>the</b> Duke. Due <b>to</b> an adaptation in the 19th century, it {{is a kind}} of Mirror Hall with two Venetian mirrors made in the 18th century on the Italian island of Murano. The only objects original <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room are a set of four chests used by <b>the</b> Duke <b>to</b> hold his wardrobe. They are Italian chests made around the turn of the 17th century.|$|R

50|$|Ground floor {{dining rooms}} and sitting room have plaster {{ceilings}} with elaborate circular surrounds to central lights. Doors are cedar panelled with rectangular fan lights over. Deep cornices and pelmets are of moulded cedar. The front dining room has walls of full height cedar, with 4 inch 100mm beaded vertical boarding above <b>the</b> panelling <b>to</b> dado height. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> is dark grey marble. The sitting room has full height cedar panelling {{and a white}} marble <b>fireplace.</b> <b>The</b> formal dining room opposite has rendered walls with deep cedar skirting. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> is painted. <b>The</b> adjoining office has an angled fireplace sheeted over.

50|$|In 1995 and 1996, Mount Ida was {{reclaimed}} as {{pasture and}} {{the foundations of}} the old Dawson/Brockenborough house unearthed. The Department of Archeology of The College of William &Mary conducted an archeological study of the site and the ruins discovered the original hard wrought iron chimney arch used in <b>the</b> first <b>fireplace</b> of <b>the</b> 1799 home. This arch and original brick from the Dawson ruins were used <b>to</b> recreate <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in <b>the</b> basement family room of the Mount Ida addition, allowing a fireplace to rest at this location for two hundred years. In early 1998, the Department of Historic Resources announced Mount Ida’s preliminary approval by the staff for eventual relisting on the Landmarks Register. With the relocation and restoration now complete, Mount Ida awaits confirmation of this prestigious designation.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of Chadwick House is the two verandas facing east and south-east overlooking the garden. The verandas have an unusual double ox-bow balustrading. The tiled roof is a collection of gabled and hip roofs. The lower part of the house is clad with double beveled weatherboards while the upper part comprises rough cast panels separated by vertical timbers and this pattern is extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gables. The house exhibits many technological innovations including wall recessed, sliding window sashes, modular wall-framing and convection heating vents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> <b>The</b> large timber door which slides <b>to</b> conceal <b>the</b> front dining room is further evidence of the technical innovation employed in the house. The house has a balloon frame construction which was introduced to Australia from California in the mid-nineteenth century. The weatherboards and timber are charcoal grey, the veranda balustrades are yellow and the panels of rough cast are orange/ochre in colour. The interior is an open plan design which at the time was a radical departure from contemporary designs. There is no extended hallway but rather a small entrance hall from which the main living areas are accessed. From these rooms there is access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen and bedrooms. The sloping site allowed two rooms to be built under the main house. Their initial use was as office space for Desbrowe-Annear. Much of the interior comprises dark stained timber with a raked timber lined ceiling and built-in joinery. Until 1988 much of the original timber work was lost under layers of paint and plaster or had been removed. The renovations took place over a ten-year period and endeavoured <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> building <b>to</b> its original condition. In some cases appropriate timber had to be sourced to replace and repair the initial ‘improvements’.|$|R
50|$|In February to September 1519, Antonio Correggio was {{commissioned}} by the Abbess Giovanna Piacenza <b>to</b> decorated <b>the</b> domed ceiling of her private dining room, now called the Camera di San Paolo.

Below the oculi are lunettes with monochromic scenes painted <b>to</b> simulate marble. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> is frescoed with an depiction of the goddess Diana. The frescoes are {{considered one of the}} masterpieces of Italian Renaissance art.|$|R
