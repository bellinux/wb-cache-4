5|$|RNA {{replication}} is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The {{enzymes that}} copy RNA to new RNA, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, {{are also found}} in many eukaryotes where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> RNA silencing.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> more covalent interactions. This occurs during hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing {{in the infrared}} can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E

5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{building}} reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become {{the framework of the}} reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|With NHL players {{participating}} in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status {{was given to the}} IIHF World Under-20 Championship, which had been held annually since 1974 as an unofficial invitational tournament. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. The World Under-18 Championship was established in 1999 and typically held in April. It usually does not involve some of the top North American-based players because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> junior league playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E

Gilly proposes to Beth, who agrees to make Rhys, {{who is in}} a {{relationship}} with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), jealous. Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) catches Rhys and Beth kissing and tells Gilly, who refuses to believe. Later, Michaela tells Gilly to go home in an attempt to make him see the truth. Gilly does so and catches Rhys and Beth sleeping together. He begins to beat up Rhys and calls the police. Realising they face a prison sentence for incest, Rhys and Beth leave Hollyoaks, however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a car crash which results in Beth's death. After time away, Rhys returns and he and Gilly decide to make up.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Mangel {{offers to}} help Daphne paint the nursery {{and she is}} knocked off a ladder by Mike's pet Labrador, Bouncer, and suffers amnesia. Mrs. Mangel threatens to sue and Des decides to settle out of court, so that Daphne does not become stressed. But when Daphne learns what Des has done, she is angry with him for keeping it from her. During a picnic, Daphne goes into labour and Beverly Marshall (Lisa Armytage) {{delivers}} her son, Jamie. Daphne briefly suffers from postnatal depression following Jamie's birth. During Jamie's christening, Daphne's mother, Tina, turns up. She and Daphne {{sit down and talk}} through their problems and part on speaking terms. Shortly after, Daphne learns that her father is dying. Des persuades her to make things right with Allen. Daphne then decides to nurse her father and she takes Jamie to stay with him. Months later, Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke) offers to drive Daphne and Jamie back to Ramsay Street after Allen's funeral. During the journey, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a car crash, which leaves Daphne in a coma. Des stays by her side and is holding her hand when she briefly wakes up to tell him that she loves him. Daphne then suffers a cardiac arrest and dies.|$|E
5|$|The City Council has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) {{to cover the}} council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. They also evaluate local planning applications {{and work with the}} local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. This includes city centre management including CCTV, an alcohol ban and regulating street trading permissions including the two funfairs held in the Market Place in May and November each year and the Wells In Bloom competition. The city council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of city facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the management of the Community Sports Development Centre at the Blue School, the skateboard park and allotments in the grounds of the Bishop's Palace, Burcott Road and Barnes Close.

5|$|The {{participation}} {{of these two}} annual ceremonies are considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{some of the most}} important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the proclamation from the council in person. The proclamation is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken rope (in place of the ancient bar) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where the proclamation would be read. Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.|$|E

50|$|Further work by Edwards and Rose has {{identified}} oval-shaped growths in {{places on the}} cuticles of {{a limited number of}} Nematothallus fragments, which develop into holes - whose purpose <b>is</b> unknown. Since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not found in all Nematothallus individuals, it <b>is</b> unlikely that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> gas exchange - perhaps <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the release of spores? One fossil gives the impression, which may well be an illusion, of spores being trapped between two layers of cuticle.|$|R
