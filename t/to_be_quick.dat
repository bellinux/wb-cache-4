5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick,</b> reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E
5|$|While the tricking of a {{tortoise}} was {{the most}} popular method in Bulgarian mythology, in Dalmatia the legend refers to snakes, and among Serbs another version involves the locking of young hedgehogs in a box for their mother to unlock. In Serbia, one would also have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> to take the raskovnik, as the hedgehog would swallow it after use. In any case, turtles, snakes and hedgehogs are all animals with chthonic characteristics which were often variously associated with the underworld in South Slavic tradition.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas by him and co-founder Ted Dabney. The final design was done by Dabney, {{possibly}} with assistance by Bushnell and Pong designer Allan Alcorn. The game was planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco {{before the rest of}} the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet.|$|E

However, during {{a case in which}} three women are charged with raping a male stripper, Benson and ADA Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) <b>are</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> believe the man's story, while Stabler takes a cynical view of his claim from the start.|$|R
5|$|After the {{briefing}} Phu immediately {{returned to his}} headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy Tat, and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using only word of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local regional forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick,</b> with the army taking only enough military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} {{time of the}} third practice session, a 1:15.965. Häkkinen was second fastest, almost two-tenths of a second off Coulthard's pace. The two Jordan drivers were running quicker; Trulli in third and Frentzen in fourth. Both Jaguars continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> with Irvine fifth and Herbert eighth. The two were separated by Michael Schumacher and Button. Barrichello and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was unable to improve his time because of an engine failure though he remained fastest. Häkkinen managed to set a quicker time and remained with the second quickest lap. Barrichello ran quicker and was third fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers remained fastest–Trulli was fifth and Frentzen sixth–their best times two thousands of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher who concentrated on qualifying set-up. Button and Herbert completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

25|$|The Pledge was {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> {{and to the}} point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in {{a process known as}} shechitah. Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered treif. The slaughtering process is intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} these {{multiple}} firings from multiple areas {{to be combined}} into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the dorsal thalamus. It is not proven whether the dorsal thalamus is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between {{what is happening in}} the brain and outside of it. The space in and around the dorsal thalamus, the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be GABAergic. Since sensory awareness needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick,</b> the threshold for sodium and potassium in this area is quite low.|$|E

50|$|Most {{countries}} {{prefer a}} quicker openside flanker {{with the ability}} to get off the scrum quickly so that he can scavenge for the ball. In South Africa, however, it is preferred for the blindside flanker <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quicker</b> as it <b>is</b> often their duty to carry the ball, meaning they prefer the person running with the ball being quicker rather than the person trying steal it.|$|R
25|$|The plan British Eagle {{developed}} in early 1966 for its future fleet requirements aimed to have 25 {{aircraft in service}} {{by the end of}} the decade, envisaging the operation of 15 jet aircraft — including two widebodies — and 10 turboprop planes. The former were to comprise two Boeing 747 freighters, five 707-320Cs for the carriage of both passengers and cargo and eight BAC One-Elevens — the last three of which were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Quick</b> Change (QC) models that could either be used as passenger or freight carriers. The latter were to consist of 10 Britannias. The end of a number of Ministry of Defence contracts in 1966 saw the airline with surplus aircraft and two Britannias were sold to Air Spain.|$|E

500|$|After a {{dominant}} performance by Mercedes in the [...] season, pre-season testing for the 2015 season proved {{they would still}} be fastest of the field. The new Williams FW37 looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quick</b> and reliable, while Ferrari in particular seemed {{to have made a}} big step forward. Former four-time world champions Red Bull ran a car in black-and-white camouflage, that did nothing to disguise the fact that the Austrian team still struggled with problems concerning their Renault engines, doing the second least laps during the first test days in Jerez. While Lotus, Toro Rosso and Sauber were considered to be contesting for points with considerable advances made over the winter, the new partnership between McLaren and Honda got off to a bad start. The team managed only 380 laps, almost half of the next worst team, Force India. Furthermore, Fernando Alonso, who had signed back to the team after his controversial [...] season, crashed during the second testing session in Barcelona and missed the first race of the season. Force India struggled to get their new car, the VJM08, on track. After missing the first test in Jerez, they started testing with their 2014 car in Barcelona before introducing their new model late.|$|E
