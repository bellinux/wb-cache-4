5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the next half-hour. In a rare instance, {{the doors of the}} Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> casket.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{reactions}} <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p→e+e− and <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcee+e−→p¯p {{are analyzed}} in the near-threshold region. Specific emphasis {{is put on}} {{the role played by}} the interaction in the initial or final antinucleon–nucleon (<b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourceN¯N) system which is taken into account rigorously. For that purpose a recently published <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourceN¯N potential derived within chiral effective field theory and fitted to results of a new partial-wave analysis of <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p scattering data is employed. Our results provide strong support for the conjecture that the pronounced energy dependence of <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcee+e−↔p¯p cross section, seen in pertinent experiments, is primarily due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p interaction. Predictions for the proton electromagnetic form factors GEGE and GMGM in the timelike region, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourceN¯N threshold, and for spin-dependent observables are presented. The steep rise of the effective form factor for energies close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p threshold is explained solely in terms of <b>the</b> <b>View</b> <b>the</b> MathML sourcep¯p interaction. The corresponding experimental information is quantitatively described by our calculation...|$|R

50|$|A further {{step towards}} the {{flexibility}} of use consists {{in the design and}} production of the shiftable viewfinder with interchangeable frames. The viewfinder is extremely useful for quick works and in difficult work situations compared <b>to</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>the</b> image on the ground glass.|$|R
5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> Rolling Stones as an outdated band.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{sector in}} South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> attractions of the state, {{particularly those in}} the Black Hills region, such as historic Deadwood, Mount Rushmore, and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The five-day event drew over 739,000 attendees in 2015; significant considering {{the state has a}} total population of 850,000. In 2006, tourism provided an estimated 33,000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion dollars to the economy of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E

5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
5|$|Executing {{the design}} was slow: Little was {{actually}} completed in Michelangelo's lifetime (the Cordonata Capitolina {{was not in}} place when Emperor Charles arrived, and the imperial party had to scramble up the slope from the Forum <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> works in progress), but work continued faithfully to his designs and the Campidoglio was completed in the 17th century, except for the paving design, {{which was to be}} finished three centuries later.|$|E

5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades through a telescope.

5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>the</b> horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.|$|E
