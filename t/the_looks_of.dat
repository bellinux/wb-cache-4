25|$|India's tour of Australia in 1980–81 had <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the {{familiar}} Indian series as India were 1–0 down and were defending a meagre 143 runs and Kapil Dev virtually ruled {{out with a}} groin injury. When Australia finished the fourth day at 18/3, Kapil willed himself to play the final day with pain-killing injections and removed the dangerous Australia middle order. Kapil won the match for India with the innings bowling performance of 16.4–4–28–5, a bowling performance that figures in his five best bowling performance. During the Australian tour, he scored his first fifty in ODIs against New Zealand at Brisbane. Somehow India's Test cricket sensation was unable to adjust to ODI cricket and had a career start of 278 runs (Average: 17.38) and 17 wickets after 16 ODI matches.|$|E

In June 2005, he {{was cast in}} his most prominent role so far, that of teenage MI6 spy Alex Rider in the film Stormbreaker, {{based on the novel}} by Anthony Horowitz. He was one of 500 who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer chose to appear in the film over a role in the film Eragon, noting that he preferred Stormbreaker because it would be filmed in Britain, in the Isle of Man, while Eragon would film in Hungary; Pettyfer is afraid of flying, and he liked <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the cast for Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker was released on 21 July 2006 in the United Kingdom, on 6 October 2006 in the United States and on 21 September 2006 in Australia.|$|E

Von Dutch was as famous for his [...] "flying eyeball" [...] as he was for his intricate spider-web designs. As the decade began, hand-drawn pin striping was almost unheard of, but by 1958 it had become a popular method of customizing <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the hot rod.

500|$|Characterized by his [...] "raspy and strong" [...] {{voice and}} charismatic on-stage performances, Bueno became an instant {{success on the}} Argentine musical scene.

He wore fitted shirts with jeans and cowboy boots. He {{was known for his}} mixture of facial gestures and poses that accompanied his bravado image. Bueno was heavily involved with the creative process of his act.

He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced with Nagaraja Rao, a still photographer shooting some stills of Nageswara Rao in {{the guise}} of Devadasu, with a glass in his hand and <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> a drunkard. Rao also took shots of Savitri in Parvati's make-up in Naarsu's Studio. Impressed with these stills, Narayana decided to use the same make-up for the real shooting of the film. He showed these make-up stills to Mangaiah, the make-up man, who followed the same. Nageswara Rao, who portrayed the titular character, later recalled that Vedantam, being a Kuchipudi dance exponent and an experienced stage actor, used to enact the scenes before the actors, thereby making their job easy. He even recalled that that the director shot him only at night so that he could give the character a [...] "drunken, droopy" [...] look. Those night-time shots were filmed over 50 days.

500|$|Ellet had <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> an actor, {{which were}} complemented by his {{entertaining}} oratorical skills. [...] He {{took advantage of}} these characteristics, and used showmanship and dramatics to market his proposals. [...] These skills helped to win him attention and raise his profile both in the public and within the industry. [...] However, his imperiousness also ruffled the feathers of people, which caused conflicts. [...] Nonetheless, his capability to promote himself had won him the contracts for the Suspension Bridge and the later Wheeling Suspension Bridge; the Wheeling contract was won in July 1847 while Ellet's plan for the Niagara Suspension Bridge was still in its initial stages of construction. [...] Ellet's initial design for the bridge at Niagara placed all forms of transportation on a single deck. [...] The railway track {{was in the middle}} of the deck, sandwiched between carriageways and footpaths on the outer sides. [...] Moreover, trains would not go over the bridge; their cars would be disconnected from the heavy locomotives and pulled across the bridge by horses, cables, or lighter [...] engines. [...] Before the work could begin, Ellet faced the problem of all suspension bridge construction: getting a line across the gap.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine noted, [...] "It's [...] {{being called}} her most {{personal}} work to date, and from <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> it, that assessment isn't too far off." [...] Writing for The Wrap, Chris Willman compared the album with the American documentary show This Is Your Life. Willman also {{commented that the}} album was [...] "highly impressive, and almost all a little annoying, if solipsism isn't your thing" [...] and that [...] "even at her most egotistical, she's [...] strangely never less than utterly likeable. She might actually be the world's most good-natured megalomaniac." [...] He also called Beyoncé [...] "fairly glorious" [...] and noted that [...] "the live versions of the '4' material are more invigorating than the studio equivalents, with Beyoncé's eight-piece all-female band making everything sound like the great cross-pollination of contemporary urban and '70s soul you'd hope for." [...] Praising Beyoncé's [...] "animal magnetism" [...] during the performances of the songs, Simon Gage of Daily Express said that [...] "Beyoncé shines {{when it comes to}} performing". Chuck Arnold of People magazine commented that the songs from 4 sound [...] "even better" [...] performed on the live album. Darryl Sterdan of the website Jam! said in his review, [...] "With her usual blend of divatastic majesty, girl-next-door intimacy and boundless energy, B... rewinds her career and performs her latest CD at a NYC ballroom." ...|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{inspired}} main antagonist {{characters in}} the otherwise unrelated titles, such as the stepmother queen in the Russian animated film The Wild Swans (1962), the Witch Queen in the Spanish film Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood (1962), the goddess Venus in the anime version of Unico, Queen Admira in the American film The Hugga Bunch (1985), and {{the queen of the}} witches in the video game Curse of Enchantia (1992). Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth resembles the Queen in her costume, make-up, and even the manner of her death; Lady Macbeth was also visually based on the Queen in a 1982 comic book adaptation. The evil Queen Bavmorda from 1988's film Willow bears a resemblance too, so much that Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke described her as [...] "simply Snow Whites Wicked Queen, right down to her hooded costume." [...] Robin Wood has drawn a connection between <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the Witch and of the Emperor in the Star Wars franchise (which eventually also became a Disney property). According to the designer Steve Brown, the Queen's old Witch form served as an inspiration for the main character Witch Queen in his 1985 video game Cauldron. Brigitte Nielsen said she has also based her role as the Black Witch (who also kidnaps a prince character out of jealously for a princess) in the 1992 Italian film Fantaghirò 2 on Disney's [...] "Grimilde" [...] (an Italian name for the Queen in the comics).|$|E
500|$|The Washington Blade, {{originally}} called The Gay Blade, published {{its first}} issue on October 5, 1969. Taking its roots from the Mattachine Society of Washington's newsletter {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the Blade was conceived {{as a way to}} fill in a perceived gap in the organization of social communications within the gay community of Washington, D.C. The Blade was originally published as a single page and distributed hand-to-hand in a variety of gay bars throughout the city. Afraid of a backlash over the publication, many of the initial authors of writings in the Blade used pen names {{during the early years of}} publishing. The initial publications were entirely created by volunteers from the community with two editors, Nancy Tucker and Bart Wenger, at the helm. Wenger stated the initial goals of the publication were to [...] "...engender a sense of community" [...] and that it was [...] "very important for gays to become acquainted with one another." [...] Published monthly from 1969 to 1973, the newspaper evolved from its original size and shape of a single letter sized paper sheet. In June 1972, the Gay Blade published its first multi-page edition which consisted of four pages and in April 1973, the paper expanded to eight pages and was printed on legal sized paper sheets, stapled in the middle and folded. As <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the paper evolved, so did the news coverage. The Gay Blade began to focus less on being a newsletter used to organize the community and more of a newspaper for the community.|$|E
