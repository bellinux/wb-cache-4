The Met's chairman and three other directors were {{on the board of}} the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.|$|E
5|$|Vrba {{is clear}} that warning the Hungarian {{community}} {{was one of the}} motives for his escape. He wrote that in January 1944 a Polish kapo told him that a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive at Auschwitz, and that a new railway line was being built to accommodate them. He also overheard SS guards discuss how <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be eating Hungarian salami.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E
50|$|After {{borrowing}} money from Weber's father, the group recorded a five-song demo in Hollywood in 1984. After playing {{a number of}} more shows, Rose fired Weber from the band with former Road Crew guitarist Slash joining the group. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> disband <b>soon</b> after.|$|R

60|$|But <b>would</b> <b>they</b> do thus if {{they knew}} the {{severity}} of the law? <b>they</b> <b>would</b> as <b>soon</b> eat fire. The severity of the law would be an intolerable, insupportable burden to their consciences; it would drive them, and make them fly for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before them.|$|R
5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> have more water.|$|E
5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, the West Pier Trust {{remained}} {{adamant that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> begin full restoration work. Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring the pier, saying he could {{raise the money}} himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would not be going ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The pier was partially demolished in February 2010, partly {{to make way for}} the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts rescued from the pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of the pier collapsed in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to extend}} west and then south from Paddington to South Kensington and east from Moorgate to Tower Hill were {{accepted}} and received Royal Assent on 29 July 1864. To complete the circuit, the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two schemes proposed to run via different routes between Kensington and the City and a combined proposal {{under the name}} Metropolitan District Railway was agreed on the same day. Initially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were {{on the board of}} the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire {{conquered the}} Qara Khitai {{in the years}} 1216–1218 AD. Prior to the invasion, war with the Khwarazmian dynasty and the {{usurpation}} of power by the Naiman prince Kuchlug had weakened the Qara Khitai. When Kuchlug besieged Almaliq, a city belonging to the Karluks, vassals of the Mongol Empire, Genghis Khan dispatched a force under command of Jebe to pursue Kuchlug. After his force of 30,000 was defeated by Jebe at the Khitan capital Balasagun, Kuchlug faced rebellions over his unpopular rule, forcing him to flee to modern Afghanistan, where he was captured by hunters in 1218. The hunters turned Kuchlug over to the Mongols, who beheaded him. Upon defeating the Qara Khitai, the Mongols now had a direct border with the Khwarazmian Empire, which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> invade in 1219.|$|E
60|$|People {{thought the}} world moved slower; at all events, <b>they</b> hoped it <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> do so. Even the wiser revolutionists {{postponed}} their outbreaks. Success, they believed, was fain to smile upon effort {{which had been}} well postponed.|$|R

60|$|But Dick had {{not left}} {{them to take}} their chance in that way. He had warned Mary long ago how to act in such circumstances, and she soon {{returned}} to March {{with the news that}} there were four Indian warriors outside, examining the bush behind which the head had disappeared, and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> very <b>soon</b> find out the cave.|$|R
5|$|The crusaders {{may have}} {{expected}} Alexios to become their leader, {{but he had}} no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear fealty to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> encounter.|$|E
5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be executed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{were the}} first to pioneer the assault rifle concept, during World War II, based upon {{research}} that showed that most firefights happen within 400 meters and that contemporary rifles were over-powered for most small arms combat. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> develop a select-fire intermediate powered rifle combining the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1984 the LBO was a target for virulent {{criticism}} by Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, by John S.R. Shad, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and other senior financiers. The gist of all the denunciations was that top-heavy reversed pyramids of debt were being created and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> crash, destroying assets and jobs.|$|E
25|$|Shahumyan {{was under}} the {{impression}} that the Bolsheviks <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be sending reinforcements from the Caspian Sea to assist him although the prospects of receiving such relief remained unlikely. He had sent numerous telegrams to Moscow extolling the fighting abilities of his Armenian units but warned that <b>they</b> too, <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be unable to halt the advance of Enver's army. With this, MacDonell's and Shahumyan's conversation ended with the possibility of accepting British aid in exchange for complete Bolshevik control over the military force, terms the British could not immediately accept.|$|R

25|$|There {{were many}} motives behind Khosrow's strike against the Byzantines during their Eternal Peace. Emissaries from the Ostrogoth kingdom {{in the west}} appealed to Khosrow to put {{pressure}} on the eastern front of East Rome. Gothic envoys spoke to Khosrow's court and spoke of Justinian's goal to unite the world under Roman rule. The Gothic envoys persuasively informed Khosrow that if Persia did not act soon, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> become victims of Byzantine aggression.|$|E

25|$|Their {{different}} personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice {{provided an opportunity}} to socialise while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he {{made a point of}} drawing the Ca' d'Oro and the Palazzo Ducale (Doge’s Palace), because he feared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>soon</b> be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of the troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.|$|E
