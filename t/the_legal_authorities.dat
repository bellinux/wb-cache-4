5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E

It {{has been said that}} these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.|$|E
25|$|The answer, he said, would largely {{depend on}} the way in which {{sovereignty}} was said to have been acquired. He observed that although <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|E

Nevertheless, his denials were accepted by the government's principal law officers and the Conservative Chief Whip, although with some private scepticism. [...] Macmillan, mindful of the injustice done to Galbraith on the basis of rumours, was determined to support his minister, and took no action.|$|E
500|$|As {{established}} by the Constitution of Australia, the Parliament of Australia is composed of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate, together with the Queen. The monarch is represented through the Governor-General, who has executive powers granted in the Constitution, as well as rarely exercised reserve powers. The reserve powers are <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> remaining in the Crown after most of its historic powers were transferred to Parliament or to officials. The Governor-General ordinarily acts only upon {{the advice of the}} government, but can act independently and against advice in exercising the reserve powers. The Governor-General is removable by the Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. As Liberal Party leader Malcolm Fraser, who would play a large part in the crisis, put it, [...] "The Queen has tenure, and she couldn't be sacked. But a Governor-General holds office at pleasure, and if he ceases to please then he can be removed by a Prime Minister." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{early modern}} period also saw fear of Satanists reach its [...] "historical apogee" [...] {{in the form}} of the witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. This came about as the accusations which had been {{levelled}} at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of the witch, or practitioner of malevolent magic. The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief and folkloric ideas about the night witch, the wild hunt, and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it. The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain's North American colonies, being carried out by <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> in both Catholic and Protestant regions.|$|E

In 1996 the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil held a special solemn session to honor Ruhiyyih Khanum, who was visiting Brazil to commemorate the 75th anniversary of {{the establishment of the}} Bahá'í Faith in Brazil. In 2000 Brazil agreed to take in 30 families facing religious persecution in their native Iran. National Justice Secretary Elizabeth Sussekind said that the resettlement was part of an agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Since the initial arrest of members of the leadership of the Bahá'ís in Iran in March 2008 Brazilian Congressmen have been speaking out: Luiz Couto - 13 March, Fernando Ferro - 8 April, Luiz Couto again - 3 July, Boy Alencar - 13 August, Bullet Rocha - 13 August, Luiz Couto again - 8 October, Geraldo Resende - 16 October and Pompeo de Mattos and Carlos Abicalil November 19.

Otherwise, the news of what had happened would get abroad in the village, and might come to her ears, in the worst possible way, through one of the servants. To my infinite relief, Mr. Finch, when I rose to go, excused himself from accompanying me. He had discovered that it was his duty, as rector, to give the earliest information of the outrage at Browndown to <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities.</b> He went his way to the nearest magistrate.

6000|$|Mankind {{can hardly}} be too often {{reminded}} that {{there was once a}} man named Socrates, between whom and <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authorities</b> and public opinion of his time, there took place a memorable collision. Born in an age and country abounding in individual greatness, this man has been handed down to us by those who best knew both him and the age, as the most virtuous man in it; while we know him as the head and prototype of all subsequent teachers of virtue, the source equally of the lofty inspiration of Plato and the judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, [...] "i maëstri di color che sanno," [...] the two headsprings of ethical as of all other philosophy. This acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers who have since lived--whose fame, still growing after more than two thousand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names which make his native city illustrious--was put to death by his countrymen, after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality. Impiety, in denying the gods recognised by the State; indeed his accuser asserted (see the [...] "Apologia") that he believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in being, by his doctrines and instructions, a [...] "corruptor of youth." [...] Of these charges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing, honestly found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all then born had deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a criminal.|$|E

Where the deuce do we get it? We get it from the landlady's brother, who has a horse and chaise which he lets out for hire.

Good again. Once on the highroad, what do we do? Drive to the first station beyond York, northward, southward, or eastward, as may be hereafter determined. No lawyer's clerk is waiting for you there. You and Mrs. Wragge get out--first opening the hamper at a convenient opportunity. Instead of containing chickens and Champagne, it contains a carpet-bag, with the things you want for the night. You take your tickets for a place previously determined on, and I take the chaise back to York. Arrived once more in this house, I collect the luggage left behind, and send for the woman downstairs. 'Ladies so charmed with such and such a place (wrong place of course), that they have determined to stop there. Pray accept the customary week's rent, in place of a week's warning. Good day.'
