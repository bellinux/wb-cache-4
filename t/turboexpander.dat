2500|$|Ethane is most {{efficiently}} {{separated from}} methane by liquefying it at cryogenic temperatures. Various refrigeration strategies exist: the most economical process presently in wide use employs a <b>turboexpander,</b> and can recover more than 90% of the ethane in natural gas. In this process, chilled gas is expanded through a turbine, reducing the temperature to about [...] At this low temperature, gaseous methane can {{be separated from}} the liquefied ethane and heavier hydrocarbons by distillation. Further distillation then separates ethane from the propane and heavier hydrocarbons.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{operating}} conditions, the <b>turboexpander</b> reduces the load on the electric motor by some 6 to 15% as compared to a conventional vapor-compression refrigeration system that uses a throttling expansion valve rather than a <b>turboexpander.</b> Basically, {{this can be seen}} as a form of turbo compounding.|$|E

50|$|In 1939, the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitsa {{perfected the}} design of centrifugal <b>turboexpanders.</b> His first practical prototype was made of Monel metal, had an outside diameter of only 8 cm (3.1 in), operated at 40,000 revolutions per minute and expanded 1,000 cubic metres of air per hour. It used a water pump as a brake and had an efficiency of 79 to 83 percent. Most <b>turboexpanders</b> in industrial use since then {{have been based on}} Kapitsa's design and centrifugal <b>turboexpanders</b> have taken over almost 100 percent of the industrial gas liquefaction and low temperature process requirements.
