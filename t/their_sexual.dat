40|$|The use {{of condoms}} is very {{important}} for the prevention of sexually transmissible infections and unwanted pregnancies. The prevalence of condom use for <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> intercourse was unknown among students from the City of Santa Marta, Colombia. Objective: To determine the prevalence of condom use at <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> relationship among adolescent students at the City of Santa Marta. Method: A survey about sexual behavior was applied. Two hundred twenty three subjects, 13 to 17 years of age reported sexual intercourse, 46 girls and 177 boys. Multivariate analysis was done with gender stratification. Results: The prevalence of condom use at <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> intercourse was 38. 6 % (95 %CI 35. 3 - 41. 9); not difference for male gender was found (PR 0. 75, 95 %CI 0. 47 - 1. 20). Among male, being older at time of <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> relationship (OR 0. 57, 95 %CI 0. 42 - 0. 75) and studying at private schoosl (OR 0. 34, 95 %CI 0. 16 - 0. 71) was {{associated with the use of}} condom at <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> intercourse. But, for girls no variable was related to the use of condom at <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> intercourse. Conclusions: About of one out of three students used condom at <b>their</b> first <b>sexual</b> intercourse. For boys, being older at time of their first relationship and studying at private school was a protective factor; instead for girls all investigated variables were not related among them. Further investigations are needed in this subject, due to the impact of the {{use of condoms}} among adolescents as it has implications in public health...|$|R
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> maturity has varied to a lesser extent then the male population across the years.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Torchwood is a British {{science fiction}} drama {{television}} programme, {{part of the}} long-running Doctor Who franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes.

50|$|The sister {{effect is}} an {{exception}} to male overperception bias. Haselton and Buss (2000) found that sexual overperception bias would not occur when the target the men had to perceive sexual intent from was their sister. They found that the men's perception of <b>their</b> sister's <b>sexual</b> intent was lower than <b>their</b> perception of <b>sexual</b> intent from other females. Haselton and Buss (2000) believed that this perception of female sexual interest was most accurate as it fell between women's perception of women (high interest) and women's perception of <b>their</b> own <b>sexual</b> interest (low interest). This could be a product of incest-avoidance mechanisms.|$|R

5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E
5|$|Women who {{identify}} as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women {{who identify}} as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death.

Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E

5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson.

Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> expectations.|$|E

5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it.

5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways.

Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease.

Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
