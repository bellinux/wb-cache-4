In this paper, the gain-characteristics of the transmission from <b>cones</b> <b>to</b> horizontal cells and from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> are determined with and without negative feedback from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones.</b> It is shown that 1) the gain-characteristic from <b>cones</b> <b>to</b> horizontal cells is strongly nonlinear without feedback from horizontal cells, 2) the gain-characteristic between cones and horizontal cells becomes linear when feedback is active, and 3) horizontal cells feed back <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> via a linear mechanism.

40|$|Photoreceptors are {{the light}} {{sensitive}} {{cells in the}} retina. They project to horizontal cells and bipolar cells via a glutamatergic feed forward pathway. Horizontal cells are strongly electrically coupled and integrate in that way the input from the photoreceptors. Horizontal cells feedback <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> negatively. The combined signal from the photoreceptors and the horizontal cells {{is sent to the}} bipolar cells. The feedback pathway from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> is thought <b>to</b> form the basis for the center/surround organization of bipolar cells. The nature of the feedback pathway is an issue of intense debate. It was thought {{for a long time that}} this feedback pathway was GABAergic, because cones have GABA-receptors and horizontal cells release GABA via a GABA-transporter working in the reversed direction. However, recently we showed in goldfish that horizontal cells feed back <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> via an alternative mechanism. In goldfish, negative feedback from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> shifts the calcium current of the <b>cone</b> <b>to</b> more negative potentials. This feedback pathway is independent of GABA, since feedback cannot be blocked by either saturating concentrations of PTX, the GABA-transporter blocker SKF 89976 A, or application of GABA. The mechanism of negative feedback from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> involves hemichannels located at the tips of the invaginating horizontal cells, just opposite to the calcium channels of the cones. Current flowing through these hemichannels changes the extracellular potential deep in the synaptic cleft and in that way modulates the calcium current of the cones. Such a modulation of the extracellular potential is called ephaptic. If negative feedback from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> is indeed ephaptic, other channels present in the synapse should also be able to act as a current source, i. e., should also be able to change the output of the cone. We showed that glutamate-gated channels present at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites can also mediate feedback responses. Surprisingly, although the glutamate-gated conductance of the horizontal cells is eight times the hemichannel conductance, glutamate-gated channels are not the major current source in negative feedback from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones.</b> In this chapter we present evidence that this is due to the more focal localization of the hemichannels, compared to a diffuse and extrasynaptic localization of the glutamate-gated channel...|$|R

40|$|Cones in the {{vertebrate}} retina {{project to}} horizontal and bipolar cells and the horizontal cells feedback negatively <b>to</b> <b>cones.</b> This organization {{forms the basis}} for the center/surround organization of the bipolar cells, a fundamental step in the visual signal processing. Although the surround responses of bipolar cells have been recorded on many occasions, surprisingly, the underlying surround-induced responses in cones are not easily detected. In this paper, the nature of the surround-induced responses in cones is studied. Horizontal cells feed back <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> by shifting the activation function of the calcium current in <b>cones</b> <b>to</b> more negative potentials. This shift increases the calcium influx, which increases the neurotransmitter release of the cone. In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, in addition to this increase of neurotransmitter release, a calcium-dependent chloride current will be activated, which polarizes the cone membrane potential. The question is, whether the modulation of the calcium current or the polarization of the cone membrane potential is the major determinant for feedback-mediated responses in second-order neurons. Depolarizing light responses of biphasic horizontal cells are generated by feedback from monophasic horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones.</b> It was found that niflumic acid blocks the feedback-induced depolarizing responses in cones, while the shift of the calcium current activation function and the depolarizing biphasic horizontal cell responses remain intact. This shows that horizontal cells can feed back <b>to</b> <b>cones,</b> without inducing major changes in the cone membrane potential. This makes the feedback synapse from horizontal cells <b>to</b> <b>cones</b> a unique synapse. Polarization of the presynaptic (horizontal) cell leads to calcium influx in the postsynaptic cell (<b>cone),</b> but due <b>to</b> the combined activity of the calcium current and the calcium-dependent chloride current, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell will be hardly modulated, whereas the output of the postsynaptic cell will be strongly modulated. Since no polarization of the postsynaptic cell is needed for these feedback-mediated responses, this mechanism of synaptic transmission can modulate the neurotransmitter release in single synaptic terminals without affecting the membrane potential of the entire cel...|$|R
