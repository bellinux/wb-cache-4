5|$|On March 17, Booth learned <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> {{would be}} {{attending}} {{a performance of}} the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home {{in the attempt to}} kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear. Booth later learned <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where, coincidentally, Booth was then staying.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{lived in}} Indiana from 1816 until 1830, age 7 to 21. It was {{during these years}} <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> first {{encountered}} slavery and began to form his opinions.

5|$|The {{previous}} day, Booth was in {{the crowd}} outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. Lincoln stated {{that he was in}} favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves, and Booth declared that it would be the last speech <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> would ever make.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ford's Theatre {{around noon}} {{to pick up}} his mail, Booth learned <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This {{provided}} him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familial to its staff.|$|E
5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouriâ€”the only state Seward campaigned in <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E

5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{stronghold of}} Vicksburg, Mississippi blocked {{the way for}} {{complete}} Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital for the Union War effort. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured Holly Springs Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20 broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant's and Sherman's armies from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman. During this time Grant incorporated fleeing African American slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and paid employment.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E

5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was elected}} {{president}} on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding {{portion of the population}} favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53â€“13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union, while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C. vulnerable and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention, so Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney in Ex parte Merryman that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> was homosexual or bisexual note <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> {{married and had}} four children.

25|$|In the debates, Douglas reiterated {{his support}} of popular sovereignty. He demanded to know whether Lincoln would ever vote to admit a new slave state, even if the {{majority}} of settlers favored slavery. He denounced Lincoln for his insistence that slavery was a moral issue {{that had to be}} resolved by the nation as a whole. Douglas described this as causing an unnecessary conflict between free and slave states, which threatened to boil up into disunion and war. He also asserted <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> supported civil and social equality between the races, and insinuated <b>that</b> <b>Lincoln</b> even accepted interracial marriage.|$|E
25|$|Substantively, the Howard {{article was}} a direct assault on Lincoln's manliness.
