5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages.

When such a grant was made {{for the maintenance of}} temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers killed in <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> regarding the high cost, {{and that the}} roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or {{as a result of}} criminal acts, rather than all officers killed in the line of duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E

After his son's death, Doggett's marriage to Barbara Doggett (played by Patrick's real-life wife Barbara) ended in divorce.|$|E
6000|$|At his demise, in December 1851, {{the value}} of his estate was, I [...] think, near £600,000. My father was a {{successful}} merchant, but [...] considering his long life and means of accumulation, the result [...] represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others [...] whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed. It was a large [...] and strong nature, simple though hasty, profoundly affectionate and [...] capable of the highest devotion in <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> and <b>of</b> love. I [...] think that his intellect was a little intemperate, though not his [...] character. In his old age, spent mainly in retirement, he was our [...] constant [centre of] social and domestic life.
