5|$|In January 2007, it was {{claimed that}} as many as 10,000 {{visitors}} passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel is the biggest attraction. The Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.|$|E
5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} station. This {{portion of}} the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E

50|$|Born <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> an {{ornamental}} plasterer in the Charing Cross area of London, {{his father}} had sculpted <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Foundling Hospital there. His father wished {{him to be a}} civil engineer but he strongly desired to be a sculptor.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Sandrino dall’ Impruneta. He {{began his career as}} an {{assistant}} to Alessandro Allori. Allori led the team between 1587 and 1591, including Pieroni, Giovanni Bizelli, Giovanni Maria Butteri, and a young Cigoli in decorating <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uffizi in Florence.|$|R
5|$|The European Parliament seat {{remained}} an issue throughout this period, despite the Council writing {{it into the}} treaties. During the 1990s, the issue was debated every year and in 1999, 250 MEPs signed a letter condemning the arrangement and the Strasbourg facilities. The following year Parliament voted 401 to 77 for a resolution demanding {{the right to decide}} its own working locations. Attempts to include this in the following treaties in 2000 and 2007 both failed. However, in September 2008 Parliament held its first full plenary session in Brussels after <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Strasbourg chamber collapsed during recess forcing the temporary move.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
50|$|Frescos which adorned <b>the</b> apse <b>of</b> Södra Åsum {{church and}} <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> churches in Everlöv and Illstrop centuries ago have been slowly {{uncovered}} in recent years. Many similar churches had their ornamentation stripped and their paintings plastered over as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iconoclasm <b>of</b> Sweden's adoption of Lutheranism.|$|R
50|$|He {{painted in}} {{conjunction}} with Morandi, Bonatti, and Romanelli; and executed an altar-piece in oil, and <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapels in fresco, for <b>the</b> church <b>of</b> Santa Maria dell' Anima in Rome. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings by him in Liege were destroyed when the French bombarded that town in 1691.|$|R
50|$|Built in {{the late}} Baroque style, the castle {{featured}} over 30 rooms and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest examples <b>of</b> trompe-l'œil, particularly in the Grand Stair Hall. This and <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaisersaal (Emperor Hall) and the Weißersaal (White Hall) were painted by Adam Friedrich Oeser, whom the Count commissioned in 1756.|$|R
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; {{the price of oil}} and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the front of the house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brew-house below.|$|E
25|$|The frescoes adorning <b>the</b> {{walls and}} <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave were painted by Vatican painter and artist in {{residence}} Luigi Gregori. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{are filled with}} a starry sky with angels, while the walls and transept are decorated with figures of saints. Gregori also painted <b>the</b> stations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross that decorate <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main nave.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{two towers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate is a {{powerful}} block with a large portal and an open room upstairs. <b>The</b> two portals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers were used for freight transport. The monumental gate in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Propylaea was reserved for riders and city cars. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers were coffered.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burial {{chambers}} were decorated (from <b>the</b> burial <b>of</b> Seti I onwards) {{with what}} became [...] formalised as <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heavens, which again describes the sun's journey through <b>the</b> twelve hours <b>of</b> night. Again from Seti I's time, <b>the</b> Litany <b>of</b> Re, a lengthy hymn {{to the sun}} god began to appear.|$|R
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, {{in association with the}} Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel {{was to have}} a {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, {{it was originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is {{the only part of}} the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E
50|$|Chiktan Castle {{is located}} deep inside a valley, by the Indus river, with the {{mountains}} in the background. It is composed of rammed earth and stone masonry with mud mortar. Following <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> architect and carpenter Shinkhen Chandan, the castle used timber to support <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure {{as well as to}} frame the doors and windows.|$|R
2500|$|In 1758, {{the newly}} {{completed}} palazzo was enhanced further, by <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> frescos to <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state {{rooms on the}} piano nobile overlooking the rio di San Barnaba. [...] The artists selected for this task were Jacopo Guarana, Gaspare Diziani and most importantly Giambattista Tiepolo. [...] These frescos remaining today are among the finest preserved in Venice.|$|R

5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
5|$|In the Padma Purana, {{the curse}} of the sages fails. In retribution, Shiva casts a curse on the sages so that they, like Bhikshatana, will become beggars with matted hair and be devoid of knowledge. Those who would still worship him would gain knowledge, wealth, and progeny, and be reborn into good families. In the Skanda Purana, the sages of the Deodar Forest are {{performing}} rituals and start {{to think of themselves as}} gods. To humble these arrogant sages, Shiva takes the form of Bhikshatana—an attractive young beggar—and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, the women wildly chase Shiva. When the sages regain their senses, they perform a black magic sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger), and a dwarf, all of which attack Shiva, who overpowers them. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer. The same legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some differences. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shivakamasundari shrine in the Nataraja temple complex illustrates this legend in a series of frescos, where Bhikshatana is depicted as a white naked mendicant accompanied by a scantily-scad Mohini.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{drawing room}} and library {{are the most}} {{elaborate}} in the house. The plaster frieze in the library also displays fine workmanship; [...] wide, it is designed in a striking arabesque pattern, with an evident Florentine influence. In the 1880s the library had a collection of 5,000 volumes, about half <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> books <b>the</b> Cope family owned at the time.|$|R

25|$|A {{painting}} from this ship survives on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners House Chatham Dockyard, over the grand staircase. It depicts an assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods and depicts Mars being crowned by Neptune, {{surrounded by the}} goddesses - Hope, Peace, Justice and Plenty. The painting {{is surrounded by a}} gilded frieze depicting sea creatures. It is attributed to James Thornhill - Sargeant Painter. He painted <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Hospital Greenwich and <b>the</b> Dome <b>of</b> Saint Paul's Cathedral.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ {{on the right side}} and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{inspired}} by {{his visit to the}} Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood cutout figures appearing to hold up <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
