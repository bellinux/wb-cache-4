5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had {{become more of a}} sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|The Carbon, Puyallup, Mowich, Nisqually, and Cowlitz Rivers {{begin at}} eponymous glaciers of Mount Rainier. <b>The</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White River are Winthrop, Emmons, and Fryingpan Glaciers.

5|$|The {{coronation}} of Æthelstan {{took place}} on 4 September 925 at Kingston upon Thames, perhaps due to its symbolic location {{on the border between}} Wessex and Mercia. He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm, who probably designed or organised a new ordo (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet. The new ordo was influenced by West Frankish liturgy and in turn became one of <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval French ordo.|$|E

50|$|However, this {{decision}} created another issue {{as to which}} river is <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa.

5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups.

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complaint.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius married Vipsania Agrippina, the {{daughter}} of Augustus’s close friend and greatest general, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. He {{was appointed to the}} position of praetor, and sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in Gallia Narbonensis and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the Alps and within Transalpine Gaul, conquering Raetia. In 15BC he discovered <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube, and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course. Returning to Rome in 13BC, Tiberius was appointed as consul, and around this same time his son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born.|$|E
5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along {{with a discussion of}} <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work and a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer, and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two {{illustrations}} of Sydney Cove and the Aboriginal group are not known. The ceramic colouring bears a general resemblance to contemporary Sydney Cove images which implies that an original watercolour or hand coloured engraving {{was used for}} copying rather than black and white images. In {{the case of the}} Library punchbowl, the depiction of Sydney Cove is most likely done from an engraving after a now lost drawing by Lewin, which may date to 1814. This Sydney Cove engraving appeared as a full-page illustration in the second edition of A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of New South Wales and its dependent settlements in Van Diemen's Land etc (London, 1820) by Wentworth, with a later, smaller, version as one of ten Port Jackson harbour views illustrated on Map of Part of New South Wales (London, 1825) by publisher and engraver, Joseph Cross. As Australia's first professional artist, Lewin produced many paintings for Macquarie and his senior officers. He also made a number of commissions for Riley. Lewin had a close association with Antill and both were part of Governor Macquarie's 50-strong excursion party to inspect land and the new road over the Blue Mountains from 25April to 19May 1815. The road had been built by convicts in 1814, after the first European crossing by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and Wentworth in May 1813.|$|E
50|$|The {{claim that}} Thames Head is <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Thames is disputed. The Environment Agency, the Ordnance Survey and other {{authorities}} have <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames as the nearby Trewsbury Mead. Others hold that <b>the</b> true <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames is at Seven Springs, Gloucestershire, some 11 mi further north, {{and east of}} Gloucester. Seven Springs is officially <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Churn, which is itself a tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames that joins at Cricklade. As it lies further from <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames than Trewsbury Mead, <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> Seven Springs as its <b>source</b> would make <b>the</b> Thames the longest river in the UK.|$|R

This was facilitated by Assyria’s weak position in the 8th century BC. Urartu continued to resist Assyrian attacks and reached it greatest extent under Argishti I (c. 785–760 BC).
