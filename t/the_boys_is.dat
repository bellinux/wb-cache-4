The next morning, Mulder and Scully find {{a book on}} Jewish mysticism buried with Isaac's body; it mysteriously bursts into flames. On the book is Jacob's name. The agents search for Jacob, finding him in a synagogue with the hanged body of the last remaining boy. Although Jacob admits to both of the murders, Mulder believes that a Golem—a creature from Jewish mysticism—is the true murderer.|$|E

The next day, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) leads an {{investigation}} of U.N. troops of the area. She runs into Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), who has caught Dimitri, the other Kazakh boy. Krycek tells Marita to tell her superiors that [...] "it is all going to hell".|$|E

500|$|The Radioactive Man {{commercial}} for Laramie cigarettes that Bart and Lisa watch {{at the convention}} is a takeoff of The Flintstones starring in Winston cigarette television commercials which aired during the 1960s. When Bart begs Mrs. Glick not to apply iodine to his wounded arm, she grabs his arm and the scene shifts to their silhouettes as Bart screams, mirroring a scene in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind.

500|$|While Perry's music {{incorporates}} pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve {{themes of}} sex and love. One of <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> <b>is</b> a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences. Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a [...] "360-degree liberation" [...] record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity. Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as [...] "irresistible hook-laden melodies". Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.|$|E
500|$|The {{other boys}} carry out equally barbaric acts: {{the two boys}} {{at the top of}} the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the {{foreground}} are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two [...] is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the biblical}} version, {{the two women}} are {{identified}} as prostitutes, as opposed to some Indian versions {{in which they are}} widows of one husband. Some scholars have inferred from this difference as to the origin of the story. Gressmann makes a comparison between the Hebrew story and one of the Indian parallels and arrives at the conclusion that the Indian story is more original. He argues that in the Hebrew story the reason for the exchanging of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> unmotivated, while in the Indian story this is comprehensible, taking into account the Indian law which states that a childless widow does not take part in the husband inheritance. Gressmann speculates that the story had arrived to ancient Israel with the mediation of the kingdom of Sheba, which according to the Book of Kings was in contact with Israel in the time of Solomon. A similar opinion is held by Gunkel, who points out that the designation of the women as prostitutes in the biblical story decreases the story's coherence, because it is difficult to understand why a prostitute, who can barely raise her own son, would want to steal another woman's baby. On the other hand, ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking forward to getting up to Sydney. It's a great footy club and, as I said, I had to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> something very tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E
