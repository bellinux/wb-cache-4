5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E
5|$|Stichometry {{existed for}} several reasons. Scribes were {{paid by the}} line and their fee per line was {{sometimes}} fixed by legal decree. Authors occasionally cited passages {{in the works of}} other authors by giving their approximate line number. Book buyers used total line counts <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> copied texts were complete. Library catalogs listed the total number of lines in each work along with the title and author.|$|E
5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations will be required <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will {{be closer to the}} Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E

50|$|The {{prison is}} {{operated}} {{to a contract}} between Serco and the Scottish Prison Service. This contract has a system of 44 performance measures, ranging from ensuring that prisoner's visitors are not unduly delayed on entrance <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>that</b> appropriate levels of purposeful activities are provided to inmates.|$|R

5000|$|Under this ordering, the {{positive}} integers become a lattice with meet {{given by the}} gcd and join given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>that</b> lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a duality between them: ...|$|R

25|$|In ZFC, one {{proves that}} these notions all {{generate}} or apply to sets via the ZFC axioms of union, separation, and power set. In NFU, {{it is easy}} <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> these definitions give rise to stratified formulas.|$|E

25|$|The MBTI {{has been}} {{successfully}} translated and adapted into over 20 languages, including reviews by subject matter experts fluent in the native language, and statistical analysis <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> the questions still measure the same psychological concepts as the original US English questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|The second rule is what {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a skein relation. <b>To</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> these rules give an invariant of an oriented link, one should determine that the polynomial does not change under the three Reidemeister moves. Many important knot polynomials can be defined in this way.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} the ancients treated the {{parallel}} postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.|$|E

Ali {{was taken}} to hospital immediately after the fight <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> his severely swollen right side jaw (which was apparent in post-fight interviews) wasn't actually broken. Frazier also spent time in hospital during the ensuing month, the exertions of the fight having been exacerbated by hypertension and a kidney infection.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the three}} {{sides of the}} {{triangle}}s are open to direct experiment, as are the three angles, a class of tests of the Standard Model is <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> the triangle closes.

Since c0 g = g, uniqueness implies that σu = u and σp = p−1. Hence u lies in K and p in P0.|$|E
25|$|All that is {{demanded of}} private schools {{is that their}} {{teaching}} equal that of the municipal schools. The Ministry of Education confers on private schools {{the right to use}} the final examinations of the folkeskole, thereby exercising a certain extent of quality control. In principle, however, it is not up to any government authority but to the parents of each private school <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> its performance measures up to the demands set for the municipal schools.|$|E
25|$|If σ is real, then μ(σ) {{is defined}} {{to be the}} infimum of all real numbers a such that ζ(σ+iT) = O(T'a). It is trivial <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>that</b> μ(σ)=0 for σ>1, and the {{functional}} equation of the zeta function implies that μ(σ) = μ(1σ)σ+1/2. The Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem implies that μ is a convex function. The Lindelöf hypothesis states μ(1/2)=0, which together with the above properties of μ implies that μ(σ) is 0 for σ≥1/2 and 1/2σ for σ≤1/2.|$|E

Originally the bar codes scanned were based on standard 1D codes but to avoid mistakes 2D bar codes were introduced in 2004 so that each packaging type could hold a unique identity. <b>To</b> <b>checks</b> <b>that</b> the scanners are operational Autocoding solutions include two way communications with all hardware devices, or prevent the lines starting if links are not available.|$|R
