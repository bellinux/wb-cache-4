25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are not going to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E
500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Fermi {{calculations}} {{are often}} not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> look for {{to get a better}} answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago. [...] It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme reasonable values that could appear in each of our assumptions).|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two primary}} areas of media agenda-setting: (i) the media <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> {{the news and}} (ii) <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think about the news.

Additionally, news that is not given press coverage often dissipates, not only because it lacks a vehicle of mass communication, but because individuals may not express their concerns for fear of ostracization; this further creates the spiral of silence effect.|$|R
