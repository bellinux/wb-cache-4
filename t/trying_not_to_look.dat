60|$|The {{next day}} Teddy {{vanished}} Londonward on his bicycle. He {{was going to}} lodge in London {{in order to be}} near his training. He was zealous. Never before had Teddy been zealous. Mrs. Teddy came to the Dower House for the correspondence, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> self-conscious and important.|$|E
60|$|Honora was silent. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the group, {{in which}} there were two women of very {{attractive}} appearance, and another man.|$|R

"I endeavoured {{to do my}} duty, sir," [...] I answered, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Lucy, {{and seem}} meek; [...] "and {{it would have been}} a terrible disgrace to have come home, and been obliged to say the French got the ship from us, when we were all asleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Marshal signs his name, Mr. Ballington <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> indignant as {{he makes}} for the door. A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's desk, the one word: [...] "Spot!" [...] breaks the intense silence, which {{is one way of}} saying that Mr. Ballington is detained, and will {{probably}} be lodged that night at Government expense.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was their}} last night together. They {{faced each other}} in the manse-parlour at Wheens, whose low, peeled ceiling had {{threatened}} Mr. Eassie at his desk every time he looked up with his pen in his mouth until his wife died, when he ceased to notice things. The one picture on the walls, an engraving of a boy in velveteen, astride a tree, entitled [...] "Boyhood of Bunyan," [...] had started life with him. The horsehair chairs were not torn, and you did not require to know the sofa before you sat down on it, that day thirty years before, when a chubby minister and his lady walked to the manse between two cart-loads of furniture, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> elated.|$|E
6000|$|Hallam {{bowed and}} <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised. [...] "Very well. I {{have brought the}} {{document}} about which you wrote. I am sorry I find it impossible to renew the loan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Infinite! No {{one could}} be so welcome! How pleased Mr. Audley will be! But I must go, and <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> too much {{disposed}} {{to stand on the}} counter and crow.' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{opening of}} Parliament {{gave me some}} {{peculiar}} moods. I began to feel {{more and more like}} a branded sheep. We were sworn in in batches, dozens and scores of fresh men, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> too fresh under the inspection of policemen and messengers, all of us carrying new silk hats and wearing magisterial coats. It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of silk hats in the smoking-room of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought {{there must have been a}} funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under soft felt hats, under bowlers, under liberal-minded wide brims, and above artistic ties and tweed jackets, suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.|$|E
60|$|The {{detailed}} {{story of}} Mr. Britling's two days' search for some easy and convenient ladder {{into the service}} of his threatened country would be a voluminous one. It would begin with {{the figure of a}} neatly brushed patriot, with an intent expression upon his intelligent face, seated in the Londonward train, reading the war news--the first comforting war news for many days--and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as though his life was torn up by the roots and all his being aflame with devotion; and it would conclude after forty-eight hours of fuss, inquiry, talk, waiting, telephoning, with the same gentleman, a little fagged and with a kind of weary apathy in his eyes, returning by the short cut from the station across Claverings park to resume his connection with his abandoned roots. The essential process of the interval had been the correction of Mr. Britling's temporary delusion that the government of the British Empire is either intelligent, instructed, or wise.|$|E
6000|$|Biography and {{exploration}} were her favourite reading, for choice {{the biography of}} {{men who had been}} good to their mothers, and she liked the explorers to be alive so that she could shudder at the thought of their venturing forth again; but though she expressed a hope that they would have the sense to stay at home henceforth, she gleamed with admiration when they disappointed her. In later days I had a friend who was an African explorer, and she was in two minds about him; {{he was one of the}} most engrossing of mortals to her, she admired him prodigiously, pictured him at the head of his caravan, now attacked by savages, now by wild beasts, and adored him for the uneasy hours he gave her, but she was also afraid that he wanted to take me with him, and then she thought he should be put down by law. Explorers’ mothers also interested her very much; the books might tell her nothing about them, but she could create them for herself and wring her hands in sympathy with them when they had got no news of him for six months. Yet there were times when she grudged him to them—as the day when he returned victorious. Then what was before her eyes was not the son coming marching home again but an old woman peering for him round the window curtain and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> uplifted. The newspaper reports would be about the son, but my mother’s comment was ‘She’s a proud woman this night.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Nick <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> conscious, for {{he felt a}} {{significance}} in the old man's face. He turned his own everywhere but toward it, thinking again of his mother. [...] "That must be very pleasant, if one has any." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him; {{the very}} {{sight of him}} filled her with horror--that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy lips, that hideous bandage across his face that hid one of his eyes! She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see him and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hear him laugh.|$|R
6000|$|Marguerite <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Brogard, lest {{she should}} betray before him the burning anxiety {{with which she}} waited for his reply. But a free-born French citizen is never in any hurry to answer questions: Brogard took his time, then he said very slowly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the little}} {{minister}} {{looked out at}} the carriage window, many of the people drew back humbly, but a little boy in a red frock with black spots pressed forward and offered him a sticky parly, which Gavin accepted, though not without a tremor, for children were more terrible to him then than bearded men. The boy's mother, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> elated, bore him away, but her face said that he was made for life. With this little incident Gavin's career in Thrums began. I remembered it suddenly the other day when wading across the wynd where it took place. Many scenes in the little minister's life come back to me in this way. The first time I ever thought of writing his love story as an old man's gift to a little maid since grown tall, was one night while I sat alone in the school-house; on my knees a fiddle that has been my only living companion since I sold my hens. My mind had drifted back to the first time I saw Gavin and the Egyptian together, and what set it wandering to that midnight meeting was my garden gate shaking in the wind. At a gate on the hill I had first encountered these two. It rattled in his hand, and I looked up and saw them, and neither knew why I had such cause to start at the sight. Then the gate swung to. It had just such a click as mine.|$|E
60|$|February 15. Up {{with the}} sun. A {{brilliant}} morning, and frosty. A double suit of flannels is found necessary. The plain is perfectly level, {{and seems to}} stretch away and away and away, dimming and softening, to the uttermost bounds of nowhere. What a soaring, strenuous, gushing fountain spray of delicate greenery a bunch of bamboo is! As {{far as the eye}} can reach, these grand vegetable geysers grace the view, their spoutings refined to steam by distance. And there are fields of bananas, with the sunshine glancing from the varnished surface of their drooping vast leaves. And there are frequent groves of palm; and an effective accent is given to the landscape by isolated individuals of this picturesque family, towering, clean-stemmed, their plumes broken and hanging ragged, Nature's imitation of an umbrella that has been out to see what a cyclone is like and is <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> disappointed. And everywhere through the soft morning vistas we glimpse the villages, the countless villages, the myriad villages, thatched, built of clean new matting, snuggling among grouped palms and sheaves of bamboo; villages, villages, no end of villages, not three hundred yards apart, and dozens and dozens of them in sight all the time; a mighty City, hundreds of miles long, hundreds of miles broad, made all of villages, the biggest city in the earth, and as populous as a European kingdom. I have seen no such city as this before. And there is a continuously repeated and replenished multitude of naked men in view on both sides and ahead. We fly through it mile after mile, but still it is always there, on both sides and ahead--brown-bodied, naked men and boys, plowing in the fields. But not a woman. In these two hours I have not seen a woman or a girl working in the fields.|$|E

60|$|Meekly {{he drove}} past the cars so ebon and silvery, so smug and strong, {{that they would}} have {{regarded}} a Teal bug as an insult. Another attendant waved him into the elevator, and Milt <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised when the car started, not forward, but upward, as though it had turned into an aeroplane.|$|R
60|$|The {{company was}} silent {{in a moment}} at this reinforcement, and only the {{military}} <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised.

5000|$|Alexander McQueen later {{described}} {{his thoughts on}} the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour:"Ha!

5000|$|The {{role was}} given to Bobby Davro, known to the British {{audience}} as a 1980s comic, impressionist, and a 1990s children's TV presenter. Davro has revealed that he auditioned for the role {{on the advice of}} actress Barbara Windsor, who plays landlady Peggy Mitchell: [...] "It’s through her really that I got this chance." [...] Bobby Davro was said to be [...] "chuffed" [...] when he got the part. He has commented: [...] "EastEnders is a high-profile show, but I'm already used to the attention which being on telly brings … I love the part and I’m learning. I’m still <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> straight at the camera, that’s the entertainer in me! Everyone has just been fantastic … This is so exciting for me. I want to go in and really work hard and see myself get better … I’ve never really acted before…I’m enjoying learning the trade." ...|$|E

5000|$|Says Phipps of {{that moment}} in time, [...] "I {{holed up in a}} tiny room within a friend's {{warehouse}} and began knocking out as many different songs as I could. I <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back, just wanting to explore everything I could possibly create. I started to feel like I was becoming a Kafka-esque insomniac musical novelist at one point." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile I munched my Infant-Jesus-and-Dove arrangement, {{which was}} rather like eating thin glass, {{so hard and}} sharp. It was made of almond and white of egg presumably, and was not so bad if you could eat it at all. It was a Christmas relic.--And I watched the Holy Family across the narrow board, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> all I felt.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 the TV Azteca {{reporter}} {{sought an}} interview with then NY Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez, {{and she had been}} standing on the sidelines during practice when Jets players and coaches appeared to throw footballs in her direction. Later, as she waited in the locker room to conduct {{an interview with}} Sanchez, she was reportedly the target of lewd comments from players and staff. She tweeted in Spanish: [...] "I'm so uncomfortable! I'm in the Jets locker room waiting for Mark Sanchez and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around me." [...] And a few moments later, she wrote, [...] "I want to cover my ears." [...] Media persons reported that team members made [...] "catcalls and rude comments". According to Sainz, it was [...] "the rest of the media start to hear the different kind of things that I didn't hear." [...] She accepted a personal apology from Jets owner Woody Johnson when those incidents became known to him.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Is {{my promise}} so very important?' she asked. She glanced angrily {{at the three}} ladies who were hesitating in the doorway. Nevertheless, the ladies entered, and seated {{themselves}} {{at the opposite end}} of the carriage. Siegmund did not know whether he were displeased or relieved by their intrusion. If they had stayed out, he might have held Helena in his arms for still another hour. As it was, she could not harass him with words. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, but to think.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{in her room}} much longer than {{she thought it would}} have taken her aunt to explain what she had to say. At last, however, she heard footsteps in the corridor, and Griffiths knocked at the door. Her aunt would be obliged by her stepping into her room. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> disconcerted, and asked if Lord Cashel were still there. She was told that he was; and she felt that she had to muster up all her courage to encounter him.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} article in this journal, Fitzmaurice (2000) {{documented}} split negative infinitives such as (1) and argued that the construction originat-ing in the spoken media has now so spread that it may be conventionalized as unmarked. 1. She tends <b>to</b> <b>not</b> listen <b>to</b> what you’re saying. I agree with her general points and would like to make some additional comment on this construction. First, on the historical description of this construction, Fitzmaurice (2000, 61) wrote, “standard historical accounts of negation, such as Jespersen (1917), also restrict their attention to clausal negation and do not describe split negative infinitives. ” This generalization must be slightly amended, however, for Jespersen was not unaware of the possibility of this construc-tion and did describe it in his later work (1940, 442 – 43), although he admitted he could not find relevant citation to substantiate his prediction at the time: Where we have a verb connected with an infinitive, it is often of great importance whether the negation refers to the nexus (main verb) or to the infinitive. In the earlier stages of the language this was not always clear: he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> that way was ambiguous; now the introduction of do as the auxiliary of a negative nexus has rendered a differentiation possible; he did <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> that way / he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> that way; and the (not yet recognized) placing of <b>not</b> after <b>to</b> serves to make the latter sentence even more unambiguous: he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> that way. The use of split infinitives may be fairly recent, and I have two pieces of anecdotal evidence to show that it has become conventionalized. One is the audio book version of the now classic The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett (1930, 31) : 2. “We believed your two hundred dollars. ” “You mean–? ” She seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know what he meant...|$|R
