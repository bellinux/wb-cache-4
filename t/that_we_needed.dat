We couldn't live in our own skin if we admitted <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> {{to believe that it}} was our choice." [...] Falle's pimp told her he would marry her if she made enough money for him through prostitution. When she had made the amount of money her pimp required, she was 17 years old. The two got married that year.|$|E
500|$|Fanning {{first met}} Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland {{economics}} class in 1989. At {{the time of}} the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that [...] "It was a big thing to convince the others <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 16 May 1998, Arsenal contested the 1998 FA Cup Final against Newcastle United. Without {{first choice}} striker Bergkamp, Wenger partnered Anelka with Wreh, leaving Wright on the {{substitutes}} bench. Arsenal {{scored in the}} 23rd minute; Overmars sprinted onto a pass from Petit, and used his pace to get past Alessandro Pistone and toe-poke the ball between goalkeeper Shay Given's legs. Anelka scored in the second half, from a pass by Parlour to settle the match. In his post-match interview, Wenger praised the [...] "remarkable" [...] Overmars: [...] " [...] even more so when you realise that he has scored so many goals in important games <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to win." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the poor}} {{commercial}} performance of The Eternal Idol, Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August {{to begin work}} on their next album. As {{a result of the}} recording troubles with Eternal Idol, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. [...] "It was a completely new start", Iommi said. [...] "I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to build up some credibility again". Iommi enlisted former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a [...] "very cheap studio in England".|$|E
500|$|The Daily Stormer {{capitalized}} on {{the popularity of}} the augmented reality video game Pokémon Go in mid-2016 to distribute racist flyers to children congregating in public to play the game, with Anglin explaining that [...] "I have long thought <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to get pre-teens involved in the movement. At that age, you can really brainwash someone easily. Anyone who accepts Nazism at the age of 10 or 11 {{is going to be a}} Nazi for life." [...] On May 3, 2017, one day after a deadly stabbing attack at the University of Texas, racist flyers were posted across campus with the website address for The Daily Stormer, a caricature of a black person, and the line [...] "...around blacks... never relax!".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} then filmed in Budapest, Hungary over several days. [...] "The {{reason for the}} {{location}} stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. So the location thing happened mainly so it wouldn't fly into the sky. Being connoisseurs of parking lots, {{we wanted to find}} a good example. But it was a technical reason that made us go with it," [...] Knight said. Ne-o used an Arri Super 16mm film camera to shoot the film then edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro, with 3D animation using Autodesk Softimage.|$|E

500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{kick off}} the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis {{recalled}} the situation: [...] "Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> a police escort to get near the stage." [...] Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, {{and then at the}} Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.|$|E

500|$|Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup {{supervisor}} Michael J. Mills {{was kept}} busy preparing {{the large number}} of other aliens called for in the script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a Star Trek film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such {{an important role in the}} film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> something to get the shot done, then we'd have it." [...] The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.|$|E
500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> something to follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E
500|$|Recording for Blur's next album {{began in}} London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the {{sessions}} moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, {{and then to}} Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon said [...] "there were no rows" [...] and [...] " [...] just recognised the feeling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> some time apart". Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, [...] "Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb" [...] as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and {{was part of the}} band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be [...] "a rockin' record", and also said that it has [...] "a lot of finely crafted pop songs". Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down; however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless.|$|E

500|$|The games' soundtrack, titled [...]hack//Game Music Perfect Collection, was {{released}} as a double album in Japan on April 23, 2003. It features 68compositions by Chikayo Fukuda, Seizo Nakata, and Norikatsu Fukuda. A {{special edition of}} this soundtrack includes a third disc featuring sound effects and clips used in the games. The album {{was released}} with fewer tracks in North America as [...]hack//Game Music Best Collection. Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc's generic town and battle themes. He called the soundtrack [...] "techno meets opera", singled out the volume intro tracks for particular praise. Gann noted that the North American release functions as a [...] "Best of" [...] album, but felt that [...] "a lot of solid music [...] missing" [...] in this release. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic; Paul Koehler of RPGamer called the music [...] "particularly bland" [...] and IGN's Dunham lamented that the second installment did not introduce many new pieces. However, he concluded that [...] "the melodious piano and oboe themes were still brawny enough to convince us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to buy the soundtrack sometime in the near future".|$|E
500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were his kind of people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I made up my mind <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E
