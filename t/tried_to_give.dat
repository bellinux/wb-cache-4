5|$|The stadium {{was called}} Estádio do Corinthians by Corinthians {{when it was}} announced. The name being used on the club's {{official}} website is Arena Corinthians. The Brazilian Football Confederation uses the name Arena Corinthians. FIFA refers to the Stadium as Arena de São Paulo during the World Cup, but recognises the name Arena Corinthians. The largest media company in Brazil, Rede Globo, uses Arena Corinthians like sports diary Lance! Local media have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it nicknames. For example, newspaper Folha refer to Arena Corinthians as Itaquerão; O Estado de S. Paulo uses both the neighbourhood-based nickname and the official name. Rede Record uses Fielzão.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E

5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
5|$|Crewe manager Dario Gradi {{decided not}} to offer a {{contract}} to Symes, who instead spent a period on trial at Bradford City, which included an 8–1 pre-season friendly win over Farsley Celtic. He signed for the League One side in July 2004 with fellow former Everton trainee Steven Schumacher, with whom he lived during his spell at Bradford. Symes made his Bradford debut in a 2–1 defeat at Hartlepool United on {{the opening day of}} the 2004–05 season. Three days later he missed a late penalty which would have secured Bradford victory over Peterborough United in a game in which Symes was also booked. Symes was dropped from the first team after Bradford signed Dele Adebola. When Bradford were allowed special dispensation to sign Neil Roberts, Bradford <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Symes a loan transfer to Darlington but the deal was blocked by the Football League. The following month, Symes scored his first goals for Bradford when he came off the bench at half-time to score twice in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 23 October 2004. They were the only goals he scored that season from just 15 games.|$|E

25|$|The {{most recent}} critics, {{starting}} from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately {{in the context of}} the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination—using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities—against the prejudices expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that probably were more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.|$|E

But when a mistrial was declared on October 1, 1957, after two weeks of deliberations, the three witnesses would give up on their own individual lawsuits. But Edmund Brown preempted Confidentials win by calling for a retrial. Harrison was rattled. To spare his niece another ordeal—and the danger of three-years' imprisonment—Harrison promised the Attorney General to publish only positive stories.|$|E

25|$|The 1849 {{discovery}} of the iron cage buried in the cemetery of St-Joseph parish (now the Lauzon district) served to reawaken the legends and the fantastic stories, which were amplified and used by 19th-century writers. The first, in 1863, Philippe Aubert de Gaspé in Les Anciens Canadiens, has a supernatural Corriveau hanging in the Pointe-Levy cage, terrorising one night a passer-by conducting a witches' Sabbath and Will-o'-the-wisp at the Île d'Orléans. James MacPherson Le Moine (Maple Leaves, 1863) and William Kirby, following in his footsteps (The Golden Dog, 1877), made her a professional poisoner, a direct descendant of La Voisin, famous for her purported role in The Affair of the Poisons. Writers and historians such as Louis Fréchette and Pierre-Georges Roy have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Corriveau's history, but without completely separating the facts from the anachronistic fantasies added in legend and novels.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the ancient}} Near East, and also in archaic Greece, used only the frontal and profile view. Only {{classical}} Greek style introduced an intermediate step, especially the three-quarter view. Representations of the classical Greeks tried the illusion of life in all its forms. The characters are totally preoccupied with themselves and ignore the viewer. The frontal view is also found here, but {{is only one of}} many possibilities. Parthian art certainly took over the frontal view of Hellenistic art, but it appears the Parthians in their art again took recourse with the presence of the Ancient Orient. The Parthian art is not an illusion and tried to capture the fleeting nature of life. Rather, they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the figures durability. They tried to capture the true content of life and not just the outer shell. The effect of such methods is often that the viewer feels transcended.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Carlist-controlled territory, Maroto was well {{received by the}} Pretender, who seated him on numerous occasions at his table and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a responsible command, which {{he was unable to}} accomplish because of the opposition of General Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who always had a negative view of Maroto. When Zumalacárregui was injured in Bilbao, Maroto received a direct order from Don Carlos to replace him and took command of his army. However, the written order, manipulated, was confusing and almost contradictory: Don Carlos ordered that Maroto remain in the army, but under the orders of field marshal Francisco Benito Eraso, until, for reasons of health, the latter retired from the Army of the North. He was told to remain patient and in the meantime to obverse the actions of said general, which could be suspicious. Maroto's serious, authentically soldierly character won him at this time the friendship and confidence {{of the members of the}} forces, especially the common soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The wicket {{began to}} take ever {{increasing}} turn and wickets fell regularly to the England off-spinners Fred Titmus (4/40) and Dave Allen (4/47). Titmus took his 100th Test wicket and as he had passed 1,000 Test runs in the England innings completed the double of 1,000 Test runs and 100 Test wickets. Jim Parks failed to dismiss any batsmen, but the expert close fielders Mike Smith and Colin Cowdrey took five catches between them. Doug Walters top scored with 35 not out and David Sincock hit 5 fours in his 27 as Australia fell to 174 all out and an innings defeat on the fourth day. Smith <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Dave Allen the honour of leading the England team off the field, but {{he and the others}} insisted that their captain should enter the pavilion first. They were greeted by the Australian captain Brian Booth, who shook hands with all the England players with his typical good sportsmanship.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{in order}} to divert {{attention}} from the controversial One Unit Program, Prime Minister Suhrawardy tried to end the crises by calling a small group of investors to set up small business in the country. Despite many initiatives and holding off the NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy's political position and image was worsen and deteriorated in the four provinces in West Pakistan. Many nationalist leaders and activists of the Muslim League were dismayed with the suspension of the constitutionally obliged NFC Program while nationalists. His critics and Muslim League leaders observed that with the suspension of NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> more financial allocations, aids, grants, and opportunity to East-Pakistan than West Pakistan, including West Pakistan's four provinces. During the last days of his Prime ministerial years, Suhrawardy tried to remove the economic disparity between the Eastern and Western wings of the country but to no avail. He also tried unsuccessfully to alleviate the food shortage in the country.|$|E
25|$|Alaric {{moved to}} Rome and {{captured}} Galla Placidia, sister of Honorius. The Senate in Rome, despite its loathing for Alaric, was now desperate {{enough to give}} him almost anything he wanted. They had no food to offer, but they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him imperial legitimacy; with the Senate's acquiescence, he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor, and he marched on Ravenna. Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna. These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on. He had Constantine's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius's defence. Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa, and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful. Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls. Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage, failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius (who was offered mutilation, humiliation, and exile). Indeed, Attalus's claim was a marker of threat to Honorius, and Alaric dethroned him after a few months.|$|E
