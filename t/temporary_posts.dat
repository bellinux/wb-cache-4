5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Bruce was employed {{after his return}} from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him <b>temporary</b> <b>posts.</b> Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who {{had worked as a}} nurse in Samuel Bruce's London surgery. Bruce's marriage took place in the United Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended and witnessed by their parents. Perhaps, due to Bruce's secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Rock Springs was stabilized {{as early as}} September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not back at work in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

As a whole, however, {{they had not been}} badly treated here, and had been allowed to {{continue}} to cultivate their land, subject only to about the same taxation as they had paid to Egypt. Of course, from what they have done elsewhere, the comparative mildness of the conduct of the Dervishes was not due to any feeling of mercy, but to policy. As the most advanced position, with the exception of scattered and <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> lower down the river, it was necessary that there should be food for the considerable body of tribesmen encamped at Dongola; especially as an army invading Egypt would provide itself, there, with stores for the journey. It was therefore good policy to encourage the cultivators of land to stay there." ...|$|E

Near Fort Espérance both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company had <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> that were {{apparently}} called Fort Qu'Appelle.

It was an outpost of Fort Ellice and was mainly a source of pemmican. In 1864 it was moved to the present site of Fort Qu'Appelle.|$|E

5000|$|Peirce {{suffered}} from his late teens {{through the rest}} of his life with an ailment then known as [...] "facial neuralgia" [...] which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia, a chronic, intensely painful condition (whose sufferers, more often women than men, usually develop it after age 50) against which he self-medicated with drugs such as morphine, cocaine, and alcohol. His mental and physical illnesses worsened with time, and he suffered numerous breakdowns over the course of his life, rendering him increasingly unreliable. His earnings from <b>temporary</b> <b>posts,</b> lectures and articles dwindled, until he and Juliette lived in poverty. At his death he had more than 100,000 pages of unpublished writing.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the posts}} lasted {{less than ten}} years because the area became {{depleted}} of beaver and because the wooden stockades tended to rot. The major or permanent posts on the North Saskatchewan River were Cumberland House, Fort Pitt, Fort Carlton, Edmonton and Rocky Mountain House. Especially in the east {{there were a number}} of minor <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> that left few or no records. Until 1811, fur traders affiliated with the NWC and HBC maintained very amicable relations to the extent that the rival posts were often enclosed within the same palisades for mutual protections. After 1811, however, competition between the HBC and the NWC became increasingly intense (Blondal et al. 2008)[...]|$|E
50|$|Fur {{trade on}} the lower river: The first European to ascended the river {{as far as the}} forks was Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye in spring 1739.

There were also a number of <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> that have left few records. By far the most {{important}} post was Cumberland House which was the depot for the route northwest to the rich Athabasca country.

5000|$|ARP wardens were {{initially}} {{set up in}} <b>temporary</b> <b>posts</b> (in homes, shops and offices) and later in purpose-built facilities, mainly at the junctions of roads. In cities, a warden post was responsible for a small area (larger in rural areas) with five wardens to every 4-5,000 people. In London there were approximately ten posts to the square mile. Divided into sectors each post had between three and six wardens who had local knowledge of the location of shelters, utilities (water, gas, electric), what buildings contained (important for the fire services) and who was resident in their sector. ARP wardens had the task of patrolling the streets during blackout, {{to ensure that no}} light was visible. If a light was spotted, the warden would alert the person/people responsible by shouting something like [...] "Put that light out!". They could report persistent offenders to the local police.|$|E
