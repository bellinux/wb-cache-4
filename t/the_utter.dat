5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew {{seems to have been}} less than loyal to him and to have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he perceived to be <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He {{set out to make}} a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} with Persia, the process by which the Delian League became the Athenian Empire reached its conclusion. The allies of Athens were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships, despite the cessation of hostilities. In Greece, the First Peloponnesian War between the power-blocs of Athens and Sparta, which had continued on/off since 460 BC, finally ended in 445 BC, with the agreement of a thirty-year truce. However, the growing enmity between Sparta and Athens would lead, just 14 years later, into the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War. This disastrous conflict, which dragged on for 27 years, would eventually result in <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> destruction of Athenian power, the dismemberment of the Athenian empire, and the establishment of a Spartan hegemony over Greece. However, not just Athens suffered—{{the conflict}} would significantly weaken the whole of Greece.|$|E

25|$|Japanese statism was discredited and {{destroyed}} by <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> failure of Japan's military in World War II. After {{the surrender of}} Japan, Japan was put under allied occupation.

25|$|The above {{description}} of the constitution basically follows Warmington. Largely it is taken from descriptions by Greek foreigners who likely would see in Carthage reflections of their own institutions. How strong was the Hellenizing influence within Carthage? The basic difficulty {{is the lack of}} adequate writings due to the secretive nature of the Punic state as well as to <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> destruction of the capital city and its records.

25|$|Any Attakkatha {{fulfills}} its objective if it affords {{a variety}} of scenes depicting different types of characters, and each scene would have its own hero with the rasa associated with that character. When that hero is portrayed he is given utmost importance, to <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> neglect of the main sentiment (rasa) of the theme in general. However, the purpose of Attakkatha is not to present a theme with a well-knit emotional plot as its central point, but to present all approved types of characters already set to suit the technique {{of the art of}} Kathakali.|$|E

25|$|May 1. Fine weather, to {{the great}} comfort of the {{locomotive}} public. Never knew the city in such a chaotic state.

We certainly haven't advanced as a people beyond the nomadic or migratory stage of civilization analogous to that of the pastoral cow feeders of the Tartar Steppes.|$|E
25|$|The Caliphate {{believed}} {{it would take}} a generation, but Charles managed it in five years. Prepared to face the Frankish phalanx, the Muslims were totally unprepared to face a mixed force of heavy cavalry and infantry in a phalanx. Thus, Charles again halted Muslim expansion into Europe. These defeats, plus those at the hands of Leo III of the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia, were the last great attempt at expansion by the Umayyad Caliphate before the destruction of the dynasty at the Battle of the Zab, and the rending of the Caliphate forever, especially <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> destruction of the Umayyad army at River Berre near Narbonne in 737.|$|E
25|$|In 1235 four Dominican friars, {{among them}} Friar Julian, left the kingdom {{to find a}} Hungarian group whose {{ancestors}} had remained somewhere in the East in the 9thcentury. Julian met them in modern Bashkortostan (Russia) where he also learnt of the danger exposed by the expanding Mongol Empire. The Mongol armies set out for Hungary {{in the spring of}} 1241, and incited a disastrous defeat to the royal army at Muhi. In the battle both Hungarian archbishops perished, along with other prelates and barons. Contemporary sources, among them Roger of Torre Maggiore, depict <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> desolation and destruction inflicted by the Mongols. All of the forty monasteries that are known to have disappeared at this time lay in the area affected by the invaders.|$|E

25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone.

In an agreement with Richard, Lady Shiva arrives with a helicopter to usher The Question and Aristotle Rodor away, at which point she decides to stay in Hub City and embrace the chaos. Vic nearly convinces Myra to come with him and escape the chaos of the city. Myra remembers the people of the city who need her, mainly the children.

25|$|Finally {{in desperation}} {{he used his}} hands. Miaoshan, {{realising}} the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent <b>the</b> <b>utter</b> destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E
