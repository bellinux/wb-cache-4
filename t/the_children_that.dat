Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>that</b> participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5000|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} is often kept secret: A victim {{of child sexual}} abuse is under a great deal of {{pressure}} to keep the abuse secret. In many cases of <b>child</b> molestation, <b>the</b> molester has threatened to harm <b>the</b> <b>child</b> or a member of <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> family. <b>The</b> molester might have told <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> he would not be believed even if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> did tell. Another common situation is that the molester will tell <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> <b>child</b> tells about <b>the</b> abuse, he will get into trouble. The clear message is given to <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> if another person finds out, something bad will happen to <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> This pressure to maintain silence can often be successfully overcome by establishing open communication between children and adults through a proper educational program for children.|$|R

25|$|In the {{background}} of the series, the Children of the Forest fought a series of wars against the First Men (a civilization of primitive warriors wielding bronze weapons and riding horses), until the Pact of the Isle of Faces, wherein the First Men obtained control of the open lands and <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>that</b> of the forests. The Pact was weakened after four thousand years by the emergence of the Others, who were vanquished by the combined use of obsidian, fire, the magic of the old gods, and the building of the Wall. In the following centuries the Children gradually disappeared, and it was presumed that they left Westeros or became extinct. Little of their legacy is present in the series beyond their worship of nameless gods, still practiced by some in the North, and the remaining Weirwoods through which the Children communicated telepathically.|$|E

Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>that</b> were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies.
