Palios become Executive Chairman of the club, with Nicola as Vice-Chairman, and Johnson as Honorary President. This ended Johnson's 27-year spell as an owner, which counts the most successful period in the club's history due to three consecutive First Division play-off finishes in the early 90s and the 2000 Football League Cup Final. The next day assistant manager John McMahon left the club by mutual agreement as Rob Edwards wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in his coaching department. Alex Russell, familiar to Edwards from playing at Exeter, joined Tranmere Rovers as the Club's new first team coach.|$|E

In April 2009, ahead of the Rome Masters, Djokovic hired Austrian Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (formerly worked with Thomas Muster) to join the team in fitness coach capacity.|$|E

25|$|Metallurgica Brescia gia Tempini in 1912 {{attempted}} {{to improve the}} design of the Model 1910. The improved pistol, referred to as the Brixia, was submitted to the Italian Army for approval. The Brixia had a strengthened frame and removed the grip safety but wasn't a big enough improvement <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the Italian Army. The Brixia was later to be sold to the civilian market but the outbreak of World War I led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s IFMSA issued {{a number of}} resolutions and {{declarations}} on topics ranging from Medical Education to the Prevention of Nuclear War to Primary Health Care. In the late 80's there was a push towards organizing projects that would be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> locally and thus the Village Concept Project idea was born after collaboration with other international student organizations. 1986 also saw {{the start of the}} Leadership Training Programs in collaboration with World Health Organization. These training programs are still active today.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} attempts {{on record}} {{to change the}} calendar were superficial. On the 800th anniversary of the calendar (29 March 1438), King Mohnyin Thado recalibrated the calendar to Year 2 (with Year Zero beginning on 18 March 1436). But the king died {{just over a year}} after the launch, and the new era died out a few years later. The next proposed change came in March 1638 from King Prasat Thong of Siam who in preparation of the upcoming millennial anniversary (10 April 1638) wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> to the governing animals of the months. As the practice was not prevalent in Burma, the proposal was rejected by King Thalun.|$|E

25|$|Many PID loops {{control a}} {{mechanical}} device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance {{can be a}} major cost and wear leads to control degradation {{in the form of}} either stiction or a deadband in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change.</b> Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.|$|E

Torque and Dallas {{make it to the}} loading bay, and Torque heads to the control room, opening the doors, and allowing Dallas to escape. However, a fire starts, preventing Torque from following. He then hears a call from Consuela Alvarez (Meg Savlov), Ernesto's wife, asking Ernesto to call her. She tells him that herself and the girls are fine, but there is a fire in the nearby forest getting closer to their house.|$|E

One proposed 14-club system includes giving first-round byes for the teams with {{the best record in}} each conference, two division champions in each conference receiving home games, and the remaining eight teams would be seeded by win-loss record. However, by the following February 2015, the Washington Post reported that support among team owners has eroded, and league leaders expressed reluctance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> until the one-year extension with CBS to televise Thursday Night Football expired {{at the end of the}} 2015 season. [...] The proposal lost all interest, and as of 2017, has not been raised again. [...] It is likely that no movement will be made on expanding either the playoffs or the regular season until at least 2020, when the current collective bargaining agreement expires.|$|E
500|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. The year after, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series. When Jackson was sixteen, she was arranged a contract with A Records and released her self-titled debut album in 1982. She stated, [...] "On my first album the songs were sort of teenage like. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> for my second album. The first album indroduces you. The second one sets your image. I couldn't stay like that. People would still look at me as a little girl and I'd never grow". [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was written by Jackson, her brother Marlon Jackson and musician John Barnes. Marlon Jackson also produced the single and provided backing vocals along with his brothers Michael, Tito, and Jackie. Although it was slated for a mid-July release, [...] "Don't Stand Another Chance" [...] was released on August 13, 1984.|$|E
