MethodsSetaria cervi worms were implanted in white rats via laparotomy and microfilaraemic rats were divided into 4 groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were treated with DEC, <b>tetramisole</b> and chlorpromazine respectively, while Group 4 served as infected control. Longevity of microfilariae and differential leucocyte counts were recorded till the disappearance of microfilariae from peripheral blood. Glucose- 6 -phosphatase and succinate dehydrogenase enzymes were localized in the microfilariae recovered from normal and treated rats. ResultsThe microfilariae survived for 48 days in untreated rats while survival was reduced to 15, 21 and 27 days after treatment with DEC, <b>tetramisole</b> and chlorpromazine, respectively.

The <b>tetramisole</b> derivative quenched the fluorescence of the intramembrane probe 8 -(2 -anthryl) -octanoic acid. The quenching process could be rationalized by a model for dynamic quenching in which an intermediate excited-state non-emitting complex (PQ) * between neutral quencher (Q) and excited probe (P*) is involved: Q(A) half-arrow-right-over-half-arrow-left Q(L) + P(L) * k(-d) half-arrow-right-over-half-arrow-left k(d) (PQ) L* [...] > k(i) P + Q where k(d), k(-d) and k(i) represent the rate constants of complex formation, dissociation and deactivation, respectively. The subscripts A and L denote the aqueous and lipid phases, and the asterisk indicates the excited state. Linear Stern-Volmer plots were obtained from quenching experiments of fluorescence intensities and fluorescence lifetimes. The slopes of the plots were dependent on the lipid volume fraction of the liposomes. Measurement of the reciprocal of the apparent bimolecular quenching rate constant at various lipid volume fractions yielded the partition coefficient K(p) and the overall quenching rate constant k(q) [k(q) = k(d) k(i) /(k(i) + k(-d) ] of the <b>tetramisole</b> derivative. The steady-state measurements were performed at three different pH-values. Time-correlated single photon counting measurements revealed a single-exponential fluorescence decay for 8 -(2 -anthryl) -octanoic acid in the presence and absence of quencher. The quenching results were in accordance with the model that only the neutral form is capable of partitioning into the lipid phase. Combined average values of 318 and 6. 59 x 10 (8) M- 1 s- 1 were calculated for the partition coefficient and the bimolecular quenching rate constant, respectively, from the steady-state and time-resolved quenching experiments. status: publishe...|$|E

Linear Stern-Volmer plots were obtained for each derivative, indicating dynamic quenching. The slopes of the plots decreased with increasing liposomal concentration. For four short-chain homologues (-H, -ethyl, -n-propyl and -n-butyl), the respective membrane partition coefficients K(p) and bimolecular quenching rate constants k(q) were determined from the plots of the reciprocal of the apparent quenching rate constant (k(q) app) - 1 against the lipid volume fraction alpha(L) of the liposomes.

40|$|The {{issue of}} drug {{chirality}} is attracting increasing attention among the scientific community. If we consider that approximately 56 % of the pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in use are chiral {{it is surprising}} that this phenomenon has been overlooked in environmental research (environmental, occurrence, fate and toxicity). Chiral PACs can exist as two non-superimposable mirror-image isomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers show idential physicochemical properties but they differ in their interactions with other chiral molecules. As a consequence of this stereoselectivity, enantiomers of the same chiral PAC can differ in their biological properties such as distribution, metabolism and excretion. Despite the fact that usually one enantiomer is responsible for the desired activity, whereas the other may be inactive or have high toxicity, many drugs have been and still are marketed as racemic mixtures (equimolar mixture of two enantiomers). Furthermore, the relative concentration of enantiomers of a chiral PAC, so called “enantiomeric fraction” EF, can change significantly following intake, by human or animal metabolism, during biological wastewater treatment and/or during biological processes in the environment (KASPRZYK-HORDERN, 2010), leading to an excess of one of the enantiomers. Enantiomers can also undergo chiral inversion to form an enantiomer of potentially higher toxicity. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate an enantioselective method for the simultaneous determination of human and veterinary chiral PACs and their metabolites in surface water and effluent wastewater by chiral liquid chromatography using a chiral α 1 -acid glycoprotein column (Chiral AGP) and tandem mass spectrometry. Excellent chromatographic separation of enantiomers (Rs ≥ 1. 0) was achieved for fexofenadine (antihistamine), chloramphenicol (antibacterial), ifosfamide (anticancer), naproxen, ibuprofen and the metabolite dihydroketoprofen (antiinflammatories), <b>tetramisole</b> and its metabolite aminorex (anthelmintic); and partial enantioseparation (Rs = 0. 7 - 1. 0) for ketoprofen (antiinflammatory) and praziquantel (anthelmintic) and the metabolites 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide and 10, 11 -dihydroxycarbamazepine. The overall performance of the method was satisfactory for most of the compounds targeted. Method detection limits were at low ng/L for surface water and effluent wastewater. Method intra-day precision was on average under 20 % for both matrices. Sample pre-concentration using solid phase extraction yielded recoveries above 70 % for most of the analytes.

40|$|A generic continuous-flow assay for phosphate-consuming or -releasing enzymes coupled on-line to liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) has been developed. Operating the LC-biochemical assay {{in combination with}} mass spectrometry allows the fast detection and identification of inhibitors of these enzymes in complex mixtures. The assay {{is based on the}} detection of phosphate, released by the on-line continuous-flow enzymatic reaction, using a fluorescent probe. The probe consists of fluorophore-labeled phosphate-binding protein, which shows a strong fluorescence enhancement upon binding to inorganic phosphate. To detect very small changes of the phosphate concentration in a postcolumn enzymatic reaction medium, the enzymatic removal of phosphate impurities from solvents, reagents, and samples was optimized for application in continuous flow. The potential of the phosphate probe is demonstrated by monitoring the enzymatic activity, i. e., the phosphate release, from alkaline phosphatase. The selectivity of the phosphate readout, necessary to distinguish between phosphate containing substrate or product and free inorganic phosphate released after enzymatic conversion, is shown. The applicability of LC coupled to the enzymatic assay using the phosphate readout was demonstrated by detection of <b>tetramisole</b> in a plant extract as inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the true impact of each single {{enantiomer}} of pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in the environment, highly efficient, fast and sensitive analytical methods are needed. For {{the first time this}} paper focuses on the use of ultrahigh performance supercritical fluid based chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer to develop multi-residue enantioselective methods for chiral PACs in environmental matrices. This technique exploits the advantages of supercritical fluid chromatography, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Two coated modified 2. 5 μm-polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases were investigated: an amylose tris- 3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate column and a cellulose tris- 3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate column. The effect of different chromatographic variables on chiral recognition is highlighted. This novel approach resulted in the baseline resolution of 13 enantiomers PACs (aminorex, carprofen, chloramphenicol, 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide, flurbiprofen, 2 -hydroxyibuprofen, ifosfamide, imazalil, naproxen, ofloxacin, omeprazole, praziquantel and <b>tetramisole)</b> and partial resolution of 2 enantiomers PACs (ibuprofen and indoprofen) under fast-gradient conditions (< 10 min analysis time).

40|$|The recent {{finding that}} the FDA-approved antiobesity agent {{orlistat}} (tetrahydrolipstatin, Xenical) is a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS) led us to develop a concise and practical asymmetric route to pseudosymmetric 3, 4 -dialkyl-cis-beta-lactones. The well-documented upregulation of FAS in cancer cells makes this enzyme complex an interesting therapeutic target for cancer. The described route to 3, 4 -dialkyl- beta -lactones {{is based on a}} two-step process involving Calter's catalytic, asymmetric ketene dimerization of acid chlorides followed by a facialselective hydrogenation leading to cis-substituted- beta -lactones. Importantly, the ketene dimer intermediates were found to be stable to flash chromatography, enabling opportunities for subsequent transformations of these optically active, reactive intermediates. Subsequent R-epimerization and R-alkylation or acylation led to trans- beta - lactones and beta -lactones bearing alpha-quaternary carbons, respectively. Several of the ketene dimers and beta-lactones displayed antagonistic activity (apparent Ki in the low micromolar range) in competition with a fluorogenic substrate toward a recombinant form of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase. The best antagonist, a simple phenyl-substituted cis- beta -lactone, displayed an apparent Ki (2. 5 (0. 5 muM) of only 10 - fold lower than that of orlistat (0. 28 (0. 06 muM). In addition, mechanistic studies of the ketene dimerization process by Reaction View infrared spectroscopy support previous findings that ketene formation is rate determining. A highly diastereoselective, nucleophile-promoted bis-cyclization process, employing readily available and tractable keto-acid substrates, is described. This methodology provides concise access to bicyclic- and tricyclic-beta-lactones bearing tertiary carbinol centers and quaternary carbons, greatly extending the scope of previous routes to bicyclic-beta-lactones from aldehyde acid substrates. This and related processes may be revealing a subtle interplay between [2 plus 2] cycloaddition and nucleophilecatalyzed aldol lactonization (NCAL) reaction manifolds. An early induction period in the bis-cyclization of keto-acids is confirmed via isolation of the complex between 4 - pyrrolopyridine and Modified Mukaiyama reagent N-propyl- 2 -bromo pyridinium triflate. Dyotropic rearrangements of tricyclic keto beta-lactones derived in high yields and > 19 : 1 diastereoselectivity from readily available 1, 3 -dione acids is described. Zn (II) salts were found to be most efficient for affecting dyotropic 1, 2 -acyl migrations where as sub stoichiometric TMSOTf was found to execute a delta-lactone migration providing bis gamma-lactone in modest yields. Enantioselective desymmetrization with inexpensive (S) - <b>tetramisole</b> has been demonstrated to provide direct evidence of Lewis base involvement in the Nucleophile Promoted Bis-cyclization of keto-acids. Further studies using TsCl as the carboxylate activating agent instead of modified Mukaiyama reagent and catalytic <b>tetramisole</b> are described for achieving practical, catalytic, enantioselective synthesis of beta-lactones from keto-acids. Preliminary studies toward conjugate addition- lactonization pathway provided a hint as to the complexity involved to affect this transformation under the bis-cyclization conditions. An alternate hypotheses concerning the possibility of isomerization-dienolate formation - lactonization is experimentally proven. Additionally, applications of these and related findings in the intramolecular Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction with cyclic ketones have been investigated which provide new avenues of synthetic methodology development...|$|E

In polyacrylamide films, the formazan production specifically due to alkaline phosphatase was highest when using a medium containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9. 0, 0. 2 - 1. 0 mM substrate, 0. 32 mM 1 -methoxyphenazine methosulphate, 10 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM sodium azide and 1 mM tetranitro BT. For the incubation of cryostat sections {{in the presence of}} polyvinyl alcohol, the same medium could be used but the optimum concentrations of substrate and tetranitro BT appeared to be 1 - 2 mM and 5 mM respectively. The test minus control reaction was specific for alkaline phosphatase activity and could be inhibited completely with <b>tetramisole.</b> The test minus control reaction was linear with time up to 30 min with model films and up to 15 min with cryostat sections. The formazan production was also linear with the amount of homogenate incorporated in model films and with section thickness up to 18 micron and therefore, the reaction obeyed the Beer-Lambert law. Variation of the substrate concentration yielded a KM of 0. 05 mM for aqueous media and a KM of 0. 55 mM for polyvinyl alcohol-containing media. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Lymphatic Filariasis, a Neglected Tropical Disease, {{is caused}} by thread-like {{parasitic}} worms, including B. malayi, which migrate to the human lymphatic system following transmission. The parasites reside in collecting lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes for years, often resulting in lymphedema, elephantiasis or hydrocele. The mechanisms driving worm migration and retention within the lymphatics are currently unknown. We have developed an integrated in vitro imaging platform capable of quantifying B. malayi migration and behavior in a multicellular microenvironment relevant to the initial site of worm injection by incorporating the worm in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel {{in the presence of}} human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The platform utilizes a motorized controllable microscope with CO 2 and temperature regulation to allow for worm tracking experiments with high resolution over large length and time scales. Using post-acquisition algorithms, we quantified four parameters: 1) speed, 2) thrashing intensity, 3) percentage of time spent in a given cell region and 4) persistence ratio. We demonstrated the utility of our system by quantifying these parameters for L 3 B. malayi in the presence of LECs and HDFs. Speed and thrashing increased in the presence of both cell types and were altered within minutes upon exposure to the anthelmintic drug, <b>tetramisole.</b> The worms displayed no targeted migration towards either cell type for the time course of this study (3 hours). When cells were not present in the chamber, worm thrashing correlated directly with worm speed. However, this correlation was lost in the presence of cells. The described platform provides the ability to further study B. malayi migration and behavior...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{livestock}} {{health services}} remain {{one of the}} main constraints to livestock production in many developing countries, including Ethiopia. A study was carried out in 11 districts of North Gondar, from December 2011 to September 2012, with the objective of identifying the existing status and constraints of animal health service delivery, and thus recommending possible alternatives for its sustainable improvement. Data were collected by using pre-tested questionnaires and focus group discussion. Findings revealed that 46. 34 % of the responding farmers had taken their animals to government veterinary clinics after initially trying treatments with local medication. More than 90. 00 % of the clinical cases were diagnosed solely on clinical signs or even history alone. The antibacterial drugs found in veterinary clinics were procaine penicillin (with or without streptomycin), oxytetracycline and sulphonamides, whilst albendazole, <b>tetramisole</b> and ivermectin were the only anthelmintics. A thermometer was the only clinical aid available in all clinics, whilst only nine (45. 00 %) clinics had a refrigerator. In the private sector, almost 95. 00 % were retail veterinary pharmacies and only 41. 20 % fulfilled the requirement criteria set. Professionals working in the government indicated the following problems: lack of incentives (70. 00 %), poor management and lack of awareness (60. 00 %) and inadequate budget (40. 00 %). For farmers, the most frequent problems were failure of private practitioners to adhere to ethical procedures (74. 00 %) and lack of knowledge of animal diseases and physical distance from the service centre (50. 00 %). Of all responding farmers, 58. 54 % preferred the government service, 21. 14 % liked both services equally and 20. 33 % preferred the private service. Farmers’ indiscriminate use of drugs from the black market (23. 00 %) was also mentioned as a problem by private practitioners. Sustainable improvement of animal health service delivery needs increased awareness for all stakeholders and a well-regulated private service in order to mitigate the constraints apparent in the government service. </span...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, climbazole, oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and <b>tetramisole.</b> Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
40|$|A two-year {{epidemiology}} {{study of}} helminths of small ruminants involved {{the collection of}} viscera from 655 sheep and 632 goats from 4 abattoirs in eastern Ethiopia. A further more detailed epidemiology study of gastro-intestinal nematode infections used the Haramaya University (HU) flock of 60 Black Head Ogaden sheep. The parasitological data included numbers of nematode eggs per gram of faeces (EPG), faecal culture L 3 larvae, packed red cell volume (PCV), adult worm and early L 4 counts, and FAMACHA eye-colour score estimates, along with animal performance (body weight change). There were 13 species of nematodes and 4 species of flukes present in the sheep and goats, with Haemonchus contortus being the most prevalent (65 – 80 %), followed by Trichostrongylus spp. The nematode infection levels of both sheep and goats followed the bi-modal annual rainfall pattern, with the highest worm burdens occurring during the two rain seasons (peaks in May and September). There were significant differences in worm burdens between the 4 geographic locations for both sheep and goats. Similar seasonal but not geographical variations occurred in the prevalence of flukes. There were significant correlations between EPG and PCV, EPG and FAMACHA scores, and PCV and FAMACHA scores. Moreover, H. contortus showed an increased propensity for arrested development during the dry seasons. Faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) conducted on the HU flocks, and flocks in surrounding small-holder communities, evaluated the efficacy of commonly used anthelmintics, including albendazole (ABZ), <b>tetramisole</b> (TET), a combination (ABZ + TET) and ivermectin (IVM). Initially, high levels of resistance {{to all of the}} anthelmintics were found in the HU goat flock but not in the sheep. In an attempt to restore the anthelmintic efficacy a new management system was applied to the HU goat flock, including: eliminating the existing parasite infections in the goats, exclusion from the traditional goat pastures, and initiation of communal grazing of the goats with the HU sheep and animals of the local small-holder farmers. Subsequent FECRTs revealed high levels of efficacy of all three drugs in the goat and sheep flocks, demonstrating that anthelmintic efficacy can be restored by exploiting refugia. Individual FECRTs were also conducted on 8 sheep and goat flocks owned by neighbouring small-holder farmers, who received breeding stock from the HU. In each FECRT, 50 local breed sheep and goats, 6 – 9 months old, were divided into 5 treatment groups: ABZ, TET, ABZ + TET, IVM and untreated control. There was no evidence of anthelmintic resistance in the nematodes, indicating that dilution of resistant parasites, which are likely to be imported with introduced breeding goats, and the low selection pressure imposed by the small-holder farmers, had prevented anthelmintic resistance from emerging...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to extend {{existing}} knowledge both {{with respect to the}} mode of action of anthelmintics and the biochemical and physiological mechanisms which may be disrupted by drug action. The helminth species examined include nematodes, Ascaris suum, Ascaridia galli and Trichuris ovis and cestodes, Moniezia, T. hydatigena, T. taeniæformis and Echinoccocus granulosus; the anthelmintics studied were methyridine, diethylcarbamazine, pyrantel, morantel, <b>tetramisole,</b> levamisole, dichlorvos, vincofos, cambendazole and mebendazole. The helminth characteristics selected for most intensive study are (a) the occurrence and properties of helminth cholinesterase and (b) the uptake of glucose. The breadth of the study was limited by the availability of fresh material and not all combinations of helminth and drug were investigated. The histochemical localisation of cholinesterase activity in whole mounts and sections of tapeworms using thiocholine esters revealed a complex network of tegumental receptors feeding a nervous system with efferents to suckers, rostellum and hook muscles. It is suggested that tapeworms have reflex arcsinvolving these structures allowing them to maintain their position in the host intestine in spite of peristaltic action. These arcs are susceptible to anticholinesterase anthelmintics. Other cholinesterase activity is associated with the scolex, cirrus, genital pore and sometimes the tegument. High cholinesterase specific activities against acetylthiocholine were measured in Echinococcus scoleces and tapeworms, but lower levels in nematodes. Differential centrifugation of homogenates was used to study their occurrence in the tissue and facilitate further characterisation. However, the enzyme was widely distributed in these species although somewhat higher in the particulate fractions. Activity was increased little, if any, by attempts to solubilise it with the detergent, Triton X- 100. Cholinesterase in some fractions particularly from T. ovis, had a high temperature optimum around 60 C, but never showed the phenomenon of autoinhibition by substrate at concentrations up to 10 - 2 M. Cholinesterase in species of worm with high levels of enzyme was more sensitive to eserine inhibition than those with lower levels. In studies of glucose uptake from the medium by Ascaris and two tapeworms, it was confirmed that transport into Ascaris was strongly inhibited by certain benzimidazole anthelmintics. Transport into Ascaris, but not the cestodes, was also discovered to be sensitive to local anaesthetics such as procaine or lignocaine. Uptake into tapeworms was inhibited by the absence of sodium ions, phlorizin, iodoacetate and dinitrophenol. It was less inhibited by benzimidazoles and not at all by organophosphate anthelmintics, but was sensitive to phenolic drugs such as hexachlorophene and nitroxynil. In the dog and sheep, a number of anthelmintic drugs administered intravenously showed predominantly nicotinic effects on blood pressure and respiration supporting the cholinergic action of these drugs. Although sheep red-cell cholinesterase is more sensitive to inhibition than that of all helminths tested, the oral route of administration of anthelmintics remains safe for the host and effective against intestinal parasitic worms...|$|E
