In response to recent student violence problems at the William Allen High School, Zahorchak identified one of his priorities as strengthening the district's code of conduct and citizenship programs. He also announced he would seek to replace retiring teachers with highly skilled minority candidates, and would create incentive programs to lure top students into teaching positions if they agreed to spend at least five years teaching in Allentown schools.|$|E
25|$|All medical {{colleges and}} {{universities}} are regulated by the respective provincial department of health.

Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> at the HSC (grades 11–12) and an entrance test like MCAT are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges.|$|E
25|$|Davis used California's growing {{budget surplus}} to {{increase}} education spending. He signed legislation that provided {{for a new}} statewide accountability program and for <b>the</b> <b>Academic</b> <b>Performance</b> Index and supported the high school exit exam. He signed legislation that authorized the largest expansion of the Cal Grant program. Under the Davis administration, California began recognizing students for outstanding academic achievement in math and sciences on the new Golden State Exams.

30|$|Universities play {{a crucial}} role in the {{development}} of a country. <b>The</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> and more efficient use of resources have always been important issues for university top administrators, policy makers, state, faculties, employers, staffs, alumni, and students (Ahn et al. 1988, 1989; Abbott and Doucouliagos 2003; Avkiran 2001; Monfared et al. 2006). In order to assess <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> and <b>the</b> utilization of the resources, it appears that two important issues need to be addressed, i.e., a capable methodology and a set of good performance indicators as we consider in the following.|$|R

40|$|It {{is unknown}} {{to what degree}} single-gender {{classrooms}} relate to the overall student performance, {{when compared to the}} performance of students coming from co-educational school setting. It is thus imperative for educators and parents alike to note whether or not the single-gender classrooms have an effect on <b>academic</b> <b>performance,</b> in order to close the gender gap. This study investigated whether there is any difference between <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> (exam results) of: the students coming from the co-educational classrooms, and the students from the same-gender classrooms. In order to examine this objective, eight schools of Karachi (Pakistan) were selected, among which four schools are co-educational while the other four are singlegender. For this research, Classes 1 till Class 10 were taken into consideration, and the average results are selected for the analysis {{in order to determine the}} relation between the results of the single-gender setting and the coeducational setting. The statistical technique of the Independent Sample Ttest was used in order to examine any significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> (exam results) of the students coming from the two settings. The findings of this research indicated that there are statistically significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performances</b> (exam results); suggesting that on average, students from the single-gender classrooms have a significantly higher mean of exam-performance than do students from the coeducation classrooms. To conclude, the said phenomenon is observed among students, which shows that <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> can be gauged by the level of involvement students have in the class rooms.

25|$|The {{charter schools}} made {{significant}} and sustained gains in student achievement, led by outside operators such as KIPP, the Algiers Charter School Network, and the Capital One – University of New Orleans Charter School Network. An October 2009 assessment demonstrated continued growth in <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> of public schools. Considering {{the scores of}} all public schools in New Orleans gives an overall school district performance score of 70.6. This score represents a 24% improvement over an equivalent pre-Katrina (2004) metric, when a district score of 56.9 was posted. Notably, this score of 70.6 approaches the score (78.4) posted in 2009 by the adjacent, suburban Jefferson Parish public school system, though that system's performance score is itself below the state average of 91.|$|E

25|$|In Pakistan {{a medical}} school {{is more often}} {{referred}} to as a medical college. A medical college is affiliated with a university as a department. There are however several medical universities and medical institutes with their own medical colleges. All medical colleges and universities are regulated by the respective provincial department of health. They however have to be recognized after meeting a set criteria by a central regulatory authority called Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) in Islamabad. There are almost equal number of government and private medical colleges and universities, with their number exceeding 50. Admission to a government medical college is highly competitive. Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> at the college (high school, grades 11-12) level and an entrance test like MCAT are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges. After successfully completing five years of academic and clinical training in the medical college and affiliated teaching hospitals the graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree. The graduates are then eligible to apply for a medical license from the PMDC. A house job of one-year duration is mandatory in a teaching hospital after completing five years of academic and clinical training in the medical college.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>performance</b> and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots {{may be more likely to}} believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E
