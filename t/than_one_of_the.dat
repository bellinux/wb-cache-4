5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} that more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{brothers}} played for Victoria together came in 194647, after Neil was selected {{to play for the}} state against Tasmania. At the time, a second-string team was used to play Tasmaniawho were not in the Sheffield Shieldin two first-class matches, while the strongest team played in the regular interstate competition. Neil struck a century in the second match against Tasmania, and was called into the Victorian team to play against New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, and he played alongside Merv for their state’s three remaining matches of the season. However, the brothers never batted together in these three matches. Merv opened the batting and was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6 upon the fall of the fourth wicket. Merv captained at first-class level {{for the first time in}} the last match, a draw against South Australia that was severely shortened by rain.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo observe <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> low–intensity pulsed {{ultrasound}} in the posterolateral lumbar {{fusion of}} rabbit. MethodsA total of 48 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into the observation group and control group, including the autogenous iliac observation group, artificial bone observation group, artificial bone control group and autogenous iliac control group {{according to the}} different bone grafting. The posterolateral lumbar fusion of rabbits in each group was analyzed and compared. ResultsAfter 4 weeks <b>of</b> treatment using <b>the</b> low–intensity pulsed ultrasound, the fusion in the bone grafting area of observation group was good. There was the relatively dense fusion area between the right transverse process and artificial bone. The left transverse process had been completely fused, with the clear bone trabecula through the fusion area. There was no significant fusion sign in the control group. According to the fusion comparison between two groups, <b>the</b> fusion rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation group was 83. 3 % and it was significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control group (37. 5 %). Results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comparison were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> chondrocytes and <b>the</b> increase in the relative gray–scale in <b>the</b> fusion area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iliac observation group were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iliac control group (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> chondrocytes and <b>the</b> increase in the relative gray–scale in <b>the</b> fusion area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial bone observation group were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial bone control group (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> expression <b>of</b> IL– 1, IL– 6 and IL– 17 4 weeks after <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation group was significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control group, with the statistical significance (P< 0. 05). It indicated that <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> low–intensity pulsed ultrasound could reduce <b>the</b> expression level <b>of</b> inflammatory factors. ConclusionsThe low–intensity pulsed ultrasound can significantly increase the bone grafting fusion rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rabbit's posterolateral lumbar fusion. The possible mechanism is that it promotes the lumbar posterolateral endochondral ossification and reduces the inflammatory reaction...|$|R
