5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. The judge also remarked <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> of public peace, welfare and good order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution. Thus the rationale of maintaining public order behind Order 179 fell within the permitted categories spelt out in both section 24(1)(a) of the SA and Article 15(4) respectively.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the term}} Coast Salish, and its {{association}} with an attribute of nationhood, has increasingly become resisted, as <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> of a ‘national’ grouping is not a traditional part of the culture of Salish communities in this area, and as the term derives more from anthropology than community self-description.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{algorithm}} {{is also used}} to define the notion of decidability. <b>That</b> <b>notion</b> is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report <b>that</b> <b>notions</b> of topological {{protection}} {{can be applied}} to stationary configurations that are driven far from equilibrium by active, dissipative processes. We show this for physically two disparate cases : stochastic networks governed by microscopic single particle dynamics as well as collections of driven, interacting particles described by coarse-grained hydrodynamic theory. In both cases, the presence of dissipative couplings to the environment that break time reversal symmetry are crucial to ensuring topologically protection. These examples constitute proof of principle <b>that</b> <b>notions</b> of topological protection, established in the context of electronic and mechanical systems, do indeed extend generically to processes that operate out of equilibrium. Such topologically robust boundary modes have implications for both biological and synthetic systems. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures (SI: 8 pages 3 figures...|$|R

He started the next two matches against Italy and Denmark, which both ended in draws. Sweden along with Italy and Denmark were in a {{three-way}} tie for the first spot. However, it was concluded that Italy would not advance due to a goal difference after Sweden and Denmark drew 2–2. Italy disputed the decision saying both Sweden and Denmark fixed the match. UEFA squashed <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> and Sweden moved onto the next round to compete against the Netherlands.

Gutiérrez Rodríguez was close associate of Becerra Acosta for several years and previously held the role of general manager at Unomásuno.

Gutiérrez Rodríguez initially tried to conceal Becerra Acosta's exile by claiming that Becerra Acosta had personally chosen him as his successor.

25|$|Poincaré's attempt of a four-dimensional {{reformulation}} {{of the new}} mechanics was not continued by himself, so it was Hermann Minkowski (1907), {{who worked}} out the consequences of <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> (other contributions were made by Roberto Marcolongo (1906) and Richard Hargreaves (1908)). This {{was based on the}} work of many mathematicians of the 19th century like Arthur Cayley, Felix Klein, or William Kingdon Clifford, who contributed to group theory, invariant theory and projective geometry. Using similar methods, Minkowski succeeded in formulating a geometrical interpretation of the Lorentz transformation. He completed, for example, the concept of four vectors; he created the Minkowski diagram for the depiction of space-time; he was the first to use expressions like world line, proper time, Lorentz invariance/covariance, etc.; and most notably he presented a four-dimensional formulation of electrodynamics. Similar to Poincaré he tried to formulate a Lorentz-invariant law of gravity, but that work was subsequently superseded by Einstein's elaborations on gravitation.|$|E

Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.

Lesnar then dared any wrestler who disapproved of <b>that</b> <b>notion</b> to challenge him, which was answered by Mark Henry, and a brawl would ensue, ending with Lesnar delivering an F-5 to Henry. The following week on Raw, Henry challenged Lesnar again, only to have Lesnar dislocate his elbow with the Kimura lock in storyline, which led Big Show to come out afterwards to confront Lesnar, thus starting a feud which was settled at the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014, where Lesnar defeated Show after attacking him with a steel chair before the match began. On the February 24 episode of Raw, after Heyman stated that Lesnar had requested a match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXX, instead receiving an open contract to face anyone else of his choosing, The Undertaker then returned and attacked Lesnar with a chokeslam through a table, setting up their match at WrestleMania XXX.

He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years.
