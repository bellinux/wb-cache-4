5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> and cold front moved eastward. <b>The</b> <b>trough</b> gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of <b>the</b> <b>trough.</b> The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east in response to <b>the</b> <b>trough.</b> Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> into two distinct segments.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind <b>the</b> <b>trough,</b> about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> spiral <b>troughs</b> in <b>the</b> ice cap {{are formed}} by {{katabatic}} winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of <b>the</b> <b>troughs,</b> likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), {{which is then}} redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. <b>The</b> <b>troughs</b> are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. <b>The</b> <b>troughs</b> gradually migrate towards the pole over time; <b>the</b> central <b>troughs</b> have moved about 65km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than <b>the</b> <b>troughs,</b> and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction.|$|R

5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased in association with <b>the</b> <b>trough,</b> {{and the next day}} a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E

40|$|A {{subglacial}} {{drainage network}} underneath the paleo-ice sheet off West Greenland is revealed {{by a new}} compilation of high-resolution bathymetry data from Melville Bay, northeast Baffin Bay. This drainage network is an indicator for ice streaming and subglacial meltwater flow toward the outer shelf. Repeated ice sheet advances and retreats across the crystalline basement together with subglacial meltwater drainage had their impact in eroding overdeepened troughs along ice stream pathways. These overdeepenings indicate {{the location of a}} former ice sheet margin. <b>The</b> <b>troughs</b> inherit characteristics of glacial and subglacial meltwater erosion. Most of <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> follow tectonic weakness zones such as faults and fractures in the crystalline bedrock. Many of these tectonic features correspond with the orientations of major fault axes in the Baffin Bay region. <b>The</b> <b>troughs</b> extend from <b>the</b> present (sub) glacial fjord systems at the Greenland coast and parallel modern outlet-glacier pathways. The fast flowing paleo-ice streams were likely accelerated from the meltwater flow as indicated by glacial landforms within and along <b>the</b> <b>troughs.</b> <b>The</b> ice streams flowed along narrow tributary troughs and merged to form large paleo-ice streams bedded in <b>the</b> major cross-shelf <b>troughs</b> of Melville Bay. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>troughs,</b> a rough seabed topography characterises the bedrock, and we see a sharp geomorphic transition where ice flowed onto sedimentary rock and deposits...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} plate {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California.

40|$|A geomorphological {{description}} of <b>the</b> tectonic <b>troughs</b> behind <b>the</b> volcanic arc is provided from data {{gathered in the}} New Hebrides island arc. From bathymetry and seismic reflection profiles, a representative plan of these troughs is made. From front to rear, the arc sequence is generally a small depression, followed by a wide, deep depression with a narrow ridge along either side. Stratigraphy and tectonics clearly show that <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> were induced by crustal stretching; sedimentary formations observed {{are thought to be}} Plio-Quaternary. Magnetic anomalies on several profiles, and some gravimetric data, show information on the deep structure and genesis of <b>the</b> <b>troughs.</b> We conclude from the data that these recently faulted basins are symmetrical about the longitudinal axis where rising magma is causing uplift. Three possible mechanisms are suggested for the formation of <b>the</b> <b>troughs.</b> <b>The</b> most likely is that transcurrent faults occurred in the curved parts of the arcs, after which convection cells appeared in the asthenosphere above the Benioff zone. The rising columns of the convecting cells caused tensional tectonic movement beneath <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> along pre-existingfault lines.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{elongate}} trough-like features are {{observed in the}} early Quaternary succession of the central North Sea basin. A definitive model of formation for the features remains unclear but <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> may aid {{in our understanding of}} the depositional environment of the early Quaternary. In total, 380 troughs were mapped over 11 [*] 000 [*]km 2 using continuous 3 D seismic data and analysed in conjunction with well log data and understanding of the probable palaeogeographical context. <b>The</b> <b>troughs</b> were formed in a marine setting on the slope of a large clinoform set during a period of rapid progradation. The geometry and infill of <b>the</b> <b>troughs,</b> as well as the marine setting, strongly support a model of repeated density-driven downslope flows which excavate and then infill <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> perpendicular to <b>the</b> strike of the slope. A subset of <b>the</b> <b>troughs</b> are observed to form parallel to the strike {{in such a way that}} cannot be easily explained by downslope processes alone.

5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast {{to avoid making}} landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. <b>The</b> <b>trough</b> caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours.

5|$|In {{the first}} week of December, a westward-moving upper-level low led to the {{formation}} of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge to its northeast, <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> tracked slowly westward, producing scattered convection and some cyclonic turning. On December 8 convection began to persist in association with <b>the</b> <b>trough</b> and an upper-level low. Early on December 9, officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert-Poteat technique, and several tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated its development of tropical characteristics. The system, which consisted of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north, continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures. On December 10 a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its convection had become disorganized and well-removed from the center. Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric, and convection steadily increased closer to the center.
