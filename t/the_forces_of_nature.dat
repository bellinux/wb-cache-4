5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy the Ray Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It was the last resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater wreckage of the Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt the Ray line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute it all over Filgaia, throwing <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> into chaos. It is also revealed {{that one of the}} Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{to see to it that}} his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.|$|E
50|$|During the Dark Reign storyline, Terraformer {{was with}} <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> when Norman Osborn {{recruited}} {{them to the}} Initiative. Upon gaining Sunstreak as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> Terraformer and <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> were assigned to be the superhero team for Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Terraformer {{was with}} <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> when Firebrand II was {{introduced}} as Firewall's replacement. With <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> Terraformer entered <b>the</b> war-torn Trans-Sabal to cause environmental havoc there. Project: Earth enlisted the New Warriors to enter Trans-Sabal {{in order to}} pull <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> out <b>of</b> Trans-Sabal. While Aqueduct killed General Halladan, Terraformer covered Nova in a deadly mold causing Firestar to hurt him badly.|$|R
50|$|However, Project: Earth later {{facilitates}} <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature's</b> {{release and}} retains them as agents, despite the defection of Firewall to the Folding Circle. After recruiting Firebrand II {{as a replacement}} for Firewall, Project: Earth sends <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> to deal with oil well fires in the war-torn nation <b>of</b> Trans-Sabal; when <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> deviates from their assignment and takes a side in Trans-Sabal's ongoing conflict, Project: Earth asks the New Warriors to pull the villains out of the country before their actions further damage the Project's reputation. The Warriors reluctantly agree and eventually succeed in the task (though not before being dragged into the conflict themselves), bringing <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> out for incarceration in the Vault.|$|R
5|$|Strange {{travels to}} Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.|$|E
5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons have already begun to revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E
25|$|The pre-Christian {{religion}} of Lithuania, centred on <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as personified by deities such as Perkūnas (the Thunder God), is experiencing some increased interest. Romuva established a Vilnius branch in 1991.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> first {{appears as}} a team when Project: Earth sends them to stop land {{developers}} from clearing sections of the Amazon rainforest. The original members consisted of Aqueduct, Firewall, Skybreaker, and Terraformer (a creation of Plantman). They come into conflict with the New Warriors when {{several members of the}} Project fake their own disappearances as a publicity stunt; among the missing members is actress Maddie Baldwin, mother of Warriors member Speedball, who asks for his teammates' help in locating her. The trail leads to the Amazon, where the subterfuge is revealed after <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> ambushes and captures the Warriors. Speedball pledges the Warriors' aid in an attempt to get close to his mother, but the heroes turn on <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> when it becomes clear that the villains intend to use lethal <b>force</b> in stopping <b>the</b> clearcutting crews. With <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> on <b>the</b> verge <b>of</b> defeat, Project: Earth abandons them to their fate after an aborted attempt to martyr Maddie Baldwin and blame the developers (foiled by Speedball). <b>The</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> is turned over to local authorities for incarceration.|$|R
25|$|In Vedic literature, Devas and Devis {{represent}} <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{and some}} represent moral values (such as the Adityas, Varuna, and Mitra), each symbolizing {{the epitome of}} a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (Siddhis).|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form haiku and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was {{published}} (Haiku: This Other World) with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton placed great {{faith in}} the concept of an unadulterated, pure, ancient doctrine, which he studied vigorously to aid his {{understanding}} of the physical world. Many of Newton's manuscripts—most of which are still unpublished—detail his thorough study of the Corpus Hermeticum, writings said to have been transmitted from ancient times, in which the secrets and techniques of influencing the stars and <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> were revealed, i.e. As Above, So Below.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of understanding such transformation is {{it provides a}} more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, {{as well as other}} ecological settings, as places where indigenous populations have dealt with <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an environment, not a society. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of anthropogenic transformation of both waterways and landscapes.|$|E
25|$|David Hume (26 April 1711 - 25 August 1776), a Scottish naturalist, empiricist, and skeptic, {{argued for}} naturalism and against belief in God. He argued that order stems from both design and natural processes, {{so it is}} not {{necessary}} to infer a designer when one sees order; that the design argument, even if it worked, would not support a robust or even moral God, that the argument begged the question of the origin of God, and that design was merely a human projection onto <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> did {{not appear}} as a full team for some time {{following}} the Trans-Sabal incident, {{and most of the}} membership was shown returning to criminal activity. Aqueduct (who kept his new alias and costume after <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> separated) in particular was active {{as a member of the}} seventh incarnation of the Masters of Evil, and more recently as one of the villains recruited for government service by the Thunderbolts during Marvel Comics' Civil War event. Firewall/Silk Fever also appeared as a Thunderbolts recruit along with her Folding Circle teammates.|$|R

25|$|The Egyptian word written m3ˁt, often {{rendered}} maat or ma'at, {{refers to}} the fundamental order of the universe in Egyptian belief. Established at {{the creation of the}} world, maat distinguishes the world from the chaos that preceded and surrounds it. Maat encompasses both the proper behavior of humans and the normal functioning of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> both of which make life and happiness possible. Because the actions of the gods govern natural forces and myths express those actions, Egyptian mythology represents the proper functioning {{of the world and the}} sustenance of life itself.|$|E
25|$|Discovering Britain is {{a website}} {{featuring}} {{a series of}} self-led geographical walks that help explain the stories behind the UK's built and natural landscapes. Each walk explores a particular landscape, finding out about {{the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> people, events and the economy have created and shaped the area. There are now more than 120 walks on the Discovering Britain website, covering all regions of the United Kingdom. Walks are themed according to the landscape in which they are located, including built, prehistoric, historic, working, hidden and changing landscapes. Walks also look at people in the landscape, and shaping, preserving and exploiting the landscape.|$|E
25|$|Vodun {{cosmology}} {{centers around}} the vodun spirits and other elements of divine essence that govern the Earth, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and human society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodun, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or nation. The vodun are the center of religious life, similar in many ways to doctrines such as the intercession of saints and angels that made Vodun appear compatible with Christianity, especially Catholicism, and produced syncretic religions such as Haitian Vodou. Adherents also emphasize ancestor worship and hold that {{the spirits of the}} dead live {{side by side with the}} world of the living, each family of spirits having its own female priesthood, sometimes hereditary when it's from mother to blood daughter.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} {{accident}} {{on the line}} occurred {{on the night of}} 22 June 2003, when a landslide caused an express train travelling from Karwar to Mumbai to derail at the entrance to a tunnel. Fifty-one people {{died as a result of}} the accident, and several others were injured. As a result of the accident, the corporation came under heavy criticism for failing to adhere to adequate safety measures in the landslide-prone region. An inquiry revealed the cause of the accident to be a failure of a cutting due to absence of monsoon patrolling. The findings were disputed by the corporation, which insisted that the lack of monsoon patrolling did not lead to the accident which was entirely a result of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Shortly after the accident, the corporation announced that it would enhance safety measures on the route.|$|E

A similar heist happens over Mexico where the criminals unload {{millions of dollars in}} bills over Mexico, then disappear into the Cave of Swallows. Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France.

25|$|While some Baras are Christians, most {{retain their}} {{traditional}} religious beliefs. Tamarind trees were traditionally considered sacred and are found planted near many Bara villages, where residents will leave offerings like woven mats, locks of hair, shells {{and other items}} when offering prayers or after their requests are fulfilled. The indigenous bontona tree was also considered sacred and villagers would tie charms to the branches when offering prayers. Each village also had a hazomanga, a wooden pillar considered the most sacred site of worship, which served as the public altar for group prayer and offerings. This pillar was typically 20 to 30 feet high and a sachet containing sacred herbs, sand and wood chips was hung from the top. Bara men traditionally conduct the rites associated with honoring the ancestors, while women conduct rites associated with fertility and <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> An exception is childbirth, during which the mother is secluded {{for a period of}} four days; men watch over the birthing process and conduct associated rites.|$|E
