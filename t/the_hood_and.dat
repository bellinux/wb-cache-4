5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{collaborated with}} other {{companies}} to produce Halo-themed merchandise and promotions at retailers and vendors.

Burger King announced a special promotion starting September 24, 2007 featuring Halo designs and characters on food wrappings. Microsoft sponsored the #40 car driven by David Stremme for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Dover 400 Nextel Cup Series.

5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> <b>and</b> Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and both now points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E

25|$|The wheels {{were soon}} {{replaced}} by an alloy five-spoke design with Goodyear white-letter tires. <b>The</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> roof were repainted a contrasting dark blue.

25|$|After {{this bit}} of fun to warm up the crowd the Sway Hood is then thrown up in the air.

25|$|In folklore, when {{a custom}} {{is too old}} for its origins to be remembered, a story is often devised to rationalise what would {{otherwise}} be baffling. However the ‘official’ story of the Hood's origins are not that unlikely. There are parallels between <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> <b>and</b> bog burials in Europe. The game takes place {{on the border of}} bogs where naturally-preserved mummies of prehistoric sacrifices have been found.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the center-mounted instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> the road ahead.|$|E

25|$|A {{roof rack}} {{is a common}} trait on many SUV and station wagon vehicles. While roof racks are very useful in {{carrying}} extra storage on a vehicle, they also increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the drag coefficient. This is because as the air flows {{over the top of}} the vehicle, following the smooth lines of <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> windshield, then collides with the roof rack and causes turbulence. The removal of this part has led to increases in fuel efficiency in several studies.|$|E
25|$|The game ends {{when the}} Hood arrives {{at one of}} the pubs and is touched by the {{landlord}} from his front step. The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> <b>and</b> then hangs it behind the bar (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on a spit over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.|$|E
25|$|Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had {{the widest}} front {{seats in the}} industry. The Weather Eye heating and {{ventilation}} with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems under <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> the price of only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.|$|E

25|$|Carbon fiber {{is used on}} the roof, hood, fenders, front {{splitter}}, and rocker moldings; <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> fenders {{are painted}} over, while the roof and splitter are merely covered in a clear-coat, retaining their black color.

The wheels are the largest ever placed on a production Corvette, with both front and rear wheels increasing in size and diameter over the Corvette Z06. Carbon-ceramic brakes are included. The brake calipers are painted blue, as are the engine intercooler trim and the ZR1 logo. Magnetic Selective Ride Control is also included on the car, with sensors to automatically adjust stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle movement.|$|E
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). <b>The</b> <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production.|$|E
