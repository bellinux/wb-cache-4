5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E
