5|$|On 11 July, NATO {{prepared}} for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, {{the first wave of}} the assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported <b>this</b> <b>back</b> to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end to the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from <b>this</b> <b>back</b> hallway.|$|E

25|$|A major {{industrial}} application for copper(II) chloride is as a co-catalyst with palladium(II) chloride in the Wacker process. In this process, ethene (ethylene) {{is converted to}} ethanal (acetaldehyde) using water and air. During the reaction, PdCl2 is reduced to Pd, and the CuCl2 serves to re-oxidize <b>this</b> <b>back</b> to PdCl2. Air can then oxidize the resultant CuCl back to CuCl2, completing the cycle.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{and some}} other European countries, the {{pneumatic}} two-tone (hi-lo) siren consists of two sets of air horns, one high pitched and the other low pitched. An air compressor blows the air into one set of horns, and then it automatically switches to the other set. As <b>this</b> <b>back</b> and forth switching occurs, the sound changes tones. Its sound power varies, but could get as high as approximately 125dB, depending on the compressor and the horns. Comparing with the mechanical sirens, it uses much less electricity but needs more maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Parachartergus fraternus feeds {{primarily}} on caterpillars of Lepidoptera. They eat the adults and larvae of this species. Usually, adult wasps find prey, subdue it, chew {{it up and}} bring <b>this</b> <b>back</b> to feed the others. The whole prey is not brought back at once but in small masticated chunks. Wasps also consume nectar and honeydew that has been collected by foragers. This is usually stored in viscous drops inside the cells within the nest. Honeydew is usually obtained from insects of the family Aetalionidae, while water is found all around the environment.|$|E
25|$|The German Spring Offensive {{in early}} 1918 saw them gain a {{considerable}} amount of ground as the Allies were forced back. During this time, the 35th Battalion was dispatched to defend the town of Amiens, taking up positions around Villers-Bretonneux. As the German onslaught began to run out of steam, the Australians launched a counter-attack at Hangard Wood on 30 March 1918. On 4 April, the Germans made another attempt at taking Villers-Bretonneux, and the 35th Battalion was heavily engaged in turning <b>this</b> <b>back.</b> Casualties during this time were heavy, consisting of an estimated 70 per cent of the battalion's strength. On 8 August 1918, the Allies launched their own offensive, the Hundred Days Offensive, and the 35th was again committed to the fighting around Amiens. Following this they were involved in several engagements as Allied forces advanced towards the defences of the Hindenburg Line. Their final involvement in the war came in September when the battalion was called upon to provide reinforcements for the joint Australian–American operations to breach the German line.|$|E
25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in <b>this</b> <b>back</b> room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over {{all the money in}} the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin to talk about their pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E

25|$|At Wimbledon, Davenport was the {{top seed}} and made it easily to the fourth round, where she was tested again by Clijsters, but came through in three sets to win her second {{successive}} match against the Belgian. Davenport then reached the semifinals, where her match against Amélie Mauresmo was interrupted by rain and was completed {{over the course of}} two days. Davenport eventually defeated Mauresmo and faced 14th-seeded Venus Williams in an all-American final. Davenport led most of the way, as she served for the match at 6–5 in the second set, and had a match point at 5–4 in the third set. Williams went on to win, 4–6, 7–6, 9–7, in the longest (in terms of time) women's Wimbledon final in history. In that match, Davenport sustained a serious back injury while leading 4–2 (40–15) in the final set, although she acknowledged after the match that the injury did not cause her defeat and that Williams was the superior mentally strong player on the day. The injury forced Davenport to withdraw from Fed Cup competition. She returned to the tour at the Stanford tournament. After reinjuring her back in a warmup just hours before her match, Davenport retired while trailing 0–5 in the first set. <b>This</b> <b>back</b> injury then forced her to withdraw from other hard-court events in San Diego and Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Following {{this the}} 8thDivision was {{deployed}} to defend Singapore's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore {{most of the}} division's units were at half-strength, and the replacements that had been received—a draft of about 1,900 replacements was sent in late January—were barely trained, some having as little as two weeks' training in Australia before being dispatched. [...] Assigned larger-than-normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill-suited for defence, the 22nd and 27th Brigades were spread thin {{on the ground with}} large gaps in their lines. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18thDivision to defend this sector. Nevertheless, on 8February the Japanese landed in the Australian sector, and the 8thDivision was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. A subsequent landing took place at Kranji, but the division was unable to turn <b>this</b> <b>back</b> and subsequently withdrew to the centre of the island.|$|E
500|$|Musical duels {{between the}} two sides were common, as they heard each other as the music {{traveled}} across the countryside. [...] The night before the Battle of Stones River, bands from both sides dueled with separate songs until both sides started playing Home! Sweet Home!, at which time soldiers on both sides started singing together as one. [...] A similar situation occurred in Fredericksburg, Virginia in the winter of 18623. [...] On a cold afternoon, a Union band started playing Northern patriotic tunes; a Southern band responded by playing Southern patriotic tunes. [...] <b>This</b> <b>back</b> and forth continued into the night, until at the end both sides played Home! Sweet Home! simultaneously, to the cheers of both sides' forces. [...] In a third instance, in the spring of 1863, the opposing armies were on the opposite sides of the Rappahannock River in Virginia, when the different sides played their patriotic tunes, and at taps one side played Home! Sweet Home!, and the other joined in, creating [...] "cheers" [...] from both sides that echoed throughout the hilly countryside.|$|E
500|$|When echolocating, {{the sperm}} whale emits a directionally focused beam of {{broadband}} clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through {{a pair of}} phonic lips (also known as [...] "monkey lips" [...] or [...] "museau de singe") at {{the front end of}} the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it. Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose, where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time. <b>This</b> <b>back</b> and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure. This multi-pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale's spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks. Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale's click is unique to that individual. [...] However, if the whale matures and the size of the spermaceti organ increases, the tone of the whale's click will also change. The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{introduced}} with a narrative by Minaj, speaking in an English accent, {{that serves as}} a retelling of writer Roald Dahl's poetic rework of [...] "Cinderella". West begins his verse with the refrain [...] "I fantasized ’bout <b>this</b> <b>back</b> in Chicago". It introduces themes referenced on the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, including comments on decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until the pain was over / but what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?". His lyrics on the track contain numerous musical and cultural references, including those to the song [...] "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the band the Kings Of Leon and their song [...] "Sex on Fire", singers Celine Dion and Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel. The song contains the line [...] "too many Urkels on your team / that's why your wins low", a double entendre. The [...] "Winslows" [...] were the family Urkel lived with on the show Family Matters, with the alternative meaning touching upon how his opponents' [...] "wins are low". The chorus contains the line [...] "can we get much higher?", another inquiry that is brought up during much of the proceeding album.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "just about perfect", writing: [...] "this {{was one of}} those high-energy episodes that narrowed its song focus [...] and found a just-right mix of cynicism and optimism, of banal reality and glam performance." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "It's been a long premiere season of ups and downs, and this last show is a warm embrace that — let’s face it — you just don't want to let go." [...] The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson deemed the episode [...] "awesome", observing: [...] "While it was light on the usual humor, it was heavy on emotion, and I think that's ideal for a season finale. Glee ended its freshman season with a real wallop that took a couple of unexpected turns before pulling nicely into a satisfying finish." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "A-", deeming it among the best of the entire season. He felt that: [...] "On its own, 'Journey to Regionals' is a fantastic episode of Glee. As a capper to the season, it mostly works." [...] While VanDerWerff had some issues with the episode, including Shelby's sudden decision to adopt Beth, he summarized that: [...] "for once in <b>this</b> <b>back</b> nine, the good stuff absolutely overwhelms the stupid stuff." [...] Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News felt that: [...] "Glee wrapped up on a high note, leaving some of the season's less-appealing plotlines behind and heading towards the promise of more performances and more amazing Sue Sylvester one-liners next season." ...|$|E

[...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout <b>this</b> <b>back</b> in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E
