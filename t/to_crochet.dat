2500|$|In the 19th century, as Ireland {{was facing}} the Great Irish Famine (1845-1849), crochet lace work was {{introduced}} {{as a form}} of famine relief (the production of crocheted lace being an alternative way of making money for impoverished Irish workers). Men, women, children joined a cooperative in order <b>to</b> <b>crochet</b> and produce products to help with famine relief during the Great Irish Famine. Schools to teach crocheting were started. Teachers were trained and sent across Ireland to teach this craft. When the Irish immigrated to the Americas, they were able to take with them crocheting. [...] Mademoiselle Riego de la Blanchardiere is generally credited with the invention of Irish Crochet, publishing the first book of patterns in 1846. Irish lace became popular in Europe and America, and was made in quantity until the first World War.|$|E
2500|$|Yarns {{can be made}} of two, three, four, or more plies, or {{may be used as}} singles without plying. Two-ply yarn {{can also}} be plied from both ends of one long strand of singles using a centre-pull ball, where one end feeds from within a ball of yarn while the other end feeds from the outside. [...] So-called [...] "Andean" [...] plying, in which the single is first wound around one hand in a {{specific}} manner that allows unwinding both ends at once without tangling, is another way to ply smaller amounts of yarn. [...] The name comes from a method used by Andean spinners to manage and splice unevenly matched singles being plied from multiple spindles. [...] "Navajo" [...] (aka [...] "chain-") plying is another method of producing a three-ply yarn, in which one strand of singles is looped around itself in a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>crochet</b> and the resulting three parallel strands twisted together. This method is often used to keep colours together on singles dyed in sequential colours. Cabled yarns are usually four-ply yarns made by plying two strands of two-ply yarn together in the direction opposite to the plying direction for the two-ply yarns.|$|E

5000|$|Most bead crochet {{is created}} by {{stringing}} beads onto uncut <b>crochet</b> thread prior <b>to</b> <b>crocheting.</b> Most artists either use a beading needle or apply clear nail polish {{to the end of}} the thread to create an anchor point for beading. At predetermined stitches, the crocheter slides one bead down and incorporates it into the fabric. Pre-stringing requires both the bead sequence and the <b>crochet</b> pattern <b>to</b> be fully planned in advance of manufacture. This technique aligns beads on one side of the stitch. So crocheting in rounds naturally yields a bead side and a crochet side. Projects that are worked in rows would either have beads on both sides of the fabric or have alternating bead and non-bead rows.|$|R

50|$|Navajo plying (also {{known as}} chain plying) {{consists}} of making large loops, similar <b>to</b> <b>crocheting.</b> Only one single is necessary, {{and if the}} single is already dyed, this technique allows it to be plied without ruining the color scheme. The spinner first makes an 8-inch (200 mm) loop through the loop {{on the end of}} the leader. (A leader is the string left on the bobbin, which the new yarn is spun from.) Then the spinner starts spinning all three strands together in the opposite direction than that they were spun in. When only 2 to 3 in remain of the loop, a new, 7-inch (180 mm) loop of yarn is pulled through the loop, and spinning continues. This process is repeated until the yarn is all plied. This technique allows the spinner to try to match up thick and thin spots in the yarn, thus making for a smoother end product.|$|R
50|$|Once {{she began}} production, Francine learned {{about a group}} of women that were {{involved}} in the Rwandan genocide that had been raped and contracted HIV/AIDS.

This marked the beginning of Same Sky's production, and it has sold over 45,000 pieces of jewelry since.|$|E
50|$|In knitting, {{the use of}} two needles, the knitter {{must learn}} to use both needles seamlessly. Several factors also lead to ambidexterity, the first one being if a person either favors their left hand over their right or if they learned <b>to</b> <b>crochet</b> before {{learning}} to knit. In that case, they either use the Continental method (yarn in left hand, work moving from left needle to right needle; sometimes called 'picking') or the English method (yarn held in right hand, work still moving {{from left to right}} needle; sometimes called 'throwing' and more common in the United States.) For colour work both methods can be used at the same time.|$|E
50|$|This {{knitting}} {{style is}} often easier to learn {{for people with}} crocheting experience, since the way the yarn is held in the left hand is similar <b>to</b> <b>crochet,</b> and {{the motion of the}} right hand is similar to the motion seen in crochet, although the knitting needle is held under the palm of the hand. One major difference in the motion of the right wrist is that in crochet the crochet hook may be held more like a pencil; this method of holding the knitting needle like a pencil was briefly made popular around 1900 under the guise of being more ladylike. Nowadays, however, the majority of knitters hold both needles under the palm.|$|E
5000|$|Doilies figure {{prominently}} in the custom of finger bowls, once common in formal, multi-course dinners. The linen doily (never paper) separates the dessert plate from the finger bowl. The custom requires that both doily and finger bowl are removed to the upper left of the place setting before briefly dipping fingertips {{into the water and}} drying them on the napkin. Failing to move both together is a faux pas. [...] Disposable paper doilies [...] "were designed as a cheaper but respectable alternative <b>to</b> <b>crocheted</b> linen doilies" [...] and are commonly used to decorate plates, placed under the food for ornamentation. In the UK, [...] "sales rocketed in the 1950s as a reaction to post-war austerity and the doily quickly became a symbol of upward social mobility." [...] However, the UK is currently experiencing a decline, prompting a [...] "Save our Doilies" [...] campaign. Once [...] "a symbol of suburban gentility" [...] they are now perceived as outdated.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>crocheting.</b> Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
