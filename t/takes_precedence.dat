5|$|Metroid Prime is a first-person action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It {{was released in}} North America on November 17, 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics. Because exploration <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. On {{the same day as}} its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994).|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} aimed {{to present the}} {{standard}} operatic repertoire, sung in English, and has staged all the major operas of Mozart, Wagner and Puccini, and {{a wide range of}} Verdi's operas. Under Mackerras and his successors the Czech repertoire has featured strongly, and a broad range of French and Russian operas has been presented. The company has for decades laid stress on opera as drama, and has avoided operas where vocal display <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> over musical and dramatic content. In addition to the operatic staples, ENO has a history of presenting new works, and latterly of commissioning them.|$|E

5|$|The {{succession}} {{order is}} determined by primogeniture in most European monarchies. Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom now adhere to absolute primogeniture, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne, regardless of gender; Monaco and Spain have the older system of male-preference primogeniture, while Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture. In 1990, Norway granted absolute primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> {{in the line of}} succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway continues to take precedence over his older sister.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
5|$|When {{displayed}} alongside other flags, {{the national}} flag takes {{the position of}} honour; it is raised first and lowered last. Other national flags should be arranged in alphabetical order. Where two (or more than three) flags appear together, the national flag should be placed to the right (left of the observer); in a display of three flags in line, the national flag occupies the central position. The European flag is also flown from government buildings on a daily basis. In {{the presence of a}} foreign visitor belonging to a member state, this <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> over the Italian flag. As a sign of mourning, flags flown externally shall be lowered to half-mast; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed. Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a golden fringe surrounding the perimeter.|$|E

As such, {{when it is}} displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name <b>takes</b> <b>precedence.</b> Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{nomenclatural}} {{problems with the}} current use of the name Pachylemur. First, Filhol had himself used the name Pachylemur in 1874 {{for a group of}} primitive primates, including Adapis, that he considered intermediate between pachyderms and lemurs. Several other authors mentioned this name in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is questionable that any rendered the name available under the rules of zoological nomenclature. Still, this name potentially renders Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, invalid under the Principle of Homonymy. In addition, the generic name Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, predates Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, by half a century and thus <b>takes</b> <b>precedence</b> under the Principle of Priority, and Pachylemur Lamberton is itself unavailable because Lamberton failed to select a type species. To conserve the name Pachylemur, Jelle Zijlstra, Colin Groves, and Alex Dunkel submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 2011. The petition asks the Commission to suppress the names Pachylemur Filhol, 1874, Pachylemur Palmer, 1904 (based on Filhol's name), and Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, and to make Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, retroactively available with Lemur insignis as its type species.|$|E
