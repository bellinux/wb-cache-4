5|$|Madgwick's {{second term}} as {{chairman}} expired on 30 June 1973 and {{he hoped to}} be extended for a third. McClelland, however, told Madgwick in early 1973 that Whitlam was concerned about Madgwick's age and therefore planned to replace him. Privately, Madgwick felt that Whitlam wanted him replaced because Whitlam suspected Madgwick and his vice-chairman of being biased in favour of the previous government. Madgwick, as with Darling, was not officially informed that would be replaced as chairman until shortly before his term expired. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>chairman</b> was Richard Downing, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and a Labor supporter.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 1953, Stalin's {{death was}} announced, {{as was the}} new leadership. Malenkov was <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who {{consolidated}} his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee. The New York Times listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.|$|E

5|$|Radyr Cricket Club {{was founded}} in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth, who granted a hundred-year lease for the current {{riverside}} ground to the local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team were away on tour. Under the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> Keith Terry, a huge fund-raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of the old one in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the South Wales Premier Cricket League.|$|E
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>chairman</b> John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of a}} new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's {{removal from}} office, rumours started {{circulating}} within the top circles, {{and on the}} streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Chairman</b> of the Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the stagnant Soviet economy.|$|E

5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>chairman</b> of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Theo Paphitis {{announced}} that he was stepping down as chairman of the club with Jeff Burnige to replace him from May 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, manager Dennis Wise {{announced that}} he was leaving as he was unable to form a working relationship with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>chairman.</b> Former Millwall striker Steve Claridge was announced as the new player-manager of Millwall. However, when Burnige then stepped down just two months after taking up the post, it was announced on 27 July that Claridge had been sacked after just 36 days, without ever taking charge of the team in a competitive match. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Colin Lee replaced him but lasted only five months in charge of the club. On 21 December, with the club bottom of the Championship, he became the club's Director of Football and was replaced as manager by 32-year-old player Dave Tuttle, on a short-term contract {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. Tuttle had no prior experience in football management. In February 2006, Lee left the club altogether. Millwall experienced a difficult season, having had four managers in 2005. Their 13 goals scored at home was the second worst in Football League history. Their relegation to League One was confirmed on 17 April 2006 with a 2–0 loss against Southampton. In the closed season Nigel Spackman was appointed as the new manager, but he lasted only four months after a string of bad results. In September 2006, Theo Paphitis (chairman from 1997 to 2005) ended his nine-year association with the club after a year-long spell as a non-executive director. On 19 March 2007, Willie Donachie signed a two-year contract following some progress which had seen the club climb to 11th place in the league. Before Donachie took charge, Millwall had taken only six points from their first ten games. In the 2007–08 season Millwall sat bottom of the table at the beginning of October. Donachie was sacked on 8 October, with Richard Shaw and Colin West becoming caretaker managers.|$|E
