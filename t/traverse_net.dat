The name was {{traditionally}} used in Christian sources throughout history {{and is still}} widely used as an international tourism concept to define a region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by fairy chimneys and a unique historical and cultural heritage. The term, as used in tourism, roughly correspondsto present-day Nevşehir Province. Dating back to 4000 BC; the earliest people {{used to live in}} Goreme known as Cappadocia, in dwellings dug into the rock. Christianity came to the region, and were constructed a lot of chapels, churches and monasteries. Saint Theodoros Trion church is also one of them and biggest one.

40|$|Encryption {{is one of}} the Essential {{security}} {{technologies for}} computer data, and it {{will go a long way}} toward securing information. The unauthorized thefts in our society have made the requirement for reliable information security mechanisms. Even though information security can be accomplished with the help of a prevailing tool like cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the cryptographic keys {{is one of the}} significant issues to be deal with. Here we proposed a biometric-crypto system which generates a cryptographic key from the Finger prints for encrypting and decrypting the information the popular biometric used to authenticate a person is fingerprint which is unique and permanent through out a person’slife. Hence, the biometric is gone eternally and possibly for all the applications. If your information <b>traverses</b> on <b>net</b> to reach destination a number of attacks may be done. To protect from attacks we proposed a system which will encrypt the data using AES with biometric based key generation technique...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} intermediate handling of multicast data while it <b>traverses</b> the <b>net</b> from a multicast source to its receivers. The proposed concept of dynamic manycasting hierarchies is a fusion of both multicast and anycast methodologies. The concept {{is designed to be}} transparent and does not require any modications to be made to the existing multicast and anycast delivery protocols. By adding a distributed intermediate entity that keeps track of receivers and dynamically selects the best way to deliver multicast data we not only achieve faster data delivery and higher level of security, but also provide a framework for future protocol extensions and added functionality without making any global changes to the multicasting protocols themselves. In particular, manycasting hierarchies address the problem of having anycast addresses as members of multicast groups, shifting the load from a multicast source.

The introduced model is based on token machines in which not one but multiple tokens are allowed to <b>traverse</b> the underlying <b>net</b> at the same time. We prove soundness and adequacy of the introduced model. The former is proved as a simulation result between the token machines one obtains along any reduction sequence. The latter is obtained by a fine analysis of convergence, both in nets and in token machines...|$|R
50|$|Reward Challenge: In a {{challenge}} {{based on the}} four classical elements, the castaways would start by scaling a wall and <b>traverse</b> a cargo <b>net.</b> They would then run to a mud pit, retrieve at least three rings of the same color (red or yellow), emerge from the pit, walk over a bed of hot coals and shoot the rings to a pole. When the reserve of rings ran out, they {{could go back to}} the mud pit and retrieve at least another ring to repeat the process. Once three rings had been shot to the pole, they would then run to a platform and raise a flag. First two to raise their flag would win.|$|R
50|$|Reward Challenge: The contestants {{go through}} an {{obstacle}} course that uses elements from past challenges. Starting from inside a cage, they dig out from under it, then <b>traverse</b> a <b>net</b> wall. The first four to traverse the wall and head to their mats then each eat a fruit bat in exchange for ten stones, {{to be used to}} break or topple three plates; if the ten stones run out with plates still standing, they have to eat another bat to have another ten stones and so on until all three plates are broken. Then, they each enter a maze to gather eight Palauan state flags, exit the maze and match those flags, as well as eight other flags, to their respective state names. A cheatboard some distance away from the flag stations is presented for guidance. The first two to correctly match their flags then hop over a tire obstacle course towards a sand pit in search of a rai stone. Then, they go through a command crawl toward a second sand pit to retrieve another rai stone. The rai stones would be used as counterweights for a battering ram, which would be used to smash a brick wall at the end. The one who smashes their wall first wins the reward.|$|R

This paper describes the analysis of acoustic data gathered during this haul and {{a survey of the}} immediate vicinity, in order to characterise an acoustic signature that may be used to identify this species of squid. Distinctive echoes that did not occur when other, unsuccessful hauls were undertaken, were the only strong echoes recorded from the part of the water column <b>traversed</b> by the <b>net.</b> The trawl was restricted to a single depth zone which reduced the potential number of echoes that might otherwise have been attributed to the squid that were caught...|$|R
30|$|After {{completing}} this work, we {{were informed}} by John McCuan {{of an earlier}} paper [5] in which some of the material relates closely {{to the topic of}} the present study. Our contribution can be regarded as an improvement on Section 4 of [5], {{in the sense that we}} study the question in the context of the fully nonlinear equations, in preference to the linearization adopted in that reference. The particular geometry of the configuration permits us to integrate the equations explicitly in original form, yielding expressions that describe general physical laws. Beyond the evident improvements in precision and detail, we were led to the discovery that the net attracting (repelling) force on the plates is independent of the contact angles that occur on their outer sides; thus the restriction made in [5] to plates with identical angles on the two sides is superfluous. We find also the general theorem that the net force is repelling or attracting, according as the (extended) solution curve joining the plates in a vertical section does or does not contain a zero for the height on its <b>traverse,</b> the <b>net</b> force being then provided respectively by the elementary formulas (1.9) or (1.8). We obtain additionally a more complete description of the limiting behavior as given plates approach each other (this behavior becomes dramatically singular for solutions close to the symmetric one; see Section  5 of the present work).|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} of hypertext, in which text is {{augmented}} with a fine-grained semantic net representation of the text, solves several problems found in traditional hypertext models. In the new model, hypertext links are paths that originate in the text, move across to the semantic <b>net,</b> <b>traverse</b> a subpath through the semantic net, then return to a different point in the text. Benefits of the model include a strong semantics for links, dynamic discovery of links, link reusability, and automatic creation of links. The SNITCH hypertext system, {{which is based on}} this model, allows a user to access data in ways never foreseen by the hypertext author.

40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in {{natural laminar flow}} (NLF) has rekindled designers' concerns that manufacturing deviations, (loss of surface contours or other surface imperfections) may destroy the effectiveness of NLF for an operational airplane. This paper reports on experimental research that compares predicted and measured boundary layer transition, total drag, and two-dimensional drag coefficients for three different wing surface conditions on an airplane typical of general aviation manufacturing technology. The three flight test phases included: (1) assessment of an unpainted airframe, (2) flight tests of the same airplane after painstakingly filling and sanding the wings to design contours, and (3) similar measurements after this airplane was painted. In each flight phase, transition locations were monitored using either sublimating chemicals or pigmented oil. As expected, total drag changes were difficult to measure. Two-dimensional drag coefficients were estimated using the Eppler-Somers code and measured with a wake rake in a method very similar to Jones' pitot <b>traverse</b> method. The <b>net</b> change in two-dimensional drag was approximately 20 counts between the unpainted airplane and the 'hand-smoothed' airplane for typical cruise flight conditions...|$|R

In particular, manycasting hierarchies address the problem of having anycast addresses as members of multicast groups, shifting the load from a multicast source. Since there is a number of servers that replicate the data from a source there are also less failures caused by congestion and routing problems. Another important factor is that the transmission of data to end-clients is not limited to multicast per se, and can be done based on an end-client's requet using various protocols, including unicast, broadcast, and reliable multicast. Finally, by using interim source hopping, where various parts of a multicast message are being received by a client from different sources, a potentially high level of security can be achieved. Since the manycasting hierarchy that performs an extra security function on multicast data knows about its end-clients, {{it is much easier to}} provide verification and authentication and it is no longer necessary to utilize complex reliable multicast disciplines that would otherwise be used by an end-client to talk to a multicast source...|$|R

40|$|We used remote-sensing and in situ {{measurements}} of surface accumulation rate, ice surface velocity, thickness and elevation {{to evaluate the}} mass budgets of grounded ice-flow regimes that form the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf system. Three distinct drainage regimes are considered: the western and eastern margins of the ice shelf, and the southern grounding line at the major outlet glacier confluence, which can be identified with drainage zones 9, 11 and 10 respectively of Giovinetto and Zwally (2000). Our findings show the entire grounded portion of the basin is approximately in balance, with a mass budget of - 4. 2 _ 9. 8 Gt a- 1. Drainages 9, 10 and 11 are within balance {{to the level of}} our measurement uncertainty, with mass budgets of - 2. 5 _ 2. 8 Gt a- 1, - 2. 6 _ 7. 8 Gt a- 1 and 0. 9 _ 2. 3 Gt a- 1, respectively. The region upstream of the Australian Lambert Glacier basin (LGB) <b>traverse</b> has a <b>net</b> mass budget of 4. 4 _ 6. 3 Gt a- 1, while the downstream region has - 8. 9 _ 9. 9 Gt a- 1.

40|$|The usages of Remotely Operated Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (ROVs') for {{inspection}} of marine structures is today {{an essential part}} of the offshore industry. However, in the case of inspection of fish farms, the ROV has to spend continuous time relatively close to the water surface, in exposed seas, while navigating irregular flexible fish nets. The ability for an ROV to effectively navigate within the fish farm cage and guarantee a complete inspection requires new tools, and dynamic positioning (DP) improvements. This thesis will use the simulation tool FHSim to investigate two aspects regarding these issues. First, it will examine, by simulations, the performance of different variations of a nonlinear observer and an extended kalman filter (EKF) with or without a cascaded current observer, in the ROV's operating conditions. Secondly a visualization tool is integrated with the ROV DP system that allows it to <b>traverse</b> the fish <b>net</b> autonomously while also visualizing its position in the cage. The visualization module also identifies net areas that have been inspected by the ROV. All the modified DP modules are assessed in several simulation cases designed to mimic ROV inspection behaviour. It was found that in particular, the nonlinear observer performed better in estimation and wave filtering abilities, while the EKF was superior in dead reckoning. These differences were attributed to the different nature of the two observers, their programmed integration method, and possibly insufficient tuning of the EKF. The autonomous net traversal algorithm was successfully able to make the ROV traverse the cage, however, some trajectory faults were identified. Improvements to overcome these faults were suggested...|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} stunt, only Manuel and Jommy {{accomplished}} the stunt; Manuel did his in 26 seconds, while Jommy finished it in 34 seconds, both {{even faster than}} the previous world Fear Factor record of 36 seconds by a contestant of Frente al Miedo, the Colombian version of the franchise. Among the men, the two were joined by RJ in advancing to the second stunt. RJ reached the third yellow line on the net in 17 seconds; Marion fell straight into the water upon beginning the stunt. Among the women, Janna advanced to the second stunt despite experiencing injury after her right foot {{got caught in the}} <b>net</b> <b>traversing</b> the fourth yellow line and had to be rescued and rushed to the hospital; Savannah was able to reach the third yellow line slower than RJ did before falling and was therefore out in the running {{for the rest of the}} round. In the second stunt, Manuel and Jommy become automatic qualifiers for the third stunt; Manuel's time was 4:30 while Jommy's was 4:05. In the third stunt, Jommy drove so fast that by the time the car re-entered the truck, it jumped and piled itself over one of the reserve cars inside, injuring eight of the Argentine crew who were in the truck. Despite this, he not only won over Manuel by 24 seconds (29 seconds for Jommy, 53 seconds for Manuel), he also broke another world Fear Factor record; the previous one was 30 seconds by another contestant of Frente al Miedo. Jommy therefore won the second and the last P50,000.|$|R
