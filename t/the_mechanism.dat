We consider not only <b>the</b> pivotal <b>mechanism,</b> <b>the</b> majority voting <b>mechanism,</b> <b>the</b> random serial dictatorship <b>mechanism,</b> and <b>the</b> unanimity <b>mechanism,</b> but also <b>the</b> random chair pivotal mechanism (Faltings 2005), {{which is a}} probabilistic variant of <b>the</b> pivotal <b>mechanism.</b> We first show that the random chair pivotal <b>mechanism,</b> <b>the</b> majority voting <b>mechanism,</b> <b>the</b> random serial dictatorship <b>mechanism,</b> and <b>the</b> unanimity <b>mechanism</b> are second-best efficient. Next, we calculate the expected welfare of <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by <b>the</b> Monte Carlo method, where each agent's valuation is independently, identically, and uniformly (or normally) distributed. These calculations exhibit that the random chair pivotal mechanism is more efficient than <b>the</b> other <b>mechanisms.</b> We also show that in large economies, the random chair pivotal mechanism is efficient, while <b>the</b> other <b>mechanisms</b> might be highly inefficient. Finally, we characterize the random chair pivotal mechanism with strategy-proofness, budget-balance, equal treatment of equals, and decision-robustness...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of {{reproductive}} isolation have been classified {{in a number}} of ways. Zoologist Ernst Mayr classified <b>the</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{of reproductive}} isolation in two broad categories: pre-zygotic for those that act before fertilization (or before mating in the case of animals) and post-zygotic for those that act after it. <b>The</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are genetically controlled and can appear in species whose geographic distributions overlap (sympatric speciation) or are separate (allopatric speciation).|$|R
30|$|This {{may result}} from the {{complexity}} of <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism.</b> <b>The</b> VLS <b>mechanism</b> involves three phases and two interfaces (specifically, vapor–liquid and liquid–solid interfaces). The chemical reactions of dissolution and precipitation {{are involved in the}} working of <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism,</b> which is not the case with <b>the</b> VS <b>mechanism</b> [25]–[27]. Diffusion in the gas and liquid phases is also involved. These reactions and diffusions during <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism</b> require high activation energies. Meanwhile, the growth of nanowires via <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism</b> competes with <b>the</b> counter growth of interfacial thin layer via <b>the</b> VS <b>mechanism.</b> Generally, <b>the</b> VS <b>mechanism</b> is simple as compared to <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism,</b> which involves three phases and two interfaces [26, 27]. Thus, the activation energy for <b>the</b> VS <b>mechanism</b> is lower than that for <b>the</b> VLS <b>mechanism</b> and thus could initiate earlier. This interfacial layer interrupts the epitaxial relationship between the nanowires and the substrate, as this layer is polycrystalline and thus has a surface with various crystalline directions. This results in the random growth of GaN nanowires, as shown in Figure  1 a.|$|R
