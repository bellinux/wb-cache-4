40|$|Introduction. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>contain</b> short {{introduction}} to history of complicated signals and list of common sequences, used in spectrum spreading. Method of creating Kasami sequences. In <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is shown sequence creation method, based on method of creating maximum length sequence. Creating {{of the structural}} schema of Kasami sequences generator. Principles of construction of Kasami sequence generator are shown in <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> Example of generator for sequence with length 63 symbols, which are created using method, mentioned in previous article, is also shown. Spectrum of Kasami sequences. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>contain</b> amplitude and phase spectrum of two Kasami sequences with lengths of 1023 and 255 symbols. Theoretical formulas are created using Discrete Fourier Transform operation, and graphics are plotted using Fast Fourier Transform operation. Phase spectrum data are also been changed by unwrap operation for better visibility. Conclusion. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> <b>contain</b> analysis of characteristics of previously shown spectrum. Several conclusions are made about correlation between sequence and spectrum characteristics. These conclusions include that made about amplitude spectrum form dependence of sequence length, type and basic impulse characteristics...|$|R
