40|$|An {{investigation}} on loss assessment of <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Cutworm</b> (Spodoptera litura F.) on turnip crop was under taken during winter season, 1998 - 99 at Z. A. Bhutto Agricultural College, Dokri, Sindh, Pakistan. The seeds of local turnip variety were planted during {{second week of}} October, 1998. The insect population observations were recorded one month after sowing. The population of cutworm remained on turnip crop from November, 1998 to February, 1999, which indicated one generation of the pest on turnip crop. The maximum population of <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Cutworm</b> (Spodoptera litura F.) was 11. 72 per plant, which recorded 12. 25 percent damage in the crop at 19. 97 ï¿½C temperature and 75. 85 % relative humidity. The population of <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Cutworm</b> was significantly correlated with {{the age of the}} turnip plants. During November-December (vegetative stage) the population percentage was positively correlated and showed increasing trend (b= 0. 24). However, population was negatively correlated and had decreasing trend (b= - 0. 249) when the crop was at maturity phase. This was {{due to the fact that}} crop early growth phase had sufficient number of green leaves containing chlorophyll which favoured the pest population for the food and survival...|$|E
40|$|Flavan- 3 -ols {{contribute}} significantly to flavonoid content of tea (Camellia sinensis L.). Dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) {{are known to be}} key regulatory enzymes of flavan- 3 -ols biosynthesis. In this study, we have generated the transgenic tobacco overexpressing individually tea cDNA CsDFR and CsANR encoding for DFR and ANR to evaluate their influence on developmental and protective abilities of plant against biotic stress. The transgenic lines of CsDFR and CsANR produced early flowering and better seed yield. Both types of transgenic tobacco showed higher content of flavonoids than control. Flavan- 3 -ols such as catechin, epicatechin and epicatechingallate were found to be increased in transgenic lines. The free radical scavenging activity of CsDFR and CsANR transgenic lines was improved. Oxidative stress was observed to induce lesser cell death in transgenic lines compared to control tobacco plants. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing CsDFR and CsANR also showed resistance against infestation by a <b>tobacco</b> leaf <b>cutworm</b> Spodoptera litura. Results suggested that the overexpression of CsDFR and CsANR cDNA in tobacco has improved flavonoids content and antioxidant potential. These attributes in transgenic tobacco have ultimately improved their growth and development, and biotic stress tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Rhynocoris fuscipes is a {{potential}} predator of many economically important pests in India. In the present study, its venomous saliva (VS) was collected by milking and diluted with HPLC grade water to different concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 ppm). Microinjection of Rhynocoris fuscipes VS was more toxic than its oral administration in Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm) and Spodoptera litura (<b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm).</b> Thus, R. fuscipes VS {{was found to be}} toxic to third instar S. litura and H. armigera with respective LD 50 s of 846. 35 and 861. 60 ppm/larva at 96 hours after microinjection. The current results showed that VS of Rhynocoris fuscipes caused mortality of H. armigera and S. litura. Active peptides from VS may be isolated, identified and assessed for their impact in order to ascertain how they alter the physiology of these pests, information that could be applicable in pest management programs...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{essential}} plant oils, {{widely used}} as fragrances and #avors in the perfume and food industries, {{have long been}} reputed to repel insects. Recent investigations in several countries con"rm that some plant essential oils not only repel insects, but have contact and fumigant insecticidal actions against speci"c pests, and fungicidal actions against some important plant pathogens. As part of an e!ort aimed at the development of reduced-risk pesticides based on plant essential oils, toxic and sublethal e!ects of some essential oil terpenes and phenols have been investigated using the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm</b> (Spodoptera litura) and the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) as model pest species.

40|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura, {{is among}} the most {{widespread}} and destructive agricultural pests, feeding on over 100 crops throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. By genome sequencing, physical mapping and transcriptome analysis, we found that the gene families encoding receptors for bitter or toxic substances and detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P 450, carboxylesterase and glutathione-S-transferase, were massively expanded in this polyphagous species, enabling its extraordinary ability to detect and detoxify many plant secondary compounds. Larval exposure to insecticidal toxins induced expression of detoxification genes, and knockdown of representative genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced larval survival, consistent with their contribution to the insectâs natural pesticide tolerance. A population genetics study indicated that this species expanded throughout southeast Asia by migrating along a South IndiaâSouth ChinaâJapan axis, adapting to wide-ranging ecological conditions with diverse host plants and insecticides, surviving and adapting with the aid of its expanded detoxification systems. The findings of this study will enable the development of new pest management strategies for the control of major agricultural pests such as S. litura...|$|E

Injection of dsCYP 9 A 40 (silencing of CYP 9 A 40 by RNA interference) significantly increased the susceptibility of S. litura larvae to the tested plant allelochemicals and insecticides. These results indicate that CYP 9 A 40 expression in S. litura is related to consumption of xenobiotics and suggest that CYP 9 A 40 is involved in detoxification of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Larvae of the {{polyphagous}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm</b> moth, Spodoptera litura (S. litura), encounter potentially toxic allelochemicals in food. It {{is therefore}} important for S. litura to produce detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s). In this study, {{we have identified}} two novel cytochrome P 450 genes of S. litura, named CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that they belong to the CYP 321 A subfamily. Expression levels of these genes at different development stages were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The highest expression {{was found in the}} midgut and the fat body. Larvae fed with a diet supplemented with xanthotoxin or coumarin showed a strongly increased expression of CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9 in the midgut and fat body as compared to larvae that consumed a control diet. In contrast, larvae consuming a diet containing aflatoxin B 1 or quercetin did not induce the expression of these genes. CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9 showed different expression profiles with respect to certain allelochemicals. For example, a diet containing cinnamic acid stimulated the expression of CYP 321 A 9, whereas no changes were observed for CYP 321 A 7. We suggest that the fine tuning of P 450 gene expression is an important adaptation mechanism that allows polyphagous S. litura larvae to survive in a changing chemical environment...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that the toxic domain of a wild-type Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crylC gene could be expressed efficiently in the chloroplasts of transplastomic tobacco plants, resulting in high resistance to tobacco insects. A DNA fragment with the toxic domain of a wild-type Bt crylC gene was constructed {{under the control of}} rbcL promoter and an E. coli thra terminator in a plasmid vector flanked by chloroplast sequences. This plasmid vector was then delivered into the chloroplast through biolistic bombardment technique. Plant transformants that possessed spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance were selected, and the integration of crylC gene in these transformants was confirmed by PCR and Southern analyses. Results from PCR and Southern hybridization indicated that the truncated crylC gene was integrated into the chloroplast genome as we expected through homologous recombination. High expression level of the integrated Bt crylC gene in the chloroplasts was observed through Northern and Western hybridization assays. These transplastomic tobacco plants are highly toxic to the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm</b> Spodoptera litura, causing a mortality rate of 76. 9 % to 100 % after 72 h of feeding. The truncated Bt toxin is expressed in high levels in the chloroplast (about 1 % of total proteins) and the plastid transgenes were known not to transmit through pollen. So that, this study will facilitate not only improvement in breeding for insect-resistant plants, but also the prevention of contamination of transgenes among crop plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} management of insect pests and vectors still represents {{a major challenge}} in current entomology. Culex quinquefasciatus Say is a key vector of lymphatic filariasis, Rift Valley fever, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis virus. Recently, {{the importance of the}} eco-friendly control of C. quinquefasciatus larval population using plant-borne biopesticides, including essential oils (EOs), has been stressed. Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) also known as <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm,</b> {{is one of the most}} destructive moth agricultural pests in tropic and sub-tropic regions. Despite the fact that sea fennel (Crithmum maritimum L., Apiaceae) is considered as a promising biosaline crop, its potential for commercial cultivation has not yet been exploited. Notably, it has been reported that in coastal marine environments insects stay away from sea fennel. This aromatic plant is endowed with secretory structures as ducts and vittae storing volatile compounds. In this study, the chemical composition of sea fennel essential oils from three different EO accessions, namely France (Brittany), Central and South Italy (Marche and Sicily regions) have been analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and their toxicity against larvae of C. quinquefasciatus and S. littoralis evaluated. Selected pure compounds from the essential oils mentioned above have also been tested. The essential oils showed notable variability in chemical composition, being dominated by dillapiole and -terpinene (French EO), limonene and -terpinene (central Italy EO) and thymol methyl ether and-terpinene (Sicilian EO). As found out, the significantly most efficient essential oils were obtained from the seeds and aerial parts of plants of the French region. For these EOs, LD 50 values were estimated as 62. 3 and 71. 7 Î¼g/larva for S. littoralis, respectively, and LC 50 as 13. 7 and 15. 6 Î¼l/L for C. quinquefasciatus larvae, respectively. gamma-Terpinene and myristicin were the most effective on C. quinquefasciatus larvae showing LC 50 values < 17 Î¼l/L. Overall, these findings shed light on the insecticidal potential of C. maritimum EO against mosquitoes and agricultural pests, allowing to identify the most effective chemotype, and to stimulate cultivation of this species as a source of botanical insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Spodoptera litura (F.), {{is one of}} {{the major}} pests of peanut plant (Arachis hypogaea) in Taiwan. With the {{increasing}} concern of food safety and environmental protection, scientists pay attention to the integrated pest management (IPM) as well as the related economic injury level (EIL) and economic threshold (ET) in peanut production. To calculate EIL, a quantitative assessment of the injury of S. litura on peanuts is necessary. In this study, artificial defoliation was used to assess the relationship between injury and yield at different plant growth stages. Moreover, the age-stage, two-sex life table and consumption rate of S. litura were collected under different conditions (25 oC constant condition, outdoors in spring 23. 6 oC, and in fall 28. 3 oC). Results showed that there were significant differences in developmental times, survival rate, fecundity, and hatch rate under different conditions. At 25 oC, the intrinsic rate of increase (0. 1838 d- 1), finite rate of increase (1. 2017 d- 1), and net reproductive rate (963. 2 offspring) were the highest among all treatments. The mean generation time was the shortest in fall (34. 5 d). Incorporating the results of artificial defoliation and consumption rate, the yield loss under different conditions ranged from 0. 21 to 2. 18 g/ 6 th instar/plant. For the pesticide 14. 5 % indoxacarb (with 64. 9 % control efficiency), the highest EILs were in fall and they were 0. 78, 2. 00, 1. 80, and 4. 55 6 th instar/plant at vegetative stage, blooming/pegging stage, pod-set stage, and pod-fill stage, respectively. To derive ET from EIL, the data of stage survival rate and average hatch rate were integrated. The highest values of ETs in fall were 3. 55, 9. 13, 8. 20, and 20. 76 eggs/plant at vegetative stage, bloom/pegging stage, pod-set stage, and pod-fill stage, respectively. The higher EILs and ETs in fall might be due to lower consumption rate, survival rate and hatch rate of S. litura, while the higher EILs and ETs at pod-fill stage might be due to the higher tolerance to pest injury. To transform the number of male adults collected by pheromone traps to ETs as eggs per plant, computer simulation was used to project population growth and to estimate the relationship between the number of moths caught by pheromone traps and egg production. Because there are more factors included in the population growth of S. litura and the damage it caused, more researches in its ecology and fields experiment are needed to build an applicable pest management system. å¨å°ç£ï¼æç´å¤è¾(Spodoptera litura (F.)) æ¯è±çæ¤æ ªçéè¦å®³è²ä¹ä¸ï¼çºæ¸å°è¾²è¥ä½¿ç¨ãä¿è­·ç°å¢ãæé«è¾²ç¢åå®å¨åè³ªï¼ç¶åå®³è²ç®¡ç(IPM) çºç®åå®å¨è¾²æ¥­ãåçç¨è¥æ¨¡å¼ç¼å±ä¹ä¸»è»¸ï¼èå»ºç«ç¶æ¿çºå®³æ°´æº(economic injury level, EIL) èç¶æ¿éç(economic threshold, ET) å³çºéå°æ­¤ç®çä¹éè¦æ¢ä»¶ãå¨EILæ¹é¢ï¼çºæ±ºå®æç´å¤è¾å±å®³èè±çç¢éä¹éçéä¿ï¼æ¬ç ç©¶å©ç¨äººå·¥å»èæ¨¡æ¬å®³è²æ¼ä¸åç°å¢ä¸(25 oCãæ¥å­£åæº« 23. 6 oCãç§å­£åæº« 28. 3 oC) å°è±çåçé·æä¹çºå®³èå°è±çç¢éå½±é¿ï¼å¯¦é©çµæé¡¯ç¤ºæ¯é»å­é½¡å¹¼è²å¯é ææ¯å¢è½è±ç 0. 21 - 2. 18 åçç¢éæå¤±ãæ­¤å¤ï¼æ¬è«æç ç©¶æç´å¤è¾å¨æ¥ãç§å©å­£ä»¥åå®¤å§ 25 oCææº«ç°å¢ä¸ä¹å©æ§çå½è¡¨èåé£éï¼çµæé¡¯ç¤ºä¸åç°å¢ä¸åç¼è²æéãå­æ´»çãç¹æ®çèåµå­µåççæå·®ç°ï¼å¨å®¤å§ 25 oCææº«ç°å¢ä¸ï¼å¶å§å¨å¢æ®ç(0. 1838 d- 1) ãçµæ¥µå¢æ®ç(1. 2017 d- 1) èæ·¨å¢æ®ç(963. 2 offspring) æé«ï¼å¹³åä¸ä»£æéåä»¥ç§å­£æç­çº 34. 5 å¤©ãçµåçå½è¡¨ãåé£éèäººå·¥å»èä¹çµæï¼å¨é¸æä»¥ 14. 5 %å å¾åä¹è¥åé²æ²»æï¼é²æ²»ççº 64. 9 %ï¼ï¼è±çä¸åçé·æä¹EILä»¥ç§å­£ç°å¢ä¸æé«ï¼çé¤çé·æãéè±æãçµè¢æèåå¯¦æåå¥çº 0. 78 ã 2. 00 ã 1. 80 å 4. 55 ä¹å­é½¡å¹¼è²/æ ªãæå¾ï¼æ¬ç ç©¶ç±EILèçå½è¡¨ä¸­é½¡æå­æ´»çèå¹³åå­µåçï¼ä¼°ç® ETãçµæé¡¯ç¤ºï¼ç§å­£ç°å¢ä¸ä¹ETå¼æé«ï¼çé¤çé·æãéè±æãçµè¢æèåå¯¦æåå¥çº 3. 55 ã 9. 13 ã 8. 20 å 20. 76 ç²åµ/æ ªãç¶åèè¨ï¼å¨ç§å­£ç°å¢ä¸ï¼ç±æ¼æç´å¤è¾åé£éå°ãå­æ´»çèåµå­µåçé½è¼ä½ï¼å æ­¤å¶è½å®¹å¿ä¹å®³è²æ¸è¼é«ãè±çåå¯¦æä¹EILèETè¼é«åé¡¯ç¤ºæ­¤ææå°æ¼å®³è²å±å®³æè¼é«èåæ§ãæå¾ï¼çºéåç®åç°éç£æ¸¬ä¹æè¡ï¼æ¬æå©ç¨é»è¦ç¨å¼æ¨¡æ¬æç´å¤è¾æç¾¤çé·ï¼çµåç£æ¸¬èªéä¹æè²æ¸èå¯è½ç¢ä¸ä¹åµç²æ¸ï¼æ¨æ¸¬ç£æ¸¬ä¹æè²æ¸æ¯å¦éå°ETå¼ãç±æ¼EILèETé¨æè®åï¼æéèéä¹å å­éå¸¸å¤ï¼çºä½¿æ­¤ç³»çµ±æ´è¶¨å®åï¼å°æè«¸å¤çæèé²æ²»ç¸éç ç©¶éæçºé²è¡ãAbstract [...] i æè¦ [...] iii Introduction [...] 1 Literature Review [...] . 3 Materials and Methods [...] . 14 Results [...] . 22 Discussion [...] 35 Conclusion [...] 44 References Cited [...] 46 Figures and Tables [...] 58 Appendix [...] 8...|$|E
40|$|The present {{writers have}} tried several {{experiments}} {{to determine whether}} the bean basic semisynthetic media and the improved rearing method for rearing the <b>tobacco</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Prodenia litura FABRICIUS, in the previous experiments can be adapted for the present artificial cultures of both the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon HUFNAGEL, and the turnip moth, A. fucosa BUTLER. 1. Both normal abult males and females which could lay viable eggs could be reared successfully from the second instar larvae of black cutworms on four kinds of media the kidney bean media, soy bean media, kidney-soy bean media and soy-azuki bean media, though the duration of larval growing period became longer and the percentages of pupation, emergence and the yield of adults obtained from the larvae initially used were lower than those from the control which was fed on the leaves of sweet potato. The kidney bean media seemed to be more suitable for the artificial rearing of this insect as compared with three other bean basic media. At 26 â., the durations of larval, prepupal and pupal period were 18. 5, 2. 2 and 11. 0 days, respectively. The percentages of pupation, emergence and yield of emerged adults from the initial second instar larvae were 66. 0, 30. 3 and 20. 0 %, respectively. The pupal weights were 291. 0 mg., for males and 303. 0 mg. for female. The number of eggs laid per female was 234 and the hatchadility of these eggs, 50. 2 %. 2. Using the kidney bean media, which seemed to be the most promising medium, three successive generations of the black cutworms were reared successfully as shown in Table 2. However, the results were slightly inferior to those in the previous experiments of Prodenia lilura FABRICIUS. 3. In the experiments in which the larvae were reared individually using one larva per glass tube, the numbers of moulting and larval instars passed, duration of each instar period, width of head capsule of each instar were observed more exactly than {{in the case of the}} above culture. The percentages of pupation, emergence and yield of adults were also examined accurately in this experiment. These results were considerably superior to those obtained in the above ones cxcept that the duration of larval period was longer. 4. Three successive generations of turnip moths have been reared using the same procedure and kidney bean media as used in the successive rearing of the black cutworms. Although full data on the third generation could not obtained by this time, it was expected that these successive generations could be reared successfully as in the rearing of thc black cutworms. The life history data of the turnip moth reared on the kidney bean media at 26 â. were as follow. The durations of larval, prepupal and pupal period were 28. 6, 2. 9 and 15. 6 days, respectively. The percentages of pupation, emergence and yield of adults were 77. 8, 83. 3 and 64. 8 %, respectively. The pupal weights were 438. 8 mg. for males and 488. 8 mg. for females.
