40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan is an {{organization}} that invests in nonprofit and government organizations which conduct projects intended {{to clean up the}} environment. The main goal of <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan is {{to improve the quality of}} Lake Michigan and the life of its communities. This paper conducts an analysis of the total economic impact of all <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan-funded projects between 2011 and 2013. The methodology used is IMPLAN, an input-output method of analysis that estimates to what extent different spending categories affect the local economy in terms of direct, indirect, and induced spending. Both primary impacts (those impacts that are directly caused by <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan) and secondary impacts (those impacts that are indirectly caused by <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan) were considered. The primary finding of this study is that <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan has had a very positive, demonstrable economic impact in the southeastern region of Wisconsin including, but not limited to, creation of over 480 full-time equivalent jobs and increasing property values by over $ 45. 5 million.

However, at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher, U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator Francis E. Warren, Congress appropriated <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> the construction of a chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913. On September 19, 1914, Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King, 1st U.S. Cavalry, were the first couple to be married in the new chapel.

5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> the Contras, or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} {{about the condition}} of the castle and discussions took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E

At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). <b>The</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary.

The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the Seeley G. Mudd Fund granted Vassar $1.3 {{million for}} the {{construction}} of a new chemistry building. Mudd was a California-based cardiologist, professor, and trustee with the University of Southern California's School of Medicine as well as with a number of other West Coast schools. Over his lifetime, Mudd donated more than $10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968, his will established a further $44 million for building construction at universities and colleges, with the stipulation that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving the funding. While the cost of the building was originally reported to be $4.5 million, this estimate grew to $6.5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to $7.2 million once the project was completed. The College planned to cover the costs not paid for by the Mudd Fund with a $100 million development fundraising program that spanned the entirety of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} {{the activities and}} scope of his office, building a parallel state. This soon started a conflict with Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E

5|$|When Friedrich Wilhelm IV {{came to the}} Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions {{to develop}} Berlin as a {{cultural}} centre (including {{the establishment of a}} music school, and reform of music for the church), the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. He was reluctant to undertake the task, especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music, and, at the King's request, music for productions of Sophocles's Antigone (1841) and Oedipus at Colonus (1845), Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1843) and Racine's Athalie (1845). But <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> the school never materialised, and various of the court's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|Due to Song's {{enormous}} {{population growth}} and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly gentry class would now take over grassroots affairs on the vast local level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, local tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and local elites supervised local affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of local communities; any local magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon {{the cooperation of the}} few or many local gentry in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> schools was drawn from private financing. This limited role of government officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and local affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of local gentry to perform necessary duties in their communities.|$|E

As a result of Theresa's fate, Oxford fired Daniel and quietly removed all references to him ever having been at the university.

While in Essex, Massachusetts, Daniel saw a news report covering {{the discovery of the}} apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 {{in the depths of the}} Sunda Trench. Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax, urged him to go to the island, which he said would heal him of his plight. At first, Daniel was reluctant, but Eloise convinced him to go. Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), which is organized by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) and led by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Their mission was to travel to the island, find Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the then current leader of the Others, and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest, which contained poisonous gases.|$|E
