5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women. Historical Chinese culture has not recognized {{a concept of}} sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E
5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E

5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E

40|$|In {{areas of}} Africa hard hit by HIV/AIDS, there are growing {{concerns}} {{that many women}} lose access to land {{after the death of}} <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> However, there remains a dearth of quantitative evidence on the proportion of widows who lose access <b>to</b> <b>their</b> deceased <b>husband’s</b> land, whether they lose all or part of that land, and whether there are factors specific to the widow, her family, or the broader community that influence her ability to maintain rights to land. This study examines these issues using average treatment effects models with propensity score matching applied to a nationally representative panel data of 5, 342 rural households surveyed in 2001 and 2004. Results are highly variable, with roughly a third of households incurring the death of a male household head controlling less than 50 % of the land they had prior <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband’s</b> death, while over a quarter actually controlled as much or even more land than while <b>their</b> <b>husbands</b> were alive. Widows who were in relatively wealthy households prior <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husband’s</b> death lose proportionately more land than widows in households that were relatively poor. Older widows and widows related to the local headman enjoy greater land security. Women in matrilineal inheritance areas were no less likely to lose land than women in patrilineal areas. ...|$|R

25|$|The Age of Reason did {{not bring}} much more for women: men, {{including}} Enlightenment aficionados, believed that women were naturally destined to be principally wives and mothers.

25|$|The FLDS Church {{teaches the}} {{doctrine}} of plural marriage, which states that a man having multiple wives is ordained of and a commandment by God; the doctrine requires it {{in order for a}} man to receive the highest form of salvation.

25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands,</b> please them, and not make them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types of wives within marriage.|$|E

Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>husbands.</b> In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E
