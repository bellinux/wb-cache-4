40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the ‘Artist-in-Residence’ has a long-standing precedent {{in many areas of}} social and business activity where the imperative to present a different perspective on a number of aspects of everyday activity and to bring art into otherwise aesthetically impoverished environments has been seen to be of great benefit. Consequently, their appearance in corporations and state institutions is well known. Their place in an art education setting is perhaps less frequent, but by no means unusual, as the educational value of regular exposure to a ‘qualified’ or ‘experienced’ practitioner carrying out their own work has long been recognised. However, the use of a ‘Designer-in-Residence’ in a design for production education setting (as opposed to a designer-maker or craft environment) is perhaps even less well documented. The School of Design Technology at the University of Huddersfield recently decided to allocate an amount of research funding to provide an ‘Artist-in-Residence’ to work alongside Fine Art students, and a ‘Designer-in-Residence’ to work alongside Product and Transport design students for a period of one year. The detailed description {{of the role of the}} Designer-in-Residence in educational terms; the benefits to students in improving project management and time planning; and seeing the pace of professional design work in real time are substantial, but perhaps the subject of a slightly different paper to <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> <b>Here,</b> we wish instead to concentrate not so much on the process of using a Designer-in-Residence, but on the content of the particular project being undertaken, the far-reaching implications the work has for the practice of design and design education both on a theoretical and philosophical as well as a more pragmatic level. The title of the project ‘Future Factories’ describes the exploration of the potential for the direct digital manufacturing, using the latest CAD 3 D modelling and rapid prototyping techniques, in which a random element of variance is introduced by the computer software. The outputs from this practice-based research project are expected to consist of a number of inspirational products produced as a result of the residency itself, which will be exhibited in a traditional gallery environment and later digitally – either on-line or by CD-ROM dissemination. Alongside the practice-based research outputs, it is hoped there will be a publication describing the parallel Designer-in-Residence and Artist-in-Residence projects at Huddersfield in a pedagogic context, as well as a number of different academic papers (of which this is one) addressing the different theoretical and contextual issues raised by the content of the ‘Future Factories’ project...|$|E
40|$|Gliricidia sepium {{for field}} and garden Cue: Gliricidia sepium is {{a tree with}} many uses. Originating in the {{lowlands}} of Central America, the tree is now planted widely across the tropics, and is commonly used as a living fence species. Its nitrogen-rich leaves {{can be used as}} a mulch or green manure; adding the leaves to the soil improves crop production by boosting soil nutrients, controlling weeds, conserving moisture and reducing soil temperatures. Its leaves can also be used as fodder, especially for ruminants, and its branches make good firewood and building materials. In eastern Zambia, the World Agroforestry Centre has been working closely with farmers to develop better ways of using this versatile tree. Chris Kakunta spoke to one of these farmers, Harrison Chongwe from Chipata North, about how cultivating Gliricidia sepium, and using the leaves as a green manure, has affected his productivity, both in his maize fields and in his vegetable garden. IN:		?This tree is a tree that will continue. ? OUT:		?. have palatable vegetables on their plate. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta was talking to Harrison Chongwe, known as the Professor because of his agroforestry innovations. Transcript Chongwe	This tree is a tree that will continue to supply fertility into your garden because once you plant it, you plant it at least for a long time. You can cut the stump, it will re-shoot, regenerating each time supplying leaves every season. Kakunta 	We are right up in your garden. Could you just show me some of the vegetables that you have grown and perhaps also show me exactly what type of leaves you have put in the soil. Let?s go and show me. Chongwe 	Yes sure. Kakunta	I can see that you have some onion here and some cabbages. What did you do to these crops, they look so beautiful? Chongwe	Oh yes, in this area here, this is the red creola onion and I?ve applied Gliricidia sepium leaves, we call it biomass technology. We have got a first bed of onions, a second bed of sugarloaf cabbage, in fact six of them I have been applying, have incorporated them with Gliricidia sepium. Kakunta 	With the leaves? Chongwe	With the leaves. Kakunta 	So the leaves are actually helping you fertilise your crop in the main field as well as in the garden? Chongwe	Yes it does. So researchers have come up to say a farmer could be helped for two seasons possibly. During the rainy season we can apply biomass in the main field, but off-season it could be useful in somewhere. So they have come up with a good answer to say, can?t we try it on a dimba, in the garden? Kakunta 	And it?s working also well? Chongwe	And it is working so well. Kakunta 	So are you benefiting from this technology Mr Chongwe? Chongwe	Yes very much so because it has saved me with the fertiliser headache. Kakunta 	So in terms of the yield, how different is this yield compared to when you were applying fertilisers? Chongwe	Previously if fertiliser could come in good time it could put up a good yield. But of late, during the past ten years there has been an erratic supply of fertilisers. So you cannot say I had a good harvest time previously but this time my harvest is steadily increasing. Kakunta 	Obviously one would say why did it take so long for you to actually embark on this project? You didn?t know about it? Chongwe	No, the thing is when you are given trials by the researchers each project has got its own advantages or disadvantages. But in <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>here</b> the only disadvantage is the labour that is involved, there is intensive labour. It takes time to learn, that is what I can say. But now this technology is settling with me, I can do anything, I?ve got my own innovations as you can see. Kakunta 	In fact I?m told they call you Professor in this area? Why do they call you Professor? Chongwe	That name came as a professor because the retired general at the head office paid me a visit. And seeing my work that we have done as partners, researchers and the farmers, they were impressed. Kakunta 	Wonderful. Now as we come to the end of the interview Mr Chongwe, what would you like to tell your fellow farmers who are yet to practise this concept? Chongwe	My word is to encourage them to participate in this technology. This technology is very much free. Anybody can take it. If they have got a dimba they should also try it on the dimba and they will have palatable vegetables on their plate. End of track. Chris Kakunta visits Harrison Chongwe, an innovative farmer who is using Gliricidia sepium instead of chemical fertilizer, with excellent results...|$|E
