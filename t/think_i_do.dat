500|$|William Godwin's {{theories}} of biographical writing significantly influenced Shelley's style. Her father believed that biography {{could tell the}} history of a culture as well as serve a pedagogical function. Shelley felt that her nonfiction works were better than her fiction, writing in 1843 to publisher Edward Moxon: [...] "I should prefer quieter work, to be gathered from other works—such as my lives for the Cyclopedia—& which I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> much better than romancing." ...|$|E
500|$|Balzac had {{difficulty}} {{adapting to the}} rote style of learning at the school. As a result, he was frequently sent to the [...] "alcove", a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students. (The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered Honoré, replied: [...] "Remember M. Balzac? I should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon {{more than a hundred}} times!") Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> better than anybody".|$|E

500|$|Craig {{was again}} {{the centre of}} media speculation, with some media likening his arrival to Bradman's first tour of England in 1930. Bradman had scored a world Test series record of 974runs in 1930, a mark that remains unsurpassed. At a {{reception}} {{at the start of}} the tour, British judge and cricket enthusiast Lord Birkett said [...] "If I know the English as I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> every Mother in the land will pray for him." [...] During the tour he was presented with a birthday cake on television. However, the trip was unsuccessful in terms of batting.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
2500|$|Wales is a self-avowed Objectivist, {{referring}} to the philosophy invented by writer Ayn Rand in the mid-20th century that emphasizes reason, individualism, and capitalism. Wales first encountered the philosophy through reading Rand's novel The Fountainhead during his undergraduate period and, in 1992, founded an electronic mailing list devoted to [...] "Moderated Discussion of Objectivist Philosophy". Though he has stated that the philosophy [...] "colours everything I do and think", he has said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a better job—than {{a lot of people}} who self-identify as Objectivists—of not pushing my point of view on other people." ...|$|E

60|$|P.P.S.--I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> saw Roche {{sleeping}} {{with his head}} on the lady's shoulder, in the coach. I couldn't swear it, and the light was deceptive. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Reuniting {{at their}} parents' {{suburban}} D.C. home, Marvin's brother Frankie discussed {{the events of}} his tenure at Vietnam, detailing experiences that sometimes left the two brothers consoling each other in tears. Then after Frankie explained witnessing violence and murder before he was to depart back to the states, he recalled Marvin sitting propped up in a bed {{with his hands in}} his face. Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, but now I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I just have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet. But I can do it with music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought I was over exaggerating the gay character. But I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> In fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, I {{know for a fact that}} an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit. If I don't the audience are disappointed".|$|E
2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... {{what seems to be}} the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?" [...] Kurtz said, [...] "Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of [...] category." ...|$|E
