5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Boyce {{embarked}} on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond {{were part of the}} expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. After hiring local porters and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured, <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.|$|E

25|$|The sunni {{scholar and}} sufi mystic Ibn Arabi stated the angels {{are the first}} beings created and {{distinguished}} between angels of the corporeal and the incorporeal world, called Al-Ama (the cloud), there all of the creation will be created. In this place, angelic beings dwelled {{in the presence of}} God, but are unable to recognize each other or even themselves, until God elected one of them, to become the Higher Pen writing, everything God will create in the cosmos. The angels in the corporeal world are more akin to the humans than in the majority Islamic view. Accordingly, angels are spirits blown into light, while humans are spirits blown into shape, and jinn spirits blown into wind (wind is referring to <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air,</b> discharged from the flame called marijin min nar, from which the jinn are created according to the Quran). Humans are even superior to the angels, because angels can just follow straight lines, therefore they can function as forces of nature and perform specific tasks but are unable to know Gods names, attributes or to perceive God in different ways like humans can do. Angels hesitated to bow before Adam, because they were unable to see the true nature of human. Some angels erred in believing their way of perceiving God is the only way, and they become guilty of opposing Adam as a vice regent and fixing on one interpretation of God to the exclusion of others.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E
500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air,</b> results in a low-pressure area called a thermal low. [...] Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean. [...] This generates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall {{is caused by the}} moist ocean-air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation. [...] In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. [...] Monsoons resemble sea and land breezes, terms usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale - also stronger and seasonal.|$|E

[...] Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, which creates an associated heat low over the terrain and enhances any thermal lows which would have otherwise existed.

[...] Thermal lows which develop near sea level can build in height during the warm season, or summer, to the elevation of the 700 hPa pressure surface, which lies near [...] above sea level. [...] Heat lows normally are stationary and have a weak cyclonic circulation. [...] As they are strongest at the surface and warm near their center, and weaker aloft where the air is more stable, the thermal low is considered warm core. [...] The strongest versions of these features globally are over Arabia, the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent, Arizona, Mexican plateau, northwest Argentina, southwestern Spain, Australia, and northern Africa. [...] The formation of the heat low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} climatology, high {{pressure}} forms at the horse latitudes, or torrid zone, between the latitudes of 20 and 40 {{degrees from the}} equator, {{as a result of}} air that has been uplifted at the equator. [...] As <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> rises it cools, losing moisture; it is then transported poleward where it descends, creating the high-pressure area. [...] This is part of the Hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high, and is strongest in the summer. [...] The subtropical ridge is a warm core high-pressure system, meaning it strengthens with height. [...] Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systems.|$|E
500|$|Over land, intense, rapid {{solar heating}} {{of the land}} surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the {{atmosphere}} via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum.

[...] Thermal lows tend to have weak circulations, and can extend to [...] in height. [...] Thermal lows over the western and southern portions of North America, northern Africa, and southeast Asia are strong enough to lead to summer monsoon conditions. [...] Development of thermal lows inland of the coastline lead to the development of sea breezes. [...] Sea breezes combined with rugged topography near the coast can encourage poor air quality.|$|E
