40|$|Abstract-Encouraging {{cooperation}} in self-organizing ad hoc networks {{has been an}} important task in the last few years.

Instead, <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communication entities as well as the route including <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate nodes are revealed.

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the filaments {{preserved in}} the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, {{who had not yet}} examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the structures.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. <b>The</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> Ahmose I unknown.|$|E
