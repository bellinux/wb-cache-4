40|$|International audienceThe {{comparative}} lack {{of interest}} in oral academic corpora and in comparisons between spoken and written academic discourse is surprising in that research on academic registers has found that mode differences are extremely important in accounting for linguistic variation (e. g. Biber, 2006; Swales, 2004). Spoken <b>academic</b> <b>genres,</b> such as conference presentations, display a very different range of lexico-grammatical features from written <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2001). It was therefore with the aim of redressing this balance that the EIIDA project was created. The main rationale behind the EIIDA project 4 was to create a corpus enabling the comparison of academic discourse from a triply contrastive perspective: discipline, language and mode...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{both the}} communicative purposes and formal linguistic features of academic weblogs. An initial analysis of 496 weblogs in use within tertiary level institutions {{was reduced to}} an in-depth analysis of 39 academic weblogs (a corpus of 16 million words). The objective was {{to see how much}} variation there might be between traditional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and <b>academic</b> weblogs. The initial hypothesis is that academic weblogs are far less formal and would favour greater use of lexico-grammatical realisations belonging to the interpersonal function of language. In order to quantify this possible variation between traditional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and <b>academic</b> weblogs, some well-known linguistic features which have been considered to be typical of academic discourse such as the agentless passive and nominalisations were investigated...|$|R

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} success of {{students}} in graduate courses depends on their skill to understand and produce the genres required by the academic setting, this work aims to investigate to what extent these courses contribute to the literacy of students in <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> It still discusses the relationship between students' expectations and the effectively acquired ability to produce and understand genres such as summaries, reviews, research projects and monographs. To answer the questions that guided this research, two procedures were adopted: first, questionnaires were administered to students from a specialization course on teaching of Portuguese language. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 10 monographs for completion of the course, with their respective drafts, to reflect the construction process. The results indicate that, despite contact with various <b>academic</b> <b>genres,</b> students encounter significant difficulties, especially in writing, the most critical example being the production of the monograph for course completion...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation, as the {{expression}} of a writer’s attitudes, opinions and values, has become a key term in discourse studies in recent years and {{has proved to be a}} particularly fruitful way of analysing academic texts. But while studies have shown the importance of evaluation in research genres, its role in seemingly more promotional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> has been largely neglected. This article examines the journal description (JD), a brief but ubiquitous feature of all journals, whether online or in print. Situated at the academic—commercial interface, the JD provides information for prospective readers and authors while endorsing a particular view of the field and positioning the journal in the academic community. Drawing on a corpus of 200 JDs in four contrasting disciplines, we show how evaluation is a key feature of this genre, influencing both lexical choices and rhetorical structure. The analysis contributes both to our understanding of a neglected <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> and the evaluative resources of language...|$|R
40|$|Hyland’s {{definition}} of genres as ‘abstract, socially recognised ways of using language’ is general {{enough to be}} widely acceptable, but as such it masks significant differences in how genres are more specifically defined and operationalised in research and teaching contexts.

40|$|First year {{students}} often experience a culture shock as certain literacy practices {{at the university}} level are different from their experiences in high schools. Some major challenges that students encounter include students’ ability to maintain academic integrity practices in their studies, to comprehend complex academic texts to outline key ideas, and to communicate confidently and effectively in diverse <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> As these challenges are common, often universities offer activities to assist students’ with their academic enculturation process. The three popular literacy teaching models currently in practice are the generic, embedded and literacies models. All the three models offer challenges in their effective practice. By evaluating the ethnographic data from the models used at UNSW Canberra Academic Language Learning Unit (ALL), this paper argues that in line with Lea and Street’s (2006) discussion, literacies is the most effective approach for developing students’ lifelong skills for effective communication, reading and critical thinking. Literary teaching should involve an advanced inquiry into writing practices in diverse disciplines helping students’ identifying and practicing using language devices and rhetorical structures in <b>academic</b> <b>genres...</b>|$|R
40|$|The book brings {{together}} a rich variety of perspectives on abstracts as an <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> Drawing on genre analysis and corpus linguistics, the studies collected here combine attention to generic structure {{with emphasis on}} language variation and change, thus offering a multi-perspective view on a genre that is {{becoming one of the}} most important in present-day research communication. The chapters are organized into three sections, each one offering distinct but sometimes combined perspectives on the exploration of this <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> The first section looks at variation across cultures through studies comparing English with Spanish, Italian and German, while also including considerations on variation across genders or the native/non-native divide. The second section centres on variation across disciplines and includes a wide range of studies exploring disciplinary identities and communities, as well as different degrees of centrality in the disciplinary community. The third and final section explores language and genre change by looking at how authorial voice and metadiscourse have changed over the past few decades under the influence of different media and different stakeholders...|$|R
30|$|Viewing from a genre perspective, the SoP is {{a highly}} complex <b>academic</b> <b>genre.</b> Unlike other student genres with {{relatively}} rigid structures, few graduate programs offer detailed requirements for SoP writing, which, combined with the varying expectations held by different graduate programs’ gatekeepers, creates enormous challenges for novice SoP writers (Chiu, 2015, 2016; Ding, 2007; Samraj & Monk, 2008). These challenges have been further intensified {{by the lack of}} institutional support for SoP writing (Brown, 2004; Dubb, 2011).|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the use of}} English within the <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> in respectively undergraduate and master level projects from Roskilde University (RUC). It has been in our interest to seek out and analyze the general trends {{that make up the}} divergences using a corpora based, quantitative approach on which we will later base a qualitative analysis. We started out identifying a wide range of discourses that make up the genre in question, but after analyzing the first batch of projects quickly concluded that a more realistic approach would be to limit ourselves to the most prominent discourses, more specifically meta-discourses described in “A Taxonomy of Metadiscourse in Spoken and Written Academic English” by Ädel (2010) and hedging as described in “Hedging in Academic Writing and EAP Textbooks” by Hyland (1994). From the results of our analysis {{we have been able to}} both ascertain similarities but also tendencies that separate the <b>two</b> <b>academic</b> levels. While a tool such as hedging surprisingly appeared to serve the same role, and in an equal fashion, on both levels, texts from the master projects distinguished themselves by generally having a more mindful and deliberate approach to meta-discourse usage, with greater confidence in their general discourse than the undergraduate projects. Master projects also proved a different usage of phorics management, which contributed to a higher quality of readability...|$|R
30|$|Research {{articles}} (RAs) are {{acknowledged as}} the most important form of scientific discourse because they are leading means of distributing academic knowledge for future use. Over the recent decades, the study of RAs has received much attention in the <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> analysis. A variety of perspectives has been put under deep consideration, including organization, lexicon, cohesion and coherence markers, rhetorical moves, etc. (e.g., Hyland & Tse, 2005; Khany & Tazik, 2010; Li & Ge, 2009; Luo & Hyland, 2016; Swales, 2004).|$|R

40|$|AbstractAcademic {{book reviews}} {{published}} in academic journals {{are expected to}} provide readers with {{both positive and negative}} evaluation of the book under review. This <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> has recently been the focus of increasing number of studies due to its evaluative and interactional nature. The present cross-cultural study aimed to explore how interpersonal metadiscourse was used in Turkish and English book reviews. The corpus used in this study consisted of 150 published book reviews from different disciplines in English and Turkish. In order to understand how writers engaged in their reviews and interacted with their readers, Hyland's (2000) metadiscourse model was used to identify interpersonal markers in book reviews. With a focus of five common features from this model, hedges, emphatics (boosters), attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers were used as categories to be investigated. Relying on a quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative analysis, {{it was found that the}} total number of interpersonal metadiscourse features was considerably higher in the English corpus than in the Turkish corpus. Two languages showed variations particularly in the use of hedging devices which help writers to tone down their statements. Particularly learners in academic contexts can gain awareness of how various <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> are realized in different cultures based on the findings...|$|R

I discuss questions of gender from a dual perspective: in the first, as an autobiographical <b>academic,</b> hybrid, <b>genre,</b> which is characterized by its position {{between the public and}} the private, interlacing institutional injunction (evaluation), with autobiographical seduction (self- awareness); the second perspective examines the transformation of this genre through female/feminist writing and empowerment as an historical apex, due to {{the increase in the number}} of women in higher education and the use of these writings in pedagogical practices of teacher training.

40|$|Literature of {{academic}} writing within the genre theory and English for academic purposes (EAP) reveals that student academic writing is less researched {{compared to the}} research conducted on expert writing (e. g., Swales, 1990, Hyland, 2000). Research on student writing in business studiesseems to be particularly scarce in the literature. Previous studies have only classified <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> business students produce in the academy (e. g., Canseco & Byrd, 1989, Cooper & Bikowski, 2007) into broader labels such as library research papers, article reviews, business reports, etc. Although this broad labelling is a good step in mapping the type of writing {{students are asked to}} produce in university settings, it seems, however, that we still need more studies that go beyond the mere labelling of the student-produced <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and try to investigate the various socio-contextual factors underlying the production of these genres. The present study therefore attempts to go in this direction. In this paper, I will report on results obtained from a qualitative interview-based study on a Master’s level student writing in the Accounting and Finance programme at the Essex School of Accounting, Finance and Management. Three compulsory courses on the programme were the focus of the investigation. The paper will try to answer the following three research questions: (I) what types of writing are students asked to produce on the accounting and finance programme? (II) i...|$|R

Situated at the academic-commercial interface, the JD provides information for prospective readers and authors while endorsing a particular view of the field and positioning the journal in the academic community. This brief missive, often no more than 150 - 300 words, is a general specification of how the editors wish to position the journal, providing information on its scope, aims and readership. It offers the editor's evaluation of both the journal and the field it helps construct, identifying the key features of the publication and the place it occupies in the disciplinary firmament. A part of every <b>academic</b> journal, this <b>genre</b> therefore has an importance beyond its brevity; assisting novice writers, experienced researchers, and disciplinary outsiders not only in making submissions and targeting research, but in understanding something about the field and the place of the journal within it. Drawing on a corpus of 200 JDs from journals in four contrasting disciplines and produced by the ten leading international academic publishers, I show how evaluation influences both lexical choices and rhetorical structure in this genre.
