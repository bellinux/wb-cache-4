5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|Magdalena, a fourteen-year-old {{girl from}} a working-class Mexican American family in Echo Park, Los Angeles, attends her cousin Eileen's quinceañera, an extravagant coming-of-age {{ceremony}} to celebrate her fifteenth birthday. Eileen's older brother Carlos—who has been disowned {{by his family}} due to his homosexuality and now lives with his great-uncle Tomas—arrives at the celebrations but is forced to leave by his father. Magdalena herself is about to turn fifteen but her parents cannot afford to host a quinceañera as lavish as Eileen's, and <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> her repeated requests to hire a Hummer limousine for the occasion. While preparing for her quinceañera, Magdalena learns that she is pregnant by her friend Herman although they had only once engaged in non-penetrative intercourse. Her Christian father is furious, believing that Magdalena has had premarital sex despite her protestations that she is still a virgin. She leaves her family {{to move in with}} Tomas and Carlos and continues to see Herman until she discovers that his mother has sent him away to live with relatives to prevent him from seeing Magdalena.|$|E

25|$|In {{the play}} The Bacchae by Euripides, Dionysus {{returns to his}} birthplace, Thebes, which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus. Pentheus, his mother Agave, and his aunts Ino and Autonoe {{do not believe that}} Dionysus is a son of Zeus. Despite the {{warnings}} of the blind prophet Tiresias, <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> him worship; instead, they arraign him for causing madness among the women of Thebes.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th century, {{the liberals}} had evolved into Unitarians. Not only did <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free to believe what they wanted. When they did organize, they tended to focus on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

25|$|Hastert's office concedes, {{in its own}} chronology, {{that his}} top staffers Mike Stokke (deputy chief of staff), Ted Van Der Meid (legal counsel) and a lower placed {{assistant}} named Tim Kennedy were told about the Foley emails by Rep. Alexander's {{chief of staff in}} November 2005. <b>They</b> <b>deny</b> that Scott Palmer knew about the emails until they were made public, though. Hastert is unusually close to his top staffers; he lives with Palmer and Stokke, who have worked for him for decades, and they commute back to Illinois together on weekends.|$|E
25|$|Calvinists {{broke from}} the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinism differs from Lutherans {{on the real}} {{presence}} of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, {{and the use of}} God's law for believers, among other things. As declared in the Westminster and Second Helvetic confessions, the core doctrines are predestination and election. A basic principle is that <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> the Catholic teaching that humans can achieve salvation through their actions. The protestant part of this reformation was considering that the Bible be interpreted by itself, meaning the parts that are harder to understand are examined in the light of other passages where the Bible is more explicit on the matter. The term Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse, {{with a wide range of}} influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it referring to French reformer John Calvin, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.|$|E
25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. <b>They</b> <b>deny</b> {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E

500|$|When the Panic of 1893 {{struck in}} the {{following}} year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%, and [...] "hunger demonstrations" [...] sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated {{men and women in}} New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Union Square, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to [...] "take everything...by force", while Goldman later recounted this message: [...] "Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> you both, take bread." [...] Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.|$|E
500|$|The Reformed confessions {{teach that}} Christ's true {{body and blood}} are really present in the Lord's Supper. Regarding what is {{received}} in the Supper, the Reformed tradition does not disagree with the position of Catholicism or Lutheranism. Reformed confessions teach that partakers of the Supper, {{in the words of}} the Belgic Confession, partake of [...] "the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ". However, <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> the explanations for this eating and drinking made by Lutherans and Catholics. Against Catholics, Reformed confessions teach that the bread and wine of the Supper do not become the blood and body of Christ, as in the Catholic view of transubstantiation. Against Lutherans, Reformed confessions do not teach that partakers of the Supper physically eat Christ's body and drink his blood with their mouths (...) [...] While Reformed confessions teach that in the Supper Christ is received in both his divine and human natures, the manner of eating is believed to be spiritual (...) [...] The body and blood of Christ remain fleshly substance, but they are communicated to the partaker in a spiritual manner.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Adrian Smith of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (AS + GG) was {{selected}} as the preliminary architect (though <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> involvement in the earlier, mile-high designs). Later, when the proposal was more serious, they won a design competition between eight leading architectural firms including Kohn Pedersen Fox, Pickard Chilton, Pelli Clarke Pelli, and Foster + Partners, as well as the firm Smith formerly worked for, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which was the final competitor in the competition before AS + GG was chosen. In addition to Burj Khalifa, Adrian Smith has designed several other recent supertall towers; the Zifeng Tower in Nanjing, China, the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago, and the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, as well as the Pearl River Tower in Guangzhou, China. The four buildings are all among the top eleven tallest in the world. [...] Furthermore, the Pearl River Tower is a unique tower that was originally designed to use zero net energy by drawing all its needed power from wind, sunlight, and geothermal mass, though this design goal was not fully achieved.|$|E

500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The answer is not so much of importance to the novel, so much as the fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{people who}} are {{concerned}} with maintaining their self-esteem allege that <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> jealous feelings. [...] When individuals are motivated to reduce uncertainty about their partner, they use integrative communication, surveillance, and rival contacts to seek additional information. [...] Communicative responses to jealousy may help reduce uncertainty and restore self-esteem, but they may actually increase uncertainty and negatively impact relationships and self-esteem in some instances. The type of communicative response used is critical.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most extreme}} denialists, by and large, reject the {{findings}} of the tribunals as a kind of [...] "victor's justice" [...] in which only the winning side's version of events are accepted. [...] Described within Japan as the Illusion School (maboroshi-ha), <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> the massacre and argue that only a few POWs and civilians were killed by the Japanese military in Nanjing. [...] More moderate denialists argue that between several thousand and 38,000–42,000 were massacred.|$|E

2500|$|A more {{significant}} source of perceived discrimination is in capital investment markets. Banks are often accused of not providing loans and other financial instruments for inner-city minority owned businesses. Most research indicates that the banking {{industry as a whole}} is systemic in its abuse of the legal system in avoidance of [...] "high risk" [...] loans to minorities, pointing out that banks cannot provide facts backing up their assertions that <b>they</b> <b>deny</b> such loans to a high failure rate.|$|E
