5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E

5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new one.|$|E
5|$|The male American robin, as {{with many}} thrushes, has a complex and almost {{continuous}} song. Its song is commonly described as a cheerily carol, made up of discrete units, often repeated, and spliced <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> string with brief pauses in between. The song varies regionally, and its style varies by time of day. The song period is from late February or early March to late July or early August; some birds, particularly in the east, sing occasionally into September or later. The American robin is often among the first songbirds singing as dawn rises or hours before, and last as evening sets in. It usually sings from a high perch in a tree. The song of T. m. confinis is weaker {{than that of the}} nominate subspecies, and lacks any clear notes.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
5|$|World Tour is a single-player career {{mode that}} {{combines}} Single Races, Road Rage, Crash mode, {{and several other}} race variants {{into a series of}} 173 events spanning ten locations across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Events are presented on a navigation map and a medal is awarded for every one that is completed successfully. World Tour includes Grand Prix events that group several races <b>together</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> point-based tournament. Face-Off is a one versus one race event wherein the player is granted with opposing vehicle if they win. Burning Lap is a single lap time-trial event where the player must beat predetermined lap times. Eliminator is a five lap race in which the driver in last place {{at the end of each}} lap gets eliminated. The game features 67 vehicles which are divided into classes based on their speed. New and faster cars are unlocked by earning medals in World Tour mode and achieving milestones such as attaining a certain number of Takedowns or causing a certain amount of damage across Crash mode junctions.|$|E
