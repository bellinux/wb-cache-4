5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) greets {{his friend}} Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello) and his {{assistant}} Lt. Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) aboard the Enterprise. For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform {{an investigation of the}} Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's query causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the senior staff based on their personal logs and past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of <b>trustworthiness,</b> they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

25|$|Stethoscopes {{are often}} {{considered}} {{as a symbol of}} healthcare professionals, as various healthcare providers are often seen or depicted with stethoscopes hanging around their necks. A 2012 research paper claimed that the stethoscope, when compared to other medical equipment, had the highest positive impact on the perceived <b>trustworthiness</b> of the practitioner seen with it.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Morley {{established}} {{a reputation for}} <b>trustworthiness</b> with the local Yucatec Maya around Mérida, who were still suffering from the depredations of the Caste War of Yucatán against the Mexican government. Over the years, he was to act almost as their representative in several matters, although he was equally careful not to upset the Mexican and U.S. governments.|$|E
25|$|According to him, {{evaluating}} {{intentions of}} any person or subject based upon its visuals or an external appearance might ultimately have enforced <b>trustworthiness,</b> {{which is a}} crucial factor for an interpersonal relationship. Draft of this hypothesis was conveyed by him through an email to more than 100 scientists and researchers from many renowned universities, research laboratories and institutions. This hypothesis is still to be testified by scientific community.|$|E
25|$|Albrekt Larsen has {{advanced}} this explanation by a {{comparative study of}} how trust increased in Denmark and Sweden {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century while it decreased in the US and UK. It is argued that inequality levels influence how citizens imagine the <b>trustworthiness</b> of fellow citizens. In this model social trust is not about relations to people you meet (as in Putnam's model) but about people you imagine.|$|E
25|$|Around 1225, {{the nation}} of Ma-i, a pre-Hispanic Philippine island-state {{centered}} in Mindoro, flourished as an entrepôt, attracting traders and shipping from the Kingdom of Ryukyu to the Empire of Japan. Chao Jukua, a customs inspector in Fukien province, China wrote the Zhufan Zhi ("Description of the Barbarous Peoples"), which described trade with this pre-colonial Philippine state. Its people were noted for their honesty and <b>trustworthiness</b> in trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{criteria}} Hume lists in his {{examination of}} the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology, under the rubric of the communication-persuasion paradigm. Supporting literature includes: the work of social impact theory, which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence; as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator credibility in different kinds of persuasion; and examinations of the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the speaker.|$|E

Also the address bar features a color code to visually indicate the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the page. The address bar turns red when a page, with invalid security certificate, is accessed. In case of sites not using any encryption, the address bar is white. And if the page uses high security certificate, the bar turns green.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the Companions' efforts in narrating their hadith, {{there was no need}} for them to {{evaluate}} each other's narrating capabilities or <b>trustworthiness.</b> This is because, as Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the Companions to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them. However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the Followers with some criticism of specific individuals from them.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} {{need to apply}} costly techniques such as formal verification or manual review, {{the size of the}} TCB has immediate consequences on the economics of the TCB assurance process, and the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the resulting product (in terms of the mathematical expectation of the number of bugs not found during the verification or review). In order to reduce costs and security risks, the TCB should therefore be kept as small as possible. This is a key argument in the debate preferring microkernels to monolithic kernels.|$|E
25|$|Smith's second allegation, of {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} between the Prince of Wales and Fawcett, was repeated in a legal statement issued by him to the Mail on Sunday newspaper. Fawcett took a High Court injunction to prevent their disclosure. The injunction was granted. The Guardian newspaper sought and received permission from the courts on 6 November 2003 to name Fawcett as the party granted the injunction. In response, the Prince's Private Secretary issued a statement denying the allegations and questioning the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the unnamed Smith as a source.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 study Hartley {{and colleagues}} at the University of York {{reported}} that impressions of the traits of approachability, youthfulness/attractiveness and dominance can be formed {{in as little as}} 100 milliseconds, from measurable characteristics such as the shape of and the spacing around the eyes, nose and mouth. it was found that first impressions of social traits, such as <b>trustworthiness</b> or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces. Physical facial features were objectively measured from feature positions and colours. A neural network was the used to model factor the dimensions of approachability, youthful-attractiveness and dominance. 58% of the variance in raters’ impressions was accounted for by a linear model.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the unique}} aspects to the school culture is the total absence of caning. Instead the school {{emphasizes}} promoting virtues like patience, diligence, courtesy, <b>trustworthiness,</b> compassion and justice, {{while at the same}} time helping students developed the capacities, attitudes and skills - such as knowledge of appropriate agricultural techniques, computer literacy and basic commerce. The school also has a strong sense of mission when it comes to educating girls and proudly note its record of academic excellence. As part of the student government of the school, the Environmental Ambassadors project acts as a force in keeping the environment in pleasant condition. In every Form there are a number of Environmental Ambassadors chosen from volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Organizational {{culture has}} been {{described}} as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations. Organizational {{culture has been}} shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the <b>trustworthiness</b> and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{agreed to}} {{recognize}} the territory to Lithuania if it agreed to form a military alliance against Poland, which was engaged in the Kiev Offensive against the Soviet Russia. The Lithuanians were tempted by the opportunity to regain Vilnius, but refused. Even though the Soviets seemed a natural ally against Poland, Lithuanians reasoned that staying on good terms with Poland and its allies, France and Great Britain, was a better long-term strategy. Lithuania informed Britain about Soviet plans. They hoped {{such a move would}} prove Lithuania's <b>trustworthiness</b> and would put indirect pressure on Poland to reach an acceptable agreement in regards to Vilnius. These tactics did not prove successful, as Poland was invariably backed by France and indirect British pressure was not strong enough to change Poland's foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{different}} qualities are detected in first impressions {{may be linked to}} what has been important to survival from an evolutionary perspective. For example, <b>trustworthiness</b> and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated in a study of human faces. People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general, but {{there appears to be a}} difference in first impression judgments between older and younger adults. Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier, more trustworthy, and less hostile, but more aggressive, than younger adults did of the same photos. Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed, causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} Toronto Star column {{stated that}} most contributors to online discussions agreed {{there was a}} smear campaign against Layton. As for political damage from this story, that same day's update of the Nanos Leadership Index, which assesses public opinion on the Canadian federal leaders' <b>trustworthiness,</b> competence and vision for Canada, Layton rose from 80% to 97%, surpassing Harper at 88% and Ignatieff at 39%. The polling company speculated this improvement is due to strong sympathy by the public for a political candidate they judged as being unfairly maligned. The Toronto police launched an investigation into how official police notes were leaked to Sun Media. Police notebooks are closely guarded and may contain unfounded and unproven allegations. On May 5, 2011, {{it was announced that}} no charges would be laid with regards to the leaked information.|$|E
25|$|The nearly {{simultaneous}} {{invasions of}} Honduras in 1524 by rival Spanish expeditions began {{an era of}} conflict among rival Spanish claimants {{as well as with}} the indigenous population. The major initial expeditions were led by Gil González Dávila, who hoped to carve out a territory for his own rule, and by Cristóbal de Olid, who was dispatched from Cuba by Cortés. Once in Honduras, however, Olid succumbed to personal ambition and attempted to establish his own independent authority. Word of this reached Cortés in Mexico, and to restore his own authority, he ordered yet another expedition, this one under the command of Francisco de Las Casas. Then, doubting the <b>trustworthiness</b> of any subordinate, Cortés set out for Honduras himself. The situation was further complicated by the entry into Honduras of expeditions from Guatemala under Pedro de Alvarado and from Nicaragua under Hernando de Soto.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's <b>trustworthiness</b> and credibility in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{vandalism}} a wiki receives {{depends on how}} open the wiki is. For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their IP addresses, to edit content, while others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account, but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the English Wikipedia, registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits. Other wikis such as the Portuguese Wikipedia use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made {{a certain number of}} edits to prove their <b>trustworthiness</b> and usefulness as an editor. Vandalism of Wikipedia is common (though policed and usually reverted) because it is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, although this makes it grow rapidly. In contrast, Citizendium requires an editor's real name and short autobiography, affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism.|$|E

The headquarters of the Pacific Air Force launched an investigation of the apparent failure and reported that [...] "our estimates were in error." [...] The report went on to state, however, that the lapse was not the result any failure of the sensors themselves, but the Air Force's false assumption that the trail net had adequate coverage.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 12th century, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus wrote down or invented a legend about the Piast dynasty. Amid miraculous details, the story offers {{the names of}} the {{supposed}} ancestors of the royal family, beginning with a man named Chościsko, the father of the central figure Piast the Wheelwright, who was a humble farmer living in Gniezno and married to Rzepka. According to Gallus, the male heads of the Piast clan following after him were Siemowit, Lestek, Siemomysł and Mieszko I, the first [...] "Piast" [...] known with historic certainty. Gallus expressed his own misgivings concerning the <b>trustworthiness</b> of the royal story he passed on, but he did consider the sequence of the last three names of Mieszko's predecessors to be reliable.|$|E

These experiences, along {{with an emphasis on}} <b>trustworthiness</b> and personal honor, help to develop responsibility, character, self-reliance, self-confidence, reliability, and readiness; which eventually lead to collaboration and leadership. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as dexterity. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.|$|E

Beginning the game with the placeholder name , Cloud assists AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace, in bombing a Mako reactor, power plants which drain the planet's [...] "Lifestream". Cloud claims to be formerly of SOLDIER 1st Class, an elite Shinra fighting unit. Cloud takes pride in his past and boasts of the abilities of its members. However, his background produces misgivings as to his allegiances and <b>trustworthiness,</b> and Cloud's blasé attitude towards the goals of AVALANCHE creates further tension.

When approached by his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member, Tifa Lockhart, about accepting another job, Cloud at first refuses. However, when confronted with his boyhood promise to protect her were he to become a famous hero, Cloud agrees to continue helping AVALANCHE, despite neither having become famous nor a hero.|$|E
500|$|When Irataba {{returned}} {{he informed}} Ives {{that he would}} not venture any deeper into the territory of the Hualapais, but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in the region before parting company. Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons. After enlisting three Hualapai guides, Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community. On April 4, the Mohave received payment for their services; Möllhausen described the exchange: [...] "Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the 'Great Grandfather in Washington' to give him two mules... for his loyalty and his <b>trustworthiness</b> so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley." [...] The next morning, as they were preparing to leave: [...] "Irataba was visibly moved... and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature... I maintain that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with... a harmless soul leave." ...|$|E

[...] Olson then argues [...] " [...] {{that these two}} types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness." [...] She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with <b>trustworthiness</b> and ends with unreliability. This model allows for all shades of grey in between the poles of <b>trustworthiness</b> and unreliability.
