The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride lot in the southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> onto US 301, perform a U-turn, then <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> again to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Doctor and Donna {{exploring}} a marketplace on the Asian styled planet Shan Shen. Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was driving along with her mother, Sylvia, through London {{to get a new}} job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to turn left to get to the security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E

5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{the first}} M-108 {{designation}} was commissioned along a rare three-legged route connecting the State Highway Ferry Docks with the Fort Michilimackinac State Historic Park and US 31. At one point while traveling westbound on M-108, motorists could <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> onto northbound M-108 or left onto southbound M-108. In {{preparation for the}} opening of the Mackinac Bridge, the Michigan State Highway Department transferred all of M-108 to local control in late 1957, decommissioning the designation at the same time. In 1960, the current M-108 was commissioned along the final routing.|$|E

5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, <b>turn</b> <b>right,</b> and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September, {{the brigade}} {{was once again}} moved to the front line and given {{responsibility}} for patrolling the area between the Desert Mounted Corps and the XXI Corps, taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October. At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps, remaining Army Troops. The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives, then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline, <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at Nuzzle. When the battle started, the British infantry captured {{all but one of}} their objectives, but as the brigade started to move out, a Turkish counter-attack regained their previous positions, so the brigade's advance was called off. However, by the night of 6/7 November, continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them. By 13:00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard, which included a heavy machine-gun position. At 15:00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked Beit Hanun, {{while the rest of the}} brigade attacked Beit Lahi. As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective, they came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Leaving one squadron and their machine-guns behind to provide fire support, the rest of the Lancers attacked, capturing the Wadi Safieh line. The Lancers, still under artillery fire, held out until 16:30, when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi.|$|E

2500|$|At intersections where U-turns are {{permitted}} {{and controlled by}} a U-turn arrow from the left-most lane, motorists <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> on red onto the same road must yield to those making U-turns before turning, as the motorists making U-turns have {{the right of way}} and a collision could easily occur. At intersections where U-turns are prohibited in the same fashion, a green <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> arrow will sometimes appear with the red light for those <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> onto the road, allowing only traffic <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> to proceed without having to stop or yield to other vehicles or pedestrians. Some states such as California have [...] "No U-Turn" [...] signs posted at these intersections because of the green <b>right</b> <b>turn</b> arrow.|$|R

25|$|Through most of Canada, {{a driver}} may <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> {{at a red}} light after coming to a {{complete}} stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre did not result in significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> on a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists are reminded of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, {{red lights}} {{can be avoided}} by <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> on red (or left in drive-on-the-left countries), making a U-turn, and then <b>turning</b> <b>right</b> (or left) again back on to the street on which the {{motorist}} was traveling.

25|$|Most of Jackson's {{men were}} unaware of the small action {{at the rear of}} their column. As they marched north on Brock Road, Jackson was {{prepared}} to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> on the Orange Plank Road, from which his men would attack the Union lines at around Wilderness Church. However, it became apparent that this direction would lead to essentially a frontal assault against Howard's line. Fitzhugh Lee met Jackson and they ascended a hill with a sweeping view of the Union position and Jackson was delighted to see that Howard's men were resting, unaware of the impending Confederate threat. Although by now it was 3 p.m., Jackson decided to march his men two miles farther and <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> on the Turnpike instead, allowing him to strike the unprotected flank directly. The attack formation consisted of two lines—the divisions of Brig. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Raleigh E. Colston—stretching almost a mile {{on either side of the}} turnpike, separated by 200 yards, followed by a partial line with the arriving division of A.P. Hill.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania, {{drivers are}} allowed to <b>turn</b> <b>right</b> on red when a {{particular}} sign with a green arrow on a white background is mounted beside the red light of the traffic signal.
