40|$|Abstract- The {{transmission}} system operator (TSO) is re-sponsible {{for keeping the}} balance between production and consumption in the power system. In order to do so, the TSO continuously trades power on <b>the</b> so-called <b>regulating</b> market. Hydropower is a flexible power source well suited for trading on <b>the</b> <b>regulating</b> market because it allows fast changes in generation output. This paper describes an optimization model for creating optimal bidding strategies for <b>the</b> <b>regulating</b> market from a hydropower producer perspective. The model is based on nonlinear stochastic programming, where <b>the</b> <b>regulating</b> market prices are considered stochastic variables. The model also includes generation of regulating power price scenarios and scenario tree construction...|$|R

For this purpose, an algorithm named as “rolling balance” has been developed for this study which emulates the real-time control room response while activating <b>the</b> <b>regulating</b> bids.|$|R
