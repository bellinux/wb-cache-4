5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for his attendance {{may have been}} to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
5|$|Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which {{although}} it ordered Wilfrid's restoration {{and the return}} of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained. Wilfrid was, however, given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected. The council had been called to deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid's concerns were not the sole focus of the council. In fact, the historian Henry Chadwick thought <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid's support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy. Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12. Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{called a}} New England Woman’s Rights Convention in Boston on June 2, 1854, to expand her petitioning efforts. The {{convention}} adopted her resolution for petitioning all six New England legislatures, {{as well as}} her proposed form of petition, and it appointed a committee in each state to organize the work. In a speech before the second New England Woman’s Rights Convention, held in June, 1855, Stone urged <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> women needed suffrage was to protect any gains achieved, reminding them that “the next Legislature may undo all that the last have done for women.” The convention adopted a resolution calling the ballot “woman’s sword and shield; the means of achieving and protecting all other civil rights” and another urging the national convention to make suffrage petitioning its priority.|$|E

5|$|The Royalists, while losing fewer soldiers, {{were now}} in a {{precarious}} position, since reinforcements from Chester were needed {{to follow up on}} the success and defeat Poyntz's force. As such, Langdale sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Shakerley to report to Charles, requesting reinforcements. Shakerley arrived in Chester and delivered his message after 15 minutes, but no orders were issued for a further six hours after that. Barratt speculates <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> could have been the fatigue of the Royalist troops, and another the rivalries amongst the Royalist commanders: Gerard and Digby opposed each other, with other commanders disliking Langdale; and Charles not being strong enough to stop the disputes. The Parliamentarians, however, did send support: at approximately 2:00pm, the Chester forces dispatched 350 horse and 400 musketeers under Colonels Michael Jones and John Booth to reinforce Poyntz.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{was sent}} off for {{receiving}} two yellow cards against Manchester United on 28 October 2012, the second for diving, leaving Chelsea with nine men after teammate Branislav Ivanović was also sent off; the team {{went on to}} lose 3–2. Torres scored his first goal in the Champions League for the season after deflecting Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov's clearance into goal, as Chelsea needed a 94th-minute winner from Victor Moses to secure a 3–2 victory on 7 November 2012. On 21 November 2012, Roberto Di Matteo was replaced as Chelsea manager by Rafael Benítez, who had previously coached Torres at Liverpool. It was reported <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Benítez's appointment was to help Torres return to his best form.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's {{network of}} monasteries {{extended}} across {{at least three}} of the kingdoms of England in his day. They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle, as well as possibly Peterborough, Brixworth, Evesham, Wing, and Withington. At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome, travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120followers. He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for fostering, and Wilfrid was known to help his protégés, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian Peter Brown speculated <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron. His contacts extended to the Lombard kingdom in Italy, where they included King Perctarit and his son Cunipert.|$|E

5|$|Harold's defeat was {{probably}} due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September {{also contributed to the}} defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although {{it is not clear that}} the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} {{excluding}} Oswiu from {{any role in}} Wighard's election {{is based on the}} theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection. The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric. Brooks points out <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} various {{opinions}} regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches. After the Brazilian national team defeated Canada's side 3–2 in 2008, Brazil's coach commented <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for his team's unexpectedly poor performance was the loosely installed grass field. The Grenada national team struggled {{to cope with}} the artificial surface during their loss at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In July 2009, the U.S. Soccer Federation chose D.C. United's RFK Stadium over CenturyLink Field for the U.S. Open Cup. The general manager of D.C. United speculated that RFK's grass field {{was one of the reasons}} his team had a stronger bid. The general manager of the Sounders, Adrian Hanauer, told The Seattle Times in 2010 that replacement of the surface was a continuing conversation between the Sounders and Allen's Vulcan Inc. When the Los Angeles Galaxy traveled to Seattle in May 2012, the FieldTurf was noted as one of the reasons David Beckham and Robbie Keane were left out of the line-up.|$|E

25|$|The gold {{content of}} {{naturally}} occurring electrum in modern Western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, {{in contrast to}} the 45–55% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from seigniorage by issuing currency with a lower gold content than the commonly circulating metal.|$|E
25|$|Sufism {{is popular}} in such African {{countries}} as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal, {{where it is}} seen as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi. Mbacke suggests <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical.|$|E

25|$|Keck argues <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for {{the neglect}} of Fantasio was {{that it has been}} {{difficult}} to locate a performing edition; only a vocal score was published {{at the time of the}} premiere, along with a corrupt and re-orchestrated German version. Keck's researches have assembled many difficult to access manuscripts for a projected critical edition (Offenbach Edition Keck – OEK), leading to his claim that Fantasio is a rich and rounded masterpiece by the composer, and an important step towards his opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{have considered the}} above machinations of the Nadir {{as a reason for}} the battle. According to Montgomery Watt, their intriguing and use of their wealth to incite tribes against Muhammad left him no choice but to attack. Vaglieri concurs <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for attack was that the Jews of Khaybar were responsible for the Confederates that attacked Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. Shibli Numani also sees Khaybar's actions during the Battle of the Trench, and draws particular attention to Banu Nadir's leader Huyayy ibn Akhtab, who had gone to the Banu Qurayza during the battle to instigate them to attack Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|After {{disagreement}} regarding Stalin's {{demand to}} move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on 21 August, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the pretext {{that the absence}} of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August. Regarding the larger issue of collective security, some historians state <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> that Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France (hon hon hon baguette fromage oui oui) and Britain (England is my city) by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Stalin may also have viewed the pact as gaining time in an eventual war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.|$|E

500|$|Adamson said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for its {{popularity}} {{is that it}} matches [...] "an underlying rationale for many people's belief in God", which he contrasted with Anselm's ontological argument, formulated a few years later, which read more like a [...] "clever trick" [...] than a philosophical justification of one's faith. Professor of medieval philosophy Jon McGinnis said that the argument requires only a few premises, namely, {{the distinction between the}} necessary and the contingent, that [...] "something exists", and that a set subsists through their members (an assumption McGinnis said to be [...] "almost true by definition").|$|E
500|$|Whittall {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Britten's enduring {{popularity is}} the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music.

Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been {{out of step with the}} times".

After the pope absolved Foliot's excommunication in early 1170, Becket exclaimed to a cardinal that [...] "Satan is unloosed for the destruction of the Church". A modern biographer of Becket, the historian Frank Barlow, feels <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for Becket's change in behaviour after his election as archbishop was due to his need to [...] "out-bishop" [...] the other bishops, and prevent Foliot from making any more jibes about his inadequacies as an ecclesiastic.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} on Aristotle’s account {{practical}} thinking is thinking whose origin (archē) is a desire that {{has as its}} object the very thing <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>reasons</b> about how to promote. This feature distinguishes practical from productive reasoning since in the latter the desire that initiates it is not (unless incidentally) a desire for the object <b>that</b> <b>one</b> productively <b>reasons</b> about. The feature has several interesting consequences: (a) {{there is only a}} contingent relationship between the desire <b>that</b> <b>one</b> practically <b>reasons</b> about how to satisfy and the action one decides on; (b) practical thinking and action cannot be separated from the agent, whereas productive thinking and production can be outsourced to someone else. The view has consequences also for the distinction between action and production. Finally, I illustrate the usefulness and correctness of my account of practical thinking by using it to shed new light on Aristotle’s claim that the virtuous agent must decide on her virtuous actions ‘for themselves’...|$|R
