40|$|A unique eye color, called <b>tiger-eye,</b> segregates in the Puerto Rican Paso Fino (PRPF) horse breed and is {{characterized}} by a bright yellow, amber, or orange iris. Pedigree analysis identified a simple autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for this trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 24 individuals identified a locus on ECA 1 reaching genome-wide significance (Pcorrected = 1. 32 × 10 − 5). This ECA 1 locus harbors the candidate gene, Solute Carrier Family 24 (Sodium/Potassium/Calcium Exchanger), Member 5 (SLC 24 A 5), with known roles in pigmentation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Humans with compound heterozygous mutations in SLC 24 A 5 have oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 6 (OCA 6), which {{is characterized}} by dilute skin, hair, and eye pigmentation, as well as ocular anomalies. Twenty <b>tiger-eye</b> horses were homozygous for a nonsynonymous mutation in exon 2 (p. Phe 91 Tyr) of SLC 24 A 5 (called here <b>Tiger-eye</b> 1), which is predicted to be deleterious to protein function. Additionally, eight of the remaining 12 <b>tiger-eye</b> horses heterozygous for the p. Phe 91 Tyr variant were also heterozygous for a 628 bp deletion encompassing all of exon 7 of SLC 24 A 5 (c. 875 - 340 _ 1081 + 82 del), which we will call here the <b>Tiger-eye</b> 2 allele. None of the 122 brown-eyed horses were homozygous for either tiger-eye-associated allele or were compound heterozygotes. Further, neither variant was detected in 196 horses from four related breeds not known to have the <b>tiger-eye</b> phenotype. Here, we propose that two mutations in SLC 24 A 5 affect iris pigmentation in <b>tiger-eye</b> PRPF horses. Further, unlike OCA 6 in humans, the <b>Tiger-eye</b> 1 mutation in its homozygous state or as a compound heterozygote (<b>Tiger-eye</b> 1 /Tiger-eye 2) does not appear to cause ocular anomalies or a change in coat color in the PRPF horse...|$|E

50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Reba- a smart, intelligent, charming and independent fashion model. The special feature which makes her attractive is her eyes. She has unique <b>tiger-eyes</b> or cat-eyes. Her beauty {{helped her to}} support her family when her father died {{and she was the}} eldest besides her mother who was in the hospital. Reba was very attached to her family and to save her mother she decided to take up modelling. Her modelling career took her to great heights. She had several feathers in her cap. In her journey she also came in touch with many gentlemen. Out of these gentlemen was a man of a royal family- Eliot Thorson III. THis man was in his late twenties, tall, tanned, with blue eyes and golden hair. He had inherited a great fortune and a well-known chain of hotels. He had a false impression on Reba of being generous. On one fine evening, he proposed Reba to which Reba answered that she would tell her reply after her photo shoot. This photo shoot was going to continue for weeks and on her first day she met a dark, strong, muscular person with whom she fell in love at first sight- Hunter Jamieson. The love blossoms between both of them but the destiny shows her true colours and it is learnt that Reba's mother is critical and needed money as soon as she can for operation. Reba does {{not know what to do}} and at that moment she thinks that the only way her mother could be alive was Reba sacrificing her love and marrying Eliot. Reba decided that Hunter had to move on in life and for him she made him hate her. Hunter thought of her to be a gold-digger. With a stone of her heart, she returned to Eliot and got engaged to him. Only before a few months of marriage Eliot decided to let Reba meet his family. Reba was in no trouble until she came to know that Hunter was Eliot's cousin and had inherited the same amount of property as Eliot had. Blackmailing Reba again and again, Hunter made Reba break her engagement and after breaking the engagement she came to know that Eliot was a cheat and was double-dating. Now as the engagement was no more, Reba couldn't get the money and to save the situation Hunter offered Reba to be his mistress. He would pay her for having sex with him. Reba accepted the offer and fulfilled her part but Hunter did not pay her. To get the money, Reba went to Hunter but he carried her off to some place. Later learning that it was her mother he has got to meet, Reba thanks him and both of them live happily ever after.|$|R
