25|$|Johnson {{was honored}} {{with a state}} funeral in which Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him at the Capitol. The final {{services}} took place on January 25. The funeral {{was held at the}} National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by former Japanese prime minister Eisaku Satō, who served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency. Eulogies were given by the Rev. Dr. George Davis, the church's pastor, and W. Marvin Watson, former postmaster general. Nixon did not speak, though he attended, as is customary for presidents during state funerals, but the eulogists <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> lauded him for his tributes, as Rusk did the day before, as Nixon mentioned Johnson's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.|$|E

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore. He later recalled, [...] "I realized that the whole episode was framed around Byers telling his story to a Baltimore homicide detective. So I figured 'what the heck? Homicides a great show, so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in my backyard, and [...] I just <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} Deputies Committee meeting on {{terrorism}} held in April 2001, Clarke strongly {{suggested that the}} U.S. put pressure on both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by arming the Northern Alliance and other groups in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, that they target bin Laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the MQ-1 Predators. To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not do all these things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor. Just because FBI and CIA have failed to find the linkages does not mean they don't exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schulz's {{main goal}} for a Peanuts-based Christmas special was {{to focus on}} the true meaning of Christmas. He desired to {{juxtapose}} this theme with interspersed shots of snow and ice-skating, perhaps inspired by his own childhood growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He also created the idea for the school play, and mixing jazz with traditional Christmas carols. Schulz was adamant about Linus' reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendez's concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television. Melendez recalled Schulz <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> remarked [...] "If we don't do it, who will?". Schulz's estimation proved accurate, and in the 1960s, less than 9 percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind. It could also be worth noting that the Linus's recitation of Scripture was incorporated {{in such a way that}} it forms the climax of the film, thus making it impossible to successfully edit out.|$|E

'Pray, Mr Brick,' said Martin, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> {{asking a}} {{question}} more for conversation's sake than from any feeling of interest in its subject, 'who is that;' {{he was going to}} say 'young' but thought it prudent to eschew the word--'that very short gentleman yonder, with the red nose?' ...|$|R

"Now don't be angry, old fellow," [...] said Scatcherd, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> {{looking at}} <b>him</b> with a countenance quite {{different}} from any that he had shown that day; a countenance {{in which there was}} a show of manhood,--some show also of affection.

2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> snapped, [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E

50|$|Walter Biemel recollects that Heidegger much {{appreciated}} Dragomir's brightness.

Dragomir {{was a close friend}} of Biemel, with whom he translated “What is metaphysics? ” into Romanian (in 1942).|$|R
