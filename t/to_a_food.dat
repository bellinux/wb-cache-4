5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series}} of loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E

5|$|Seton Hall offers {{multiple}} dining options {{ranging from}} a traditional cafeteria <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> court. Some options include Build Your Own Burgers (BYOB) and Dunkin Donuts. In 2013, University officials decided that meat would not be served in the cafeteria on Ash Wednesday and Fridays during the liturgical season of Lent in practice of the abstinence of meat during the Lenten season. In 2014, the policy was implemented to all on-campus eateries.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{economic}} growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained {{the largest number}} of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005; under its later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's {{children under the age of}} five are underweight. According <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Food</b> and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India is perceived to have increased significantly, with one report estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{dramatic}} loss of any group of animals has been to wading birds. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets (Egretta thula), roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) were hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50years actions by the C further disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
