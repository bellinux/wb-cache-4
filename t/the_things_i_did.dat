To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} the Titan's Training Camp in Clarksville & Nashville, Tennessee which started July 25. Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E

I don't think <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> were bad in themselves--brought up as I have been, they could hardly be so. I knew what merits praise and blame too well for that--but oh! the motive. I do believe I cared very much for Cocksmoor. I {{thought it would be a}} grand thing to bring about; but, you see, as it has turned out, all I thought I had done for it was in vain; and Ethel has been the real person and does not know it. I used to think Ethel so inferior to me. I left her all my work at home. If it had not been for that, she might have been happy with Norman Ogilvie--for never were two people better matched, and now she has done what I never thought to have left to another--watched over our own Margaret. Oh! how shall I ever bear to see her?" ...|$|E
