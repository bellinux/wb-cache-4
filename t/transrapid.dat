25|$|This shows <b>Transrapid</b> train {{sets are}} likely to cost over {{twice as much as}} ICE 3 {{conventional}} fast rail train sets at this time. However each <b>Transrapid</b> train set is more than twice as efficient due to their faster operating speed and acceleration according to UK Ultraspeed. In their case study only 44% as many <b>Transrapid</b> train sets are needed to deliver the same amount of passengers as conventional high-speed trains.|$|E
25|$|From a {{competition}} standpoint, the <b>Transrapid</b> is a proprietary solution. The track {{being a part}} of the engine, only the single-source <b>Transrapid</b> vehicles and infrastructure can be operated. There is no multisourcing foreseen concerning vehicles or the highly complicated crossings and switches. Unlike classical railways or other infrastructure networks,as jointly administrated by the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) in Germany, a <b>Transrapid</b> system does not allow any direct competition.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 2006, a <b>Transrapid</b> train {{collided}} with a maintenance vehicle on a test/publicity run in Lathen (Lower Saxony / north-western Germany). Twenty-three {{people were killed and}} ten were injured; these were the first maglev crash fatalities. The accident was caused by human error. Charges were brought against three <b>Transrapid</b> employees after a year-long investigation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Transrapid</b> is an {{electrically}} driven, clean, high-speed, high-capacity {{means of}} transport able to build up point-to-point passenger connections in geographically challenged surroundings. This has to be set {{in comparison with the}} impact on heritage and or landscape protection areas (compare Waldschlösschen Bridge). Any impact of emissions has {{to take into account the}} source of electrical energy. The reduced expense, noise and vibration of a people-only <b>Transrapid</b> system versus a cargo train track is not directly comparable. The reuse of existing tracks and the interfacing with existing networks is limited. The <b>Transrapid</b> indirectly competes for resources, space and tracks in urban and city surroundings with classical urban transport systems and high speed trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} {{developed}} and marketed by <b>Transrapid</b> International, {{a joint venture}} of Siemens and ThyssenKrupp.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Transrapid</b> maglev vehicle {{requires}} {{less power}} to hover than {{it needs to}} run its on-board air conditioning equipment.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} {{it is not}} {{possible}} to say whether <b>Transrapid</b> or conventional fast rail track would be cheaper for a particular application.|$|E
25|$|To date, the Emsland test {{facility}} {{remains the only}} existing <b>Transrapid</b> track in Germany. It has since been deactivated and {{is scheduled to be}} disassembled.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transrapid</b> claims {{their system}} has very low {{maintenance}} costs compared to conventional {{high speed rail}} systems due to the non-contact nature of their system.|$|E
25|$|The current application-ready version, the <b>Transrapid</b> 09, is {{designed}} for a cruising speed of 500km/h (311mph) and allows acceleration and deceleration of approximately 1m/s2 (2.24mph/s).|$|E
25|$|These trains use superconducting magnets, {{which allow}} for a larger gap, and repulsive/attractive-type {{electrodynamic}} suspension (EDS). In comparison <b>Transrapid</b> uses conventional electromagnets and attractive-type electromagnetic suspension (EMS).|$|E
25|$|Max Bögl, {{a german}} {{construction}} company {{has built a}} testtrack in Sengenthal, Bavaria, Germany. In appearance it´s more like the German M-Bahn than the <b>Transrapid</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The only {{commercial}} implementation so far was in {{the year}} 2000, when the Chinese government ordered a <b>Transrapid</b> track to be built connecting Shanghai to its Pudong International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Critical voices, such as Rod Eddington {{refer to}} recent {{developments}} of railway and other competing technologies and draw parallels between <b>Transrapid</b> and previous high technology hypes without broad market impact outside niche applications.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September 2007, Bavaria {{announced}} a high-speed maglev-rail service from Munich to its airport. The Bavarian government signed contracts with Deutsche Bahn and <b>Transrapid</b> with Siemens and ThyssenKrupp for the €1.85 billion project.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August 2006, a <b>Transrapid</b> {{train running}} on Shanghai Maglev Line caught fire. The fire was quickly {{put out by}} Shanghai's firemen. It was {{reported}} that the vehicle's on-board batteries may have caused the fire.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Transrapid</b> vehicle {{versions}} TR08 and earlier, when travelling {{at speeds}} below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical {{connections to the}} track guideway. At vehicle speeds above , all on-board power was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the track’s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new energy transmission system, version TR09, has since been developed for <b>Transrapid,</b> in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track guideway for their on-board power needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.|$|E
25|$|SwissRapide AG in {{co-operation}} {{with the}} SwissRapide Consortium is developing and promoting an above-ground magnetic levitation (Maglev) monorail system, {{based on the}} <b>Transrapid</b> technology. The first projects planned are the lines Bern – Zurich, Lausanne – Geneva as well as Zurich – Winterthur.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{operating}} {{speed of the}} maglev system will result in more passengers being delivered over the same distance in a set time. The ability of the <b>Transrapid</b> system to handle tighter turns and steeper gradients could heavily influence a cost comparison for a particular project.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} {{advantage of}} Ringbahn is the airport express train service from Hauptbahnhof via Olympiakreuz, {{which was the}} proposed line for cancelled Munich Airport <b>Transrapid.</b> That could potentially shorten the travel time from the Hauptbahnhof on the west side, bypassing the current S2 with numerous stops along the line.|$|E
25|$|EMS {{systems such}} as HSST/Linimo can provide both {{levitation}} and propulsion using an onboard linear motor. But EDS systems and some EMS {{systems such as}} <b>Transrapid</b> levitate but do not propel. Such systems need some other technology for propulsion. A linear motor (propulsion coils) mounted in the track is one solution. Over long distances coil costs could be prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as Minister-President of Bavaria, Stoiber pushed for the {{construction}} of a roughly 40-kilometer high-speed magnetic-levitation link from Munich's main station to its airport, to be built by <b>Transrapid</b> International, a consortium including ThyssenKrupp and Munich-based Siemens. After he left office, the German federal government abandoned the plans in 2008 because of spiraling costs of as much as €3.4 billion.|$|E
25|$|The design {{called for}} five levels. The highest level, on a bridge 10 metres above street level, {{was to have}} {{platforms}} for both long-distance and S-Bahn trains on the existing Stadbahn. The lowest level, 15 metres underground, was to have platforms served by new tunnels to Potsdamer Platz under the Spree and the Tiergarten, forming a new north-south line running to {{the northern part of}} the S-Bahn ring around central Berlin. Platforms for the planned extension to U-Bahn line 5 were also included, as were platforms for the cancelled <b>Transrapid</b> maglev train.|$|E
25|$|China has the world's only {{commercial}} maglev high-speed {{train line}} in operation: The Shanghai Maglev Train, a turnkey <b>Transrapid</b> maglev demonstration line 30.5km long. The trains have a top operational speed of 430km/h and can reach a top non-commercial speed of 501km/h. It opened for operations in March 2004, and transports passengers between Shanghai's Longyang Road Metro Station and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. There {{have been numerous}} attempts to extend the line without success. A Shanghai-Hangzhou maglev line was also initially discussed but later shelved in favour of conventional high-speed rail.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{unmatched}} {{advantage in}} speed, the maglev has not gained widespread use in China's high-speed rail network {{due to high}} cost, German refusal to share technology and concerns about safety. The price tag of the Shanghai Maglev {{was believed to be}} $1.3billion and was partially financed by the German government. The refusal of the <b>Transrapid</b> Consortium to share technology and source production in China made large-scale maglev production much more costly than high-speed train technology for conventional lines. Finally, residents living along the proposed maglev route have raised health concerns about noise and electromagnetic radiation emitted by the trains, despite an environmental assessment by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences saying the line was safe. These concerns have prevented the construction of the proposed extension of the maglev to Hangzhou. Even the more modest plan to extend the maglev to Shanghai's other airport, Hongqiao, has stalled. Instead, a conventional subway line was built to connect the two airports, and a conventional high-speed rail line was built between Shanghai and Hangzhou.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Transrapid</b> {{originated}} as one {{of several}} competing concepts for new land-based high-speed public transportation developed in Germany. In this competition, the <b>Transrapid</b> primarily competed with the InterCityExpress (ICE), a high-speed rail system based on [...] "traditional" [...] railway technology. The ICE “won” {{in that it was}} adopted nationwide in Germany, however <b>Transrapid</b> development continued. A number of studies for possible <b>Transrapid</b> lines were conducted after the ICE had entered service, including a long-distance line from Hamburg to Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|The German <b>Transrapid,</b> Japanese HSST (Linimo), and Korean Rotem EMS maglevs levitate at a standstill, with {{electricity}} extracted from guideway using power rails {{for the latter}} two, and wirelessly for <b>Transrapid.</b> If guideway power is lost on the move, the <b>Transrapid</b> is still able to generate levitation down to [...] speed, using the power from onboard batteries. This {{is not the case}} with the HSST and Rotem systems.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 <b>Transrapid</b> Australia {{quoted the}} Victoria State Government between A$16.5 million (commuter) and A$20 million (luxury) per trains section or carriage. Due to the [...] {{width of the}} <b>Transrapid</b> {{carriages}} they have a floor area of about [...] This works out at between A$179,000 and A$217,000 per square meter.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Transrapid</b> is a German {{developed}} high-speed monorail train using magnetic levitation. Planning for the <b>Transrapid</b> system {{started in}} 1969 with a test facility {{for the system}} in Emsland, Germany completed in 1987. [...] In 1991, technical readiness for application {{was approved by the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn in cooperation with renowned universities.|$|E
2500|$|The normal energy {{consumption}} of the <b>Transrapid</b> is approximately [...] per section for levitation and travel, and vehicle control. The drag coefficient of the <b>Transrapid</b> is about 0.26. The aerodynamic drag of the vehicle, which has a frontal cross section of , requires a power consumption, at [...] or [...] cruising speed, given by the following formula: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Transrapid</b> was {{rejected}} in 2007 by the UK government for a maglev link between London and Glasgow, via Birmingham, Liverpool/Manchester, Leeds, Teesside, Newcastle and Edinburgh.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{classical}} railway lines, <b>Transrapid</b> allows higher speeds and gradients with lower {{wear and tear}} and even lower energy consumption and maintenance needs. The <b>Transrapid</b> track is more flexible, and therefore more easily adapted to specific geographical circumstances than a classical train system.

[...] The magnetic field generator, {{an important part of}} the engine being a part of the track, limits the system capacity.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{the first}} {{commercial}} implementation was completed— the Shanghai Maglev Train, which connects the city of Shanghai's rapid transit network [...] to Shanghai Pudong International Airport. [...] The <b>Transrapid</b> system {{has not yet been}} deployed on a long-distance intercity line.|$|E
2500|$|Plans {{to connect}} Glasgow to London by a 270mph <b>Transrapid</b> (German Maglev train) have [...] in June 2005. [...] However, this {{proposal}} {{has now been}} shelved in favour of the proposed High Speed Two scheme from London to Birmingham, which may be extended to Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 September 2006, a <b>Transrapid</b> train {{collided}} with a maintenance vehicle at [...] on the test track in Lathen. The maintenance vehicle destroyed {{the first section of}} the train, then lifted off the track to complete two full rotations before landing in a pile of pre-exploded debris. This was the first major accident involving a <b>Transrapid</b> train. The news media reported 23 fatalities and that several people were severely injured, these being the first fatalities on any maglev. The accident was caused by human error with the first train being allowed to leave the station before the maintenance vehicle had moved off the track. This situation could be avoided in a production environment by installing an automatic collision avoidance system.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 <b>Transrapid</b> Australia {{quoted the}} Victoria State Government A$34 million per {{kilometer}} for dual track. This assumed 50% {{of the track}} was at grade and 50% was elevated. In comparison, the [...] Regional Rail Link {{to be built in}} Victoria will cost A$5 billion, or A$105 million per kilometer, including two stations.|$|E
