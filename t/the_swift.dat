5|$|Aerodramus is a genus of small, dark, cave-nesting {{birds in}} the Collocaliini tribe of <b>the</b> <b>swift</b> family.

Many of its members were formerly classified in Collocalia, but were first placed in a separate genus by American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser in 1906.|$|E
50|$|In the ANZ Championship, {{many experts}} {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won't {{be able to}} reach the top 4 due to their poor performance last year. As a result, this was <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> year of redemption in hopes to return to the top (similar to the Melbourne Vixens in 2009). In round 1, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> upset <b>the</b> Firebirds at Gold Coast by three goals and Cox was named player of the match. In round 2, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won against <b>the</b> Thunderbirds at their home ground. In round 3, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> played against <b>the</b> Tactix, where <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> lost to them at Christchurch in 2008. After the end of regulation time, the game was a draw and extra time had to be played. Cox made a bold move to bench herself due to her poor performance on court for youngster Wild and <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won <b>the</b> match 56-53. In round 4, during the first half, the last place Pulse led <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> as much as seven. After trailing by five goals after the first half, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> scored <b>the</b> first ten goals in the second half and won the match 50-36. In round 5, despite conceding the first three goals against <b>the</b> Fever, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> played their best performance after five rounds to win 55-43.|$|R
50|$|In round 6, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> had a bye {{after their}} five match winning streak. It {{was in this}} round that <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> were <b>the</b> only team {{not to have a}} loss when the Vixens had a {{surprise}} loss against the Firebirds. In round 7, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> led by one goal at three quarter time, despite trailing by one goal after the first few minutes of the final quarter, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won <b>the</b> match by 14 goals. In round 8, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> defeated <b>the</b> Thunderbirds and broke their four match winning streak. In round 9, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> defeated <b>the</b> Firebirds and broke their four match winning streak as well. In round 10, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> were comfortable winners against the Fever. In round 11, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> defeated <b>the</b> Mystics and Maria Tutaia was sent off with about {{a minute and a half}} of play for persistent breaking on the centre pass. Before round 12, during training, Vanessa Ware suffered a serious knee injury that required reconstruction and not only did it end Ware's season, it also blew away any chance of possible selection into the Diamonds squad. In round 12, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> defeated <b>the</b> Magic despite them having Jade Clarke and not having Vanessa Ware. In round 13, after the scores the tied at half time, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> managed to win by 12 goals against the Vixens in Melbourne. Also during this match, not only was Catherine Cox awarded player of the match, Cox became the second player ever to play 200 games in the domestic league (the first was Sharelle McMahon) and received a bouquet of flowers from Sharelle McMahon. Also, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won back <b>the</b> Sargeant McKinnis Cup back from the Vixens. In round 14, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> defeated <b>the</b> Steel. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> were officially <b>the</b> first ever team to go undefeated in the regular season.|$|R
50|$|In the ANZ Championship, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> {{won their}} first {{game against the}} Canterbury Tactix (the only team <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> didn't win in 2008) by {{seventeen}} goals and claimed the top spot in the ladder after round one. In round two, after a well fought game against the Adelaide Thunderbirds, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> lost by one goal. In round three, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> lost by 18 goals to the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic. During that game, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> lost Bulley for falling on the ground head first, Cox after a bad landing on Tod's foot and nearly lost Pettitt after falling down heavily. Despite Cox missing one shot, Pettitt missing three shots and Bell missing two, it wasn't enough to beat van Dyk's perfect accuracy and Tutaia's one miss. In round four, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> are against <b>the</b> Northern Mystics and despite Cox missing three shots in the final quarter and scoring no rebounds against Latu (who shot 38/40), Cookey and Rasmussen, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> won 59-55 to maintain their winning streak at home. However, after that, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> lost <b>the</b> last 9 {{games in a row}} and fell down to 9th place.|$|R

He organized a group of eighteen investors in the club, including star National Hockey League players Theoren Fleury and Joe Sakic, along with Bret Hart, famous for his exploits in the World Wrestling Federation. The Calgary Flames, who had just assumed control of the then Saddledome and were looking to fill extra dates in the building, were receptive to the new team.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} (Mustela nigripes) became extirpated in Canada in 1937. Between the 1950s and 1981, it was {{suspected}} {{to be entirely}} extinct until a wild population was discovered in 1981 in Wyoming. <b>The</b> <b>swift</b> fox and sea otter both were extirpated in Canada in the 1930s, but were successfully reintroduced {{in the beginning of}} the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years.

Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} changes are minor adjustments. For instance, instead of putting <b>the</b> <b>swifts,</b> treeswifts, and {{hummingbirds}} {{in the same order}} that includes nothing else, Sibley and Ahlquist put them in the same superorder that includes nothing else, consisting of one order for the hummingbirds and another for <b>the</b> <b>swifts</b> and treeswifts. In other words, they still regard <b>the</b> <b>swifts</b> as <b>the</b> hummingbirds' closest relatives.|$|R
50|$|In Central Europe, <b>the</b> <b>swifts</b> {{return in}} <b>the</b> {{second half of}} April and the first third of May, and like to stay in {{lowlands}} and near water rather than in high places.

50|$|After {{missing out}} on a spot in last years grand final, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> {{recruited}} Mo'onia Gerrard from the Adelaide Thunderbirds. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> also recruited veteran Carla Dziwoki after making a great impact at both in state league and in the Australian National League as well as forming a great shooting combination with current Swifts player Amy Wild. <b>The</b> <b>Swifts</b> are {{one of only two}} teams not to have any new players in their team (the other is the Pulse). However, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> have used players not in the main squad during pre-season matches against the Mystics including April Letton, FastNet Diamonds defender.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>swift</b> {{outcome of}} the trial {{resulted}} in the almost immediate execution of the two men. One Driscoll, led out alone, was shot first. Then the other was led out, shown his dead relative's body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which he deserved death, and was also shot.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>swift</b> {{spread of}} Islam across Western Asia and North Africa {{encouraged}} an unprecedented growth in trade and travel by {{land and sea}} {{as far away as}} Southeast Asia, China, much of Africa, Scandinavia and even Iceland. Geographers worked to create increasingly accurate maps of the known world, starting from many existing but fragmentary sources. Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (850–934), founder of the Balkhī school of cartography in Baghdad, wrote an atlas called Figures of the Regions (Suwar al-aqalim).|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at <b>the</b> <b>Swift</b> and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
50|$|In their preseason tournament, the Sydney Olympic Park Netball Cup, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> {{won five}} of their seven {{games and the}} other two games ended in a draw. This was enough for <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> to win <b>the</b> cup and $10,000.|$|R
50|$|The New South Wales <b>Swifts</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> 2011 {{season as}} preliminary finalists. Before {{the start of}} the finals series, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> conducted a coaching review and advertised their head coaching position. Incumbent coach Julie Fitzgerald, having spent 15 years coaching <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Swifts</b> in <b>the</b> Commonwealth Bank Trophy and <b>the</b> NSW <b>Swifts</b> in <b>the</b> ANZ Championship, did not reapply for the position; Fitzgerald was later appointed as assistant coach for the Australian national team and head of the AIS Netball Program. Also departing <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> were internationals Catherine Cox (West Coast Fever) and Rebecca Bulley (Adelaide Thunderbirds). <b>The</b> <b>Swifts</b> submitted their roster for the 2012 season on 1 November 2011, with five changes to the playing lineup. Lisa Beehag was also appointed as head coach of <b>the</b> NSW <b>Swifts</b> on a one-year deal.|$|R
50|$|After a {{shocking}} performance in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> recruited England defender Sonia Mkoloma to their team. This {{is the first}} time that <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> have added an international player to their squad. They were the last team in the history of the ANZ Championship to recruit an international player (<b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> were <b>the</b> only team not to have an import player since the start of the competition). This year, the co-vice captains for the team are Kimberlee Green and Kimberly Smith. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Swifts</b> have a new assistant coach Robert Wright, current NSW Institute of Sport Development Coach. Wright is officially the first male assistant coach in the ANZ Championship history.|$|R
5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including <b>the</b> <b>swift</b> elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} up the river, {{sometimes}} in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici.

By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's first Five Nations Championship {{match of}} 1914 was on 7 February, played away to Wales at Cardiff. Scotland had not won in Cardiff since 1890 and Wales were favourites, having 'lost so unluckily' against England. The match pitted Welsh forward {{strength}} against <b>the</b> <b>swift</b> threequarter {{line of the}} Scots. The first points came from a try for Scotland by W. A. Stewart, converted by Hamilton, giving the visitors a five-point lead after four minutes. These were the only points they scored. Wales then attacked repeatedly and Wallace was kept busy in defence. With a 7–5 lead at half time, the Welsh pressed their advantage and ended the game 24–5 winners.|$|E

5|$|This {{new class}} of GRB-like events was first {{discovered}} through the detection of GRB 110328A by <b>the</b> <b>Swift</b> Gamma-Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011. This event had a gamma-ray duration of about 2 days, much longer than even ultra-long GRBs, and was detected in X-rays for many months. It occurred {{at the center of}} a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>swift</b> {{transfer}} of power following Domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, {{but at the same}} time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy. Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming <b>the</b> <b>Swift</b> Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
5|$|Dušan put Syrgiannes at {{the head}} of a large Serbian force, with which he invaded Byzantine Macedonia in 1334. Syrgiannes's {{abilities}} as a general, his knowledge of the Byzantine army's dispositions and the friendships he had maintained with several local Byzantine officers resulted in <b>the</b> <b>swift</b> capture of many important Byzantine cities, including Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, and Kastoria. The road was open for an advance towards Thessalonica, and Syrgiannes's army encamped before the walls of the city, facing a Byzantine relief force. Both sides remained encamped confronting each other for several days, but on 23 August 1334, Syrgiannes was lured away from his camp with only a few retainers and murdered by Sphrantzes Palaiologos, a Byzantine general who had defected on purpose to the Serbian camp a few days earlier. With the loss of their principal military leader, the Serbs settled for a negotiated peace with the Byzantines, which was very advantageous for them as they were left in possession of most of the cities won by Syrgiannes in northern Macedonia.|$|E
