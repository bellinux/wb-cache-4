5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk {{from one end of}} the game world <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons that they can use as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals {{belong to the same}} strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.|$|E
25|$|In summary, each of {{the four}} Gospels reports an anointing. Matthew and Mark are {{generally}} agreed <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> same event. Authorities differ as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> only in John is Mary named.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|The finest {{and most}} {{prolific}} year {{of her career}} was 1963, when she appeared {{in a number of}} leading productions. She starred alongside Burt Lancaster in Visconti's The Leopard (1963) (Il Gattopardo), portraying a village girl who married a progressive young aristocrat (Alain Delon), and played a film actress cast by a director (Marcello Mastroianni) in Federico Fellini's 8½. Both films were critically acclaimed and are often cited by critics and scholars as among the greatest films ever made. She participated in the two films during exactly the same period, frequently moving from one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> experiencing the strictly planned approach of Visconti which contrasted strongly with Fellini's much more relaxed style and his almost total reliance on improvisation. Cardinale remembered Visconti's set as having an almost religious atmosphere, everything focused on the film, far removed the outside world. Visconti needed silence for his work while Fellini preferred noise and confusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{south side}} visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was {{previously}} the airfield's armoury. The various buildings are arranged roughly {{parallel to the}} A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately 1800m from one end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> a visitor bus operates during opening hours.|$|E
50|$|Across Europe, based {{mostly on}} data from 2013 seven {{countries}} (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, and Estonia, from lowest to higher) had low levels of hospital-acquired MRSA infections compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> among countries with higher levels significant improvements had been made only in Bulgaria, Poland and the British Isles.|$|R
50|$|A Scotsman, an Englishman and an Irishman all {{ran away}} from the army together. After several days, the Scotsman saw a castle, went to it without {{speaking}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> met a lady. At his request, {{she gave him a}} meal and a bed to sleep. And then the same thing happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Englishman.|$|R
25|$|The Nintendo DS {{version of}} Shattered Dimensions differs heavily from the console and PC versions. The game instead {{features}} side-scrolling gameplay, with each Spider-Man controlling identically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> {{does not include}} the Ultimate Universe. This version also has several different bosses from the console versions, such as Amazing Tinkerer, Noir Calypso, and 2099 Silvermane.|$|R
5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path from one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France.

25|$|The quail-thrushes, jewel-babblers, {{whipbirds}} and wedgebills were traditionally {{included with}} the logrunners (Orthonyx) in the family Orthonychidae. Sometimes the Malaysian rail-babbler and blue-capped ifrit (Ifrita kowaldi) were {{also included in the}} family. In 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist found that the logrunners were not related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> included only <b>the</b> logrunners in the Orthonychidae. They treated <b>the</b> <b>others</b> as <b>the</b> subfamily Cinclosomatinae within their expanded family Corvidae.|$|R

25|$|The Principle of Rhythm {{expresses the}} idea that in {{everything}} there is manifested a measured motion, a to and from, a flow and inflow, a swing backward and forward, a pendulum-like movement. There is rhythm between every pair of opposites, or poles, and {{is closely related to}} the Principle of Polarity. It can be seen that this Principle enables transition from one pole <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> not necessarily poles of extreme opposites.|$|E
25|$|In close binary systems {{the more}} massive primary {{component}} evolves faster {{and has already}} become a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole, when the less massive companion reaches the giant state and exceeds its Roche lobe. A gas flow then develops from the companion star to the primary. Angular momentum conservation prevents a straight flow from one star <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> an accretion disk forms instead.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Tanala {{adhered to}} trial by ordeal to {{determine}} the guilt or innocence of an accused party. This typically consisted of requiring the accused to swim from one bank of a river <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> back; if attacked by a crocodile, the party was considered guilty. If found innocent, the accuser was forced to pay a fine of four zebu, of which two {{were given to the}} accused and the two others went to the king and his advisor.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Seto Inland Sea as {{transport}} line served four coastal areas: Kansai, Chūgoku, Shikoku, and eastern Kyūshū. The Seto Inland Sea provided {{each of these}} regions with local transportation and connected each region <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> far areas, including the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, Korea, and China. After Kobe port was founded in 1868 to serve foreign ships, the Seto Inland Sea became a major international waterway with connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pacific.|$|R

25|$|Mérida {{has four}} large {{internal}} roadways, which run {{from one end}} of the city <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> five smaller roadways. The largest is the combination of the Andrés Bello and Urdaneta avenues. With a length of more than , it runs from the neighborhoods of the central quarter of Mérida to the outskirts of Ejido. The other three correspond to Las Américas and Alberto Carnevali avenues; 16 de septiembre and Tulio Febres Cordero avenues; and the corridor of Los Próceres avenue.|$|E
25|$|Pedestrians {{must often}} cross {{from one side}} of a road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> in doing so may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.|$|E
25|$|Satellite radio (also called SDARS by the FCC) uses two {{proprietary}} standards instead of DAB-S, which requires users to change equipment when switching from one provider <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> prevents other competitors from offering new choices as stations {{can do on}} terrestrial radio. Had the FCC picked DAB-T for terrestrial radio, no separate satellite receiver would have been needed at all, and the only difference from DAB receivers {{in the rest of}} the world would be the need to tune S band instead of L band.|$|E

25|$|The core of Deuteronomy is the {{covenant}} that binds Yahweh and Israel by oaths of fidelity (Yahweh and Israel each faithful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other)</b> <b>and</b> obedience (Israel obedient to Yahweh). God will give Israel blessings of the land, fertility, and prosperity {{so long as}} Israel is faithful to God's teaching; disobedience will lead to curses and punishment. But, according to the Deuteronomists, Israel's prime sin is lack of faith, apostasy: contrary to the first and fundamental commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods before me") the people have entered into relations with other gods.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March the 44-gun , {{under the}} command of Captain James King, while sailing in company with Duguay Trouin, {{discovered}} two of the French ships anchored in Turks Island passage. On being spotted the two ships cut their cables and stood to the southwest, upon which Resistance gave chase. The rearmost ship, carrying 20 guns, sprang her main topmast; she surrendered after Resistance came up and fired a broadside. Resistance then gave chase <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> after enduring fire from her stern chasers, came alongside; La Coquette promptly surrendered.|$|E

50|$|Clearing {{houses were}} formed to {{facilitate}} transactions among banks. Imagine {{a city with}} ten banks. Clients of each bank deposit checks daily drawn {{on any of the}} ten banks. Those drawn on the same bank as the depositor are easily processed. But cheques drawn on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> banks need <b>to</b> be presented to each bank in order to receive payments. All ten banks might have messengers taking cheques <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> waiting for payment. That would be long and cumbersome. Clearing houses solve this problem.|$|R
