5|$|It may be {{inaccurate}} {{though to}} depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have {{had more to do}} with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans.|$|E

25|$|In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became MD PIA {{and also}} open skies from Karachi to Dubai were {{declared}} and 12 private air lines {{were allowed to}} operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance. Farooq Umar <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> fought the battle of open skies and opened up six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries along with tourists attraction 'air safari'. He also made major changes in routes and schedules and started non stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada. PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku and Al-Ain to its destinations in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus. 'Air Safari' flights were launched in 1994 using Boeing 737–300 aircraft that used to fly over the Karakoram mountain range. Farooq Umar handed over PIA to another MD in March 1996, closing his tenure with great success and leaving PIA profitable with a profit for the previous six months of more than 55 million PKR. After his departure PIA started to nose dive. PIA purchased a Boeing 747 flight simulator to train its pilots. It also purchased another used Airbus A300 aircraft. A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 {{to cope with a}} surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well.|$|E
25|$|In his Fredericksburg headquarters, Lee was {{initially}} {{in the dark}} about the Union intentions and he suspected that the main column under Slocum was heading towards Gordonsville. Jeb Stuart's cavalry was cut off at first by Stoneman's departure on April 30, but they were soon able to move freely around the army's flanks on their reconnaissance missions after almost all their Union counterparts had left the area. As Stuart's intelligence information about the Union river crossings began to arrive, Lee did not react as Hooker had anticipated. He decided to violate one of the generally accepted principles of war and divide his force {{in the face of a}} superior enemy, hoping that aggressive action would allow him to attack and defeat a portion of Hooker's army before it could be fully concentrated against him. He became convinced that Sedgwick's force would demonstrate against him, but not become a serious threat, so he ordered about 4/5 of his army <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> from Chancellorsville. He left behind a brigade under Brig. Gen. William Barksdale on heavily fortified Marye's Heights behind Fredericksburg and one division under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, on Prospect Hill south of the town. These roughly 11,000 men and 56 guns would attempt to resist any advance by Sedgwick's 40,000. He ordered Stonewall Jackson to march west and link up with Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division, which had pulled back from the river crossings they were guarding and began digging earthworks on a north-south line between the Zoan and Tabernacle churches. McLaws's division was ordered from Fredericksburg to join Anderson. This would amass 40,000 men to confront Hooker's movement east from Chancellorsville. Fortunately for the Confederates, heavy fog along the Rappahannock masked some of these westward movements and Sedgwick chose to wait until he could determine the enemy's intentions.|$|E

500|$|The Foreign Office, meanwhile, was {{determined}} not to back down {{in the face of what}} was seen as a further affront to British prestige and a challenge. Thorneycroft argued that if the Victorious did not pass through the Straits on her return journey, Britain [...] "should suffer a substantial political defeat with unpredictable effects on our military position in the Far East," [...] and was supported in this view by Admiral Mountbatten and David Luce, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Mountbatten went even further, warning Thorneycroft that a failure <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> would have [...] "serious repercussions" [...] on Britain's [...] "whole military stature, not only in the Far East but worldwide." [...] Luce and Mountbatten also thought this the perfect opportunity to put pressure on Jakarta for the first time, Luce stating that the return passage [...] "might pass the initiative to us" [...] and Mountbatten seeing it as an opportune moment to divert Sukarno from his Malaysian raiding. At the very least, innocent passage through the Strait had to be defended.|$|E
500|$|To {{handle the}} {{logistics}} of the tests, Luis Alvarez was appointed by Robert Oppenheimer, {{the director of the}} Los Alamos laboratory, {{as the head of the}} RaLa program; his group was designated E-7, RaLa and Electric Detonators Group. [...] Bruno Rossi and Swiss physicist Hans Staub built the ionization chambers and electronics by late spring. At first the work proceeded at a leisurely pace as the implosion was only a backup project; it was believed that the plutonium bomb would be of the Thin Man gun-type nuclear weapon design. This turned out not to be the case, as the first tests on reactor-produced plutonium in early summer 1944 showed unacceptably high spontaneous fission rates due to the presence of plutonium-240, precluding the use of gun assembly. On 17 July the Thin Man design was abandoned, and all effort was focused on implosion. <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized—the X-Division (Explosive Division) and the G-Division (Gadget Division, or Weapon Physics Division) were formed.

500|$|Green's {{improvements}} {{came just}} in time <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779–83. Despite the siege, the defences were continually improved under Green's supervision. More batteries and bastions were constructed on the North Front, {{all the way up}} to the summit of the Rock. The first of Gibraltar's many tunnels was also constructed, with the original intention of reaching a rocky outcrop called the Notch on the north face of the Rock, to cover a blind angle on the Mediterranean side. As the tunnel was being constructed, an air vent was excavated using explosives. The tunnellers realised that they could use the shaft as an embrasure for a gun. They turned the tunnel into the first of a series of galleries with embrasures at intervals, overlooking the isthmus, which could be used to bombard the enemy lines with impunity. The tunnelling continued after the siege and by 1790 over [...] of tunnels had been excavated, providing bombproof communications routes between the various lines and batteries on the North Front of the Rock. The Notch was also reached and was hollowed out to become a large gallery, called St George's Hall, capable of accommodating five guns.|$|E
500|$|British {{timing was}} good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first {{artificial}} satellite, on 4 October 1957, {{came as a}} tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action {{in response to the}} Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge.</b> To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed. British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958. The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July, and was approved by Congress on 30 July. Macmillan called this [...] "the Great Prize".|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{introduces}} Career mode Challenges, {{that are}} either tied to specific songs, or allow players to select a song <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> requirement in [...] "open gigs".

Each Challenge features three possible completion levels—Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, mimicking the music recording sales certification levels—with Diamond being the most difficult to complete. The song-specific challenges include both instrument-specific challenges, such as correctly vocalizing the repeated [...] "Fame" [...] lyric at the end of David Bowie's [...] "Fame" [...] as it moves down in pitch, and more general scoring or performance challenges on either specific instruments or for the whole band. Open gig Challenges are presented by sponsors within the game, and are based on performance aspects such as scoring a certain amount of points using Star Power or using the guitar controller's whammy bar continuously for a length of time. These allow the player to select any song to complete, with some songs potentially being better suited for completing that challenge. The progress towards these Challenges is shown in-game by a record meter that appears when the challenge is active, and fills up similarly to the overall scoring meter as the player successfully completes towards the challenge.
