At the same time, the Poles invaded Moldavia and restored Ieremia Movilă to the throne; then they entered Wallachia, where Simion Movilă defeated Michael the Brave at Buzău. In <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> crisis, Michael the Brave left for Prague {{to appeal to the}} emperor for support. He returned to Transylvania in July 1601 at the head of an imperial army.

5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E

25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use you without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E
25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} {{the formation of}} the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan understands <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of this {{information}} Scipio elaborated his plan for the battle. He knew that the Carthaginian preparations to attack Castra Cornelia were continuing, and with the first signs of the spring he launched a preemptive strike. The ancient authors provide two versions of what happened. According to Livy and Polybius, Scipio placed a detachment (2,000 strong) on a hill overlooking Utica so as to deceive the enemy’s scouts that he was preparing to attack the city. Another small detachment was left to guard the Roman camp against possible attack from the city’s defenders. The main forces marched at night, more than 10 kilometers, and reached the camps of Hasdrubal and Syphax before dawn. Scipio separated the army in two halves and ordered Laelius and Massinissa’s Numidians to set fire and destroy the camp of Syphax. Laelius and Massinissa left almost no chances for escape of Syphax’s warriors, who were caught sleeping and utterly unprepared. The flames that started from the huts outside the palisades spread easily and engulfed the whole camp. All the exits were blockaded by the Romans, and numbers of unarmed soldiers were slaughtered; others were caught by the flames, as well as many pack animals, or trampled themselves to death at the gates. The same happened with the army of Hasdrubal. Its soldiers were awakened by the news that the neighbouring camp was ignited, and some of them rushed to help the Numidians without arms, thinking that the flames were result of an accident. Scipio waited for <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> confusion to attack with his part of the Roman army. The Carthaginians could not offer any organized resistance and were crushed. Only their general (as well as Syphax), with a small body of troops, managed to escape.|$|E

Roger and Jane go to the party, which is hosted by Jane's therapist and her husband. After dinner, Roger asks Jane if they can leave, but Jane reminds Roger that he agreed to take LSD with the group and begs him to stay, as she doesn't want to go through the experience alone. Roger is initially unimpressed with the drug but comes around after his consciousness begins to change with vivid audio-visual hallucinations. Roger and Jane return home via taxi and take a bath together, during which Roger imagines he is watching the 1919 World Series from the bathtub. The couple then talks candidly about their marriage for the first time. During <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> awareness, Jane admits that she knows the marriage is over.

500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E

2500|$|By {{looking to}} see when tones started {{preventing}} actions, the researchers supposedly know {{the length of time}} (in seconds) that exists between when a subject holds a conscious intention to move and performs the action of movement. <b>This</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> awareness (as seen in the graph below) is dubbed [...] "T" [...] (the mean time of conscious intention to move). It can be found by looking at the border between tones and no tones. This enables the researchers to estimate the timing of the conscious intention to move without relying on the subject's knowledge or demanding them to focus on a clock. The last step of the experiment is to compare time T for each subject with their Event-related potential (ERP) measures (e.g. seen in this page's lead image), which reveal when their finger movement genesis first begins.|$|E
