5|$|The Algo Centre Mall (legally Eastwood Mall since 2005 {{but almost}} never {{referred}} to as such) was a mall and hotel located {{in the middle of}} Elliot Lake, Ontario's commercial district on Highway 108. It was the largest commercial complex in the area. When the community was hit by uranium mine closures in the 1990s, the complex gradually refocused, hosting multiple services, such as a library, constituency offices, and public health offices. In recent years, many businesses located in the mall either closed or moved to outside locations. Still, the mall was a community hub, with most of the area's clothing stores and its largest grocery store, employing upwards of 250 local residents. It accounted for 10% of community's retail space and 6% of the <b>total</b> <b>wages.</b>|$|E

The first two weeks of 1912, Labor tried to learn how the owners of the mills would deal with the new law.

2500|$|Estimates vary {{about the}} number and quality of {{financial}} jobs in the city. One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200,000 persons in 2008. Another estimate was that in 2007, the financial services industry which had a $70 billion profit became 22 percent of the city's revenue. Another estimate (in 2006) was that the financial services industry makes up 9% of the city's work force and 31% of the tax base. An additional estimate (2007) from Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute was that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of its wages, and he estimated there were 175,000 securities-industries jobs in New York (both Wall Street area and midtown) paying an average of $350,000 annually. Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew {{at an annual rate}} of about 6.6% annually, a respectable rate, but that other financial centers were growing faster.

30|$|The {{variables}} {{for the analysis}} are constructed as follows. A plant’s revenue is its value of shipments deflated to 1987 dollars using 4 -digit SIC level industry price deflators from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database based on the 1987 SIC code definitions. 7 The deflated value added is also calculated as an alternative measure of revenue, which {{is used in the}} model’s estimation. Employment is a plant’s total number of workers engaged in production and non-production activities. The main <b>wage</b> variable, the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill, is deflated to 1987 dollars using CPI from Bureau of Labor Statistics. Using a plant’s deflated revenue, its deflated wage bill, and its employment, three ratios were constructed for each plant-CM wave observation: (a) the average wage – the ratio of the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill to employment, (b) labor productivity – the ratio of revenue to employment, and (c) the ratio of the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill to revenue, equivalent to the ratio of (a) to (b). The empirical analysis describes the life-cycle evolutions of these three ratios.|$|R

30|$|The average {{share of}} non-base wage {{components}} in the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill in 2013 was around 7 % when calculated by averaging over all the firms sampled and 9.5 % when calculated only across companies that pay non-base wages. Underlying this average, there is large cross-country heterogeneity. While the share of non-base wage {{components in the}} total bill in 2013 is 25 % on average in Portugal, it is about 4 % in Luxembourg and Ireland. When compared with the pre-crisis period, the average share of non-base wage components in the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill of the firms sampled in 2007 was 11.3 %, falling to 7.4 % in 2013 for the subset of countries that participated in the WDN 1 survey and 6.9 % for the 25 WDN 3 countries 6 (see Additional file  1 : Table S 1). The smaller fraction of non-base wage components in the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> bill in 2013 may reflect the slower economic growth in 2013 relative to the pre-crisis period (2002 – 2007), {{but it is also}} suggestive of an increased role of non-base wage cuts as a means of adjusting the wage bill during the crisis, in line with the higher share of companies paying bonuses and other performance-related benefits in 2013 (75 %) compared to 2007 (72 %).|$|R
40|$|Using Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS) {{data for}} the month of January from 2006 to 2016, by two-year intervals, this paper investigates gender-wage {{differentials}} by marital status in Canada. Utilizing a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique, this paper finds that the "unexplained" component of the wage gap, interpreted by some as a measure of discrimination, is positive in all the years in the study for married and single females. Examining primary differences between marital groups, I explore how gender-wage discrimination affects married women relative to single women. The results indicate that married females face higher <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> gaps and greater discrimination than their single counterparts. However, upon closer inspection of the proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> gap that is attributed to discrimination within each marital group, we find that proportion to be higher for single females. Therefore, taking the proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> gap as a measure, we find that married females face less discrimination than single females. It {{is important to note that}} conclusions drawn from the analysis are contingent upon the definition of “discrimination”, as it is apparent that referring to discrimination as the “unexplained” component of the wage gap as opposed to the proportion of the wage gap that is “unexplained” yields conflicting results...|$|R
