5|$|In Action Comics #14 (January 2013), {{which was}} {{published}} 7 November 2012, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus, 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked the star in Corvus, and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{cited as}} {{authoritative}} National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Oil & Gas Co., 91 F.2d 509 (5 Cir. 1937). If Mackay Radio {{had refused to}} rehire the workers because of anti-union animus, then <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unfair labor practice, the court held. Reviewing briefly the evidence generated by the Board during the hearings, Justice Roberts concluded that anti-union animus had motivated the employer and thus reinstatement was proper.|$|E

25|$|The protests {{would lead}} to an {{uprising}} and civil war, {{as part of the}} wider Arab Spring, which had already resulted in the ousting of long-term presidents of adjacent Tunisia and Egypt. Social media {{played a central role in}} organizing the opposition. A social media website declared an alternative government, one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> interim national council, was the first to compete with Muammar Gaddafi’s political authority. Gaddafi’s senior advisor attempted to reject the idea by tweeting his resignation.|$|E
25|$|The {{trenches}} were hot, dusty, and miserable, but {{conditions were}} worse between the lines, {{where thousands of}} wounded Federal soldiers suffered horribly without food, water, or medical assistance. Grant was reluctant {{to ask for a}} formal truce that would allow him to recover his wounded because <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> acknowledgment he had lost the battle. He and Lee traded notes across the lines from June 5 to 7 without coming to an agreement, and when Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities, {{it was too late for}} most of the unfortunate wounded, who were now bloated corpses. Grant was widely criticized in the Northern press for this lapse of judgment.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{conversion}} of nonexempt assets into exempt assets {{on the eve}} of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a {{conversion of}} nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.|$|E

500|$|Some {{people believe}} that only {{individuals}} suffering from cancer or AIDS can receive hospice care. Hospice in the United States developed around the model of cancer care, with a relatively predictable pattern of deterioration. According to 2002's The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End-of-life Care, [...] "60% of hospice patients have cancer." [...] But, patients can be on hospice for numerous other illnesses, such as end-stage heart and lung diseases, stroke, renal failure, Alzheimers, or many other conditions. Any diagnosis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> acceptable cause of death on a death certificate is, if expected to be terminal, an acceptable diagnosis for hospice care.|$|E
500|$|Naming {{the train}} was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd. [...] He wanted a name that started with the letter Z because this train was {{intended}} to be the [...] "last word" [...] in passenger service; Budd and his coworkers looked up the last words in their dictionaries, but neither zymurgy nor zyzzle conveyed the meanings that Budd was looking for. [...] The name of the new train came from The Canterbury Tales, which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—Zephyr.|$|E
500|$|When {{planning}} the development, Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery, {{as well as}} providing spectators with good sightlines in an atmospheric arena. Arup Associates designed the stadium to be [...] "an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club" [...] with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres. The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and openable louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to high-tech architecture.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him {{out to be a}} jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly [...] "isn’t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could fire them for winning the basketball game. But <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isn’t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episode’s original cut ran too long to air, and it’s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E
500|$|The single, [...] "Say I", is an {{inspirational}} and motivational record; Milian {{wanted to make}} a record <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> inspiration to both her and her fans. Focusing on an urban audience, Milian said the record was [...] "way more an urban record than anything I've ever done." [...] The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets, and thought his rap was [...] "a very real message. It pertained to his life." [...] The track, [...] "Twisted", {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the album. Lyrically, the song is about liking someone so much that you [...] "can't even go about [...] day in a normal way". Milian compared the urban vibe of both tracks and said they were huge records, [...] "where the music is just big and the hook is just big and you can’t help but sing [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{controversy}} surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, Mrs. Puff's name began to be criticized for supposedly referring to the slang term [...] "puff," [...] a descriptor of gay men that can be derogatory or affectionate. The BBC first noted this in reports of {{the controversy}} in 2002 and again in 2004. In a 2005 issue of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, columnist David Grimes challenged this interpretation, writing, [...] "I do not consider [...] damaging evidence. However, if SpongeBob were receiving lessons from Mr. Puff, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> entirely different matter." [...] K. Sobschak of the St. Catharines Standard also denounced the debate, asking, [...] "What is wrong with taking boating lessons from a fish? This is a comedy for kids." [...] The National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality revived the criticism of Mrs. Puff's name in 2012, citing {{it as one of}} the reasons for an attempted nationwide ban of the program. Mediaite Editor-in-Chief Andrew Kirell questioned this decision, asking rhetorically, [...] "What's so offensive there? Well, 'puff' is a term often used to describe a gay man, as if Ukrainian children knew that." ...|$|E

But I {{would like them}} to watch the best among the lotNool Veli, Mullum Malarum, Udiripookal, Salangai Oli and Amirthavarshini (Kannada)". In 2006, {{director}} S. Shankar said that he entered the film industry [...] "with dreams of directing films such as Mullum Malarum", though he never got to make such films. Asked for her favourite scene in any film, actress Sripriya replied: [...] "For me, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> entire movie– Mullum Malarum." [...] In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar asked eight Tamil directors to list ten of their favourite films; fourK. Balachander, K. Bhagyaraj, Mani Ratnam and K. S. Ravikumarnamed Mullum Malarum. Director Kathir said in July 2012 that Mullum Malarum inspired him to enter the film industry. The title of G. V. Prakash Kumar's film, Ketta Paiyan Da Indha Karthi, is a play on the line [...] "Ketta Paiyan Sir Indha Kaali" [...] from Mullum Malarum. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith stated that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a [...] "lesson" [...] of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} in this country of a {{separation}} of church and state, and the exemption of religious property from taxes.
