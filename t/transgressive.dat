5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the <b>transgressive</b> Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a <b>transgressive</b> phase.|$|E
5|$|Following Nine Inch Nails' success, Marilyn Manson, {{led by a}} protégé of Reznor's, came to prominence. The group's live {{performance}} and its <b>transgressive</b> appeal was often more commented on than their music.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Ohio the Hamilton Group also lies disconformably {{beneath the}} Rhinestreet Shale Member of the West Falls Formation, another <b>transgressive</b> black shale tongue with similar {{characteristics}} to the Marcellus.|$|E
5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document <b>transgressive</b> episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the <b>transgressive</b> strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{states that}} Tantrism is a contested concept. Tantra yoga may be described, {{according}} to Samuel, as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu (Saiva, Shakti) texts, which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using geometrical arrays and drawings (mandala), fierce male and particularly female deities, <b>transgressive</b> life stage related rituals, {{extensive use of}} chakras and mantras, and sexual techniques, all aimed to help one's health, long life and liberation.|$|E
5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups. Shirokogoroff, for instance, considered eighteenth-century Qing shamanism too formalized to be authentic. Historians of northeast Asia have criticized Eliade's and Shirokogoroff's interpretations because they neglect the political roles of shamans and shamanism's relation with the state. Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially <b>transgressive</b> led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A <b>transgressive</b> phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
25|$|In the Glossolalia {{he states}} that shamanism is not a fixed belief-system. The Southwark Mysteries {{explicitly}} honour the poetic “Spirit” above “the letter of the law”, art over religion, “Liberty” as a spiritual state in which contrary energies find creative expression. His essay <b>Transgressive</b> Shamanism considers how the West has appropriated the practices of indigenous shamans, especially relating {{to the use of}} psychoactive sacraments. It charts the <b>transgressive</b> use of such substances by artists, suggesting alternative “lines of transmission” in art. His Shamanic Playhouse workshops explore other ways of effecting altered mind-states. He speaks of “repatterning reality” and of the associations of the number 23 with “revelation and transformation”.|$|E
25|$|Above the <b>transgressive</b> {{sequence}} are Late Cretaceous shales with tight, micritic carbonate, {{marking the}} top of the Mesozoic. These shales thicken into troughs, providing the field's sole source rock. The youngest fauna are Maastrichtian, with an apparent disconformity between the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene, marked by high levels of gamma radiation on logs.|$|E
25|$|Sarir C is {{contained}} in a structural-stratigraphic trap, represented by dips to the east, south, and west and the major northeast-southwest-trending fault on its northwest flank. In much of the central and northwest, the reservoir subcrops and is sealed by shales that unconformably overlie it. Minor sand accumulations in the <b>transgressive</b> series above the basal sands occur in updip, pinchout traps.|$|E
25|$|Sarir C's main trap is not full to {{the spill}} point, which is downplunge {{on the ridge}} west of the structure. The oil column has a maximum height of 91 m, with a 122 m {{vertical}} closure. Crude distribution in the trap is affected by lithological variation. Oil-water levels are common in the main reservoir members, but the <b>transgressive</b> series is 43 m higher.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the {{exhibition}} at the American Folk Art Museum, titled , examined the influence of Darger's oeuvre on 11 artists, including Trenton Doyle Hancock, Robyn O'Neil, and Amy Cutler, who were responding {{not only to the}} aesthetic nature of Darger's mythic work – with its tales of good versus evil, its epic scope and complexity, and its <b>transgressive</b> undertone – but also to his driven work ethic and all-consuming devotion to artmaking.|$|E
25|$|Remains of the {{cartilaginous}} fish Antarctilamna sp., the Placoderms Asterolepis sp. and {{two species}} of Bothriolepis, the spiny shark ?Cheiracanthoides sp., the Porolepiform Holoptychius sp., and the Rhizodontid ?Strepsodus sp. have been uncovered from the Cuche Formation. Several other fossils are less well recognizable at the genus level, among others Actinopterygii, Sarcopterygii, and Osteolepiformes. The fish specimens were found in sediments possibly representing localized <b>transgressive</b> marine incursions into brackish lagoonal settings, in all cases associated {{with the presence of}} bivalves, ostracods and brachiopods.|$|E
25|$|The Sarir stratigraphic column {{generally}} resembles succession patterns {{throughout the}} Sirte Basin, with some variations. In the early regressive phase, basal sandstones were deposited on a Precambrian basement of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sandstones are dated on angiosperm pollen as younger than Albian, probably from the Late Cretaceous. After a lengthy hiatus, represented by unconformity and sandstone erosion, a <b>transgressive</b> sequence of red, green, and purple Anhydrite shales was laid. Variegated bed remnants occur in crestal sections of many northern structures, {{such as in}} wells B-1-65 and C-1-80.|$|E
25|$|The geology and {{geomorphology}} of {{the area}} is characterised by an island of outcropping bedrock on the eastern headland and joined to other bedrock outcrops on its western end by a sand spit which forms {{the main part of}} the headland. The Peninsula still has quite a view overlapping <b>transgressive</b> barrier dunes and it is believed that they have shifted north from Bate Bay. Older stable parabolic dunes occur on a series of north to south oriented ridges and while most of the vegetation has been cleared, some dry sclerophyll woodland remains.|$|E
25|$|It is {{suggested}} that this newfound power resulting from women's taking revolutionary action, led {{to the death of}} some powerful women of this era, including Marie Antoinette, Olympe de Gouges, and Madame Roland. Corday's killing of such an influential leader during the revolution angered many people. Her actions were described by many as disquieting as well as <b>transgressive.</b> This behavior left a lasting impression on male revolutionaries because even though women were not at the forefront, they nonetheless had a place in the revolution, but not a prominent enough one to counteract a woman committing such an act.|$|E
25|$|Homerton is {{also home}} to Chats Palace arts centre, named after the nearby Chatsworth Road. Chats Palace has {{presented}} and encouraged a wide variety of music, comedy, theatre, photography, carnival, disability arts, dance and <b>transgressive</b> performance, including Clifford Jarvis, Tom Hunter, Miniscule of Sound, Red Saunders, Asian Dub Foundation and Graeae Theatre Company. It also hosts an array of classes for all abilities and age ranges, and has been an accessible and affordable space for local people to celebrate their important occasions or present their projects. The building itself was originally established as a Carnegie library for the betterment {{of the people of the}} East End. The council closed the library in 1977 but the building was reclaimed by members of the local community.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Adult Swim has {{frequently}} aired adult animation features, anime, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, live-action, and pilots. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence; in other words, programs {{that would be}} deemed inappropriate if aired during the day on Cartoon Network, when children would be watching. While the network features comedic and dramatic programs of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, <b>transgressive,</b> improvised, and surrealist in nature. Thus, Adult Swim has {{become a source of}} conflict, with some saying that it is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, made the midnight movie a significant new mode of cinematic exhibition, with <b>transgressive</b> connotations. Socializing in a countercultural milieu was part of the original attraction of the midnight filmgoing experience, something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new midnight movie circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century-Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B-picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chapters}} {{begin with}} brief re-tellings of creation myths that emerged as attempts {{to explain the}} origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Ancient Egyptian, Australian Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary alien-abduction mythology; Chapter 4 ("What are things made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical magnification equipment, any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits his childhood and recalls his initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by his young contemporaries. Dawkins gives his critique {{of many of the}} myths, such as when he points out that much mythology involves some god's symbolic <b>transgressive</b> act performed just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.|$|E
500|$|Academics {{have written}} of how <b>transgressive</b> themes in cult films can be regressive. [...] David Church and Chuck Kleinhans {{describe}} an uncritical celebration of <b>transgressive</b> themes in cult films, including misogyny and racism. [...] Church has also criticized gendered descriptions of <b>transgressive</b> content that celebrate masculinity. [...] Joanne Hollows further identifies a gendered component to {{the celebration of}} <b>transgressive</b> themes in cult films, where male terms are used to describe films outside the mainstream while female terms are used to describe mainstream, conformist cinema. [...] Jacinda Read's expansion states that cult films, despite their potential for empowerment of the marginalized, are more often used by politically incorrect males. [...] Knowledgeable about feminism and multiculturalism, they seek a refuge from the academic acceptance of these progressive ideals. [...] Their playful and ironic acceptance of regressive lad culture invites, and even dares, condemnation from academics and the uncool. [...] Thus, cult films become a tool to reinforce mainstream values through <b>transgressive</b> content; Rebecca Feasy states that cultural hierarchies can also be reaffirmed through mockery of films perceived to be lacking masculinity. [...] However, the sexploitation films of Doris Wishman took a feminist approach which avoids and subverts the male gaze and traditional goal-oriented methods. [...] Wishman's subject matter, though exploitative and <b>transgressive,</b> was always framed in terms of female empowerment and the feminine spectator. [...] Her use of common cult film motifs – female nudity and ambiguous gender – were repurposed to comment on feminist topics. [...] Similarly, the films of Russ Meyer were a complicated combination of <b>transgressive,</b> mainstream, progressive, and regressive elements. [...] They attracted both acclaim and denouncement from critics and progressives. [...] <b>Transgressive</b> films imported from cultures that are recognizably different yet still relatable {{can be used to}} progressively examine issues in another culture.|$|E

500|$|<b>Transgressive</b> {{films as}} a {{distinct}} artistic movement began in the 1970s. [...] Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of European art cinema and experimental film, the gritty subject matter of Italian neorealism, and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation. [...] Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time. [...] In the 1980s, filmmaker Nick Zedd identified this movement as the Cinema of Transgression and later wrote a manifesto. [...] Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as [...] "downtown culture". [...] These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as The Village Voice. [...] Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film. [...] Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters <b>transgressive</b> motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film. [...] Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as Battle Royale (2000), which broke many rules of teenage slasher films. [...] The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their <b>transgressive</b> edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans. [...] Audience participation itself can be <b>transgressive,</b> such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.|$|E
500|$|Despite their oppositional nature, cult films {{can produce}} celebrities. [...] Like cult films themselves, {{authenticity}} {{is an important}} aspect of their popularity. [...] Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles. Tim Curry, despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. [...] Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it. Mary Woronov, known for her <b>transgressive</b> roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films. She was expected to recreate the <b>transgressive</b> elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema. [...] Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her Andy Warhol films, she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman. Sylvia Kristel, after starring in Emmanuelle (1974), found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s. [...] Caught between the <b>transgressive</b> elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and Emmanuelle sequels. [...] Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned. [...] Similarly, Chloë Sevigny has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in <b>transgressive</b> films. [...] Cult films can also trap directors. Leonard Kastle, who directed The Honeymoon Killers (1969), never directed another film again. [...] Despite his cult following, which included François Truffaut, he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays. [...] Qualities that bring cult films to prominence – such as an uncompromising, unorthodox vision – caused Alejandro Jodorowsky to languish in obscurity for years.|$|E
500|$|... incest is {{sanctioned by}} {{reproductive}} necessity; because it lacks consequences, {{this story is}} not a socially recognized narrative paradigm for incest. [...] In the cases of both Lot's daughters and Myrrha, the daughter's seduction of the father has to be covert. While other incest configurations - mother-son, sibling - permit consensual agency, father-daughter incest does not; when the daughter displays <b>transgressive</b> sexual desire, the prohibitive father appears.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Cineaste asked a {{range of}} {{academics}} for their definition of a cult film. [...] Several people defined cult films primarily {{in terms of their}} opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a <b>transgressive</b> element, though others disputed the <b>transgressive</b> potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films. [...] Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with <b>transgressive</b> elements. [...] Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior. [...] Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria. [...] Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in structuration, where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized. Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while Jonathan Rosenbaum rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. [...] Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. [...] That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident. [...] This ambiguity leads critics of postmodernism to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or metanarratives. [...] These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.|$|E

500|$|Cult {{films are}} often {{approached}} {{in terms of}} auteur theory, which states that the director's creative vision drives a film. [...] This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics. [...] Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult. [...] According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism. [...] Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship. [...] By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans. [...] Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream. [...] Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs. [...] This may {{take the place of}} – and even ignore – political readings of the director. [...] Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their <b>transgressive</b> content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture. [...] While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation. [...] Someone like George Romero, whose films are both <b>transgressive</b> and subversive, will have the <b>transgressive</b> aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} journal, Julianne Pidduck {{commented on the}} film's rape and murder scenes, [...] "Effectively, the viewer is asked to {{experience}} the rape from the victim's point of view. The film invites political, emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk, especially for female and/or queer viewers. An allegiance with Brandon's outsider status aligns the viewer with Brandon's initial exhilaration at his <b>transgressive</b> success as a boy, drawing us through to the film's disturbing finale." ...|$|E

500|$|The British Film Institute see Kind Hearts and Coronets as [...] "less sentimental" [...] {{than many}} of the other Ealing films. Along with The Man in the White Suit (1951) and The Ladykillers (1955), Kind Hearts and Coronets [...] "unleash <b>transgressive</b> nightmares, fables of subversive, {{maverick}} masculine obsession and action, where the repressed and vengeful bubble up to the surface and lead to a resolutions which were only just contained in the moral strictures permissable in (Balcon's) Ealing cinema at the time".|$|E
500|$|Industrial {{music is}} a genre of {{experimental}} and electronic music that draws on <b>transgressive</b> or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by members of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album The Second Annual Report, they coined the slogan [...] "industrial music for industrial people". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the [...] "most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music"; [...] "initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation".|$|E
500|$|Democrat and Chronicle raved, “Flashy, {{funny and}} uplifting, Kinky Boots has appeal — {{and lots of}} it — for all ‘ladies, gentleman {{and those who are}} yet to make up their mind.’” BroadwayWorld Los Angeles offered “praise to the entire triple threat ensemble!“ The Republic countered, “Despite the fiery showstopper [...] "Sex Is in the Heel," [...] however, [...] "Kinky Boots" [...] is {{surprisingly}} short on sex appeal, and the cheerleaderish troupe of drag queens called Angels don't have any of the <b>transgressive</b> appeal of the Cagelles from Fierstein's earlier hit [...] "La Cage aux Folles."

500|$|The {{site of the}} brothel at 19 Cleveland Street, Marylebone, and its {{historical}} context within the homosexual and other <b>transgressive</b> communities of London's Fitzrovia and neighbouring Soho and Bloomsbury, has become the subject of academic study and general interest. In Parliament, Labouchère indignantly described 19 Cleveland Street as [...] "in no obscure thoroughfare, but nearly opposite the Middlesex Hospital". The house, which was located {{on the western side}} of Cleveland Street, no longer survives: it was demolished in the 1890s for an extension of the Hospital, which itself was bulldozed in 2005. Two sketches of the house were published by The Illustrated Police News.|$|E
500|$|Another {{controversial}} issue was the gender bending element. Perkins, who was allegedly a homosexual, and Hitchcock, who previously made the LGBT film Rope, were both {{experienced in the}} film's <b>transgressive</b> subject matter. The viewer is unaware of the gender dysphoria until {{at the end of}} the movie. It is revealed that Bates is a crossdresser in the attempted murder of Sam. At the station, Sam asks why was Bates dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates' split personality, bluntly utters that Bates is a transvestite. The psychiatrist corrects him and says, [...] "Not exactly." [...] He explains that Bates believes that he is his own mother when he dresses in her clothes.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial {{music videos}} {{reflected}} her American and Hispanic mixed street style {{combined with a}} flamboyant glamor. She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era. Author Douglas Kellner noted, [...] "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally <b>transgressive</b> moves {{turned out to be}} highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences." [...] Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of [...] "La Isla Bonita".|$|E
