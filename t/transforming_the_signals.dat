40|$|Long term {{behavior}} of nonlinear deterministic continuous time signals {{can be studied}} {{in terms of their}} reconstructed attractors. Reconstructed attractors of a continuous signal are meant to be topologically equivalent representations of the dynamics of the unknown dynamical system which generates the signal. Sometimes, geometry of the attractor or its complexity may give important information on the system of interest. However, if the trajectories of the attractor behave as if they are not coming from continuous system or there exists many spike like structures on the path of the system trajectories, then {{there is no way to}} characterize the shape of the attractor. In this article, the traditional attractor reconstruction method is first used for two types of ECG signals: Normal healthy persons (NHP) and Congestive Heart failure patients (CHFP). As common in such a framework, the reconstructed attractors are not at all well formed and hence it is not possible to adequately characterize their geometrical features. Thus, we incorporate frequency domain information to the given time signals. This is done by <b>transforming</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> to a time frequency domain by means of suitable Wavelet transforms (WT). The transformed signal concerns two non homogeneous variables and is still quite difficult to use to reconstruct some dynamics out of it. By applying a suitable mapping, this signal is further converted into integer domain and a new type of 3 D plot, called integer lag plot, which characterizes and distinguishes the ECG signals of NHP and CHFP, is finally obtained.

40|$|System {{identification}} finds nowadays {{application in}} various areas of biological research {{as a tool}} of empiric mathematical modeling and model individualization. A fundamental challenge of system identification in biology awaits in the form of response variability. Furthermore, biological systems tend to exhibit high degree of nonlinearity as well as significant time delays. This thesis covers system identification approaches developed for the applications within two particular biomedical fields: neuroscience and endocrinology. The first topic of the thesis is parameter estimation of the classical Elementary Motion Detector (EMD) model in insect vision. There are two important aspects {{to be taken care of}} in the identification approach, namely the nonlinear dynamics of the individual EMD and the spatially distributed structure of multiple detectors producing a measurable neural response. Hence, the suggested identification method is comprised of two consecutive stages addressing each of the above aspects. Furthermore, visual stimulus design for high spatial excitation order has been investigated. The second topic is parameter estimation of mathematical model for testosterone regulation in the human male. The main challenges of this application are in the unavailability of input signal measurements and the presence of an unknown pulsatile feedback in the system resulting in a highly nonlinear closed-loop dynamics. Semi-blind identification method has been developed based on a recently proposed pulse-modulated model of pulsatile endocrine regulation. The two system identification problems treated in the thesis bear some resemblance in the sense that both involve measured signals that can be seen as square-integrable functions of time. This property is handled by <b>transforming</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> into the Laguerre domain, i. e. by equivalently representing the functions with their infinite Laguerre series...|$|E
40|$|In an {{exploratory}} approach to data analysis, {{it is often}} useful to consider the observations as generated from a set of latent generators or "sources" via a generally unknown mapping. For the noisy overcomplete case, where we have more sources than observations, the problem becomes extremely ill-posed. Solutions to such inverse problems can, in many cases, be achieved by incorporating prior knowledge about the problem, captured {{in the form of}} constraints. This setting is a natural candidate for the application of the Bayesian methodology, allowing us to incorporate "soft" constraints in a natural manner. The work described in this paper is mainly driven by problems in functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, for the neuro-scientific goal of extracting relevant "maps" from the data. This can be stated as a 'blind' source separation problem. Recent experiments in the field of neuroscience show that these maps are sparse, in some appropriate sense. The separation problem can be solved by independent component analysis (ICA), viewed as a technique for seeking sparse components, assuming appropriate distributions for the sources. We derive a hybrid wavelet-ICA model, <b>transforming</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> into a domain where the modeling assumption of sparsity of the coefficients with respect to a dictionary is natural. We follow a graphical modeling formalism, viewing ICA as a probabilistic generative model. We use hierarchical source and mixing models and apply Bayesian inference to the problem. This allows us to perform model selection in order to infer the complexity of the representation, as well as automatic denoising. Since exact inference and learning in such a model is intractable, we follow a variational Bayesian mean-field approach in the conjugate-exponential family of distributions, for efficient unsupervised learning in multi-dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on some representative experiments. Â© 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} century, {{physiological}} signals have been broadly analyzed and processed {{not only to}} assess {{the function of the}} human physiology, but also to better diagnose illnesses or injuries and provide treatment options for patients. In particular, Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP) and impedance are among the most important biomedical signals processed and analyzed. The majority of studies that utilize these signals attempt to diagnose important irregularities such as arrhythmia or blood loss by processing one of these signals. However, the relationship between them is not yet fully studied using computational methods. Therefore, a system that extract and combine features from all physiological signals representative of states such as arrhythmia and loss of blood volume to predict the presence and the severity of such complications is of paramount importance for care givers. This will not only enhance diagnostic methods, but also enable physicians to make more accurate decisions; thereby the overall quality of care provided to patients will improve significantly. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, analysis and processing of ECG signal to detect the most important waves i. e. P, QRS, and T, are described. A wavelet-based method is implemented to facilitate and enhance the detection process. The method not only provides high detection accuracy, but also efficient in regards to memory and execution time. In addition, the method is robust against noise and baseline drift, as supported by the results. The second part outlines a method that extract features from ECG signal in order to classify and predict the severity of arrhythmia. Arrhythmia can be life-threatening or benign. Several methods exist to detect abnormal heartbeats. However, a clear criterion to identify whether the detected arrhythmia is malignant or benign still an open problem. The method discussed in this dissertation will address a novel solution to this important issue. In the third part, a classification model that predicts the severity of loss of blood volume by incorporating multiple physiological signals is elaborated. The features are extracted in time and frequency domains after <b>transforming</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> with Wavelet Transformation (WT).

40|$|Introduction The {{diagnosis}} of agricultural machinery faults must be performed at an opportune time, {{in order to}} fulfill the agricultural operations in a timely manner and to optimize the accuracy and the integrity of a system, proper monitoring and fault {{diagnosis of}} the rotating parts is required. With development of fault diagnosis methods of rotating equipment, especially bearing failure, the security, performance and availability of machines has been increasing. In general, fault detection is conducted through a specific procedure which starts with data acquisition and continues with features extraction, and subsequently failure of the machine would be detected. Several practical methods have been introduced for fault detection in rotating parts of machineries. The review of the literature shows that both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used for this purpose. However, the results show that SVM is more effective than Artificial Neural Networks in fault detection of such machineries. In some smart detection systems, incorporating an optimized method such as Genetic Algorithm in the Neural Network model, could improve the fault detection procedure. Consequently, the fault detection performance of neural networks may also be improved by combining with the Genetic Algorithm and hence will be comparable with the performance of the Support Vector Machine. In this study, the so called Genetic Algorithm (GA) method was used to optimize the structure of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for fault detection of the clutch retainer mechanism of Massey Ferguson 285 tractor. Materials and Methods The test rig consists of some electro mechanical parts including the clutch retainer mechanism of Massey Ferguson 285 tractor, a supporting shaft, a single-phase electric motor, a loading mechanism to model the load of the tractor clutch and the corresponding power train gears. The data acquisition section consists of a data analyzer (PCA- 40), a personal computer, a piezoelectric accelerometer (VMI- 102, DT- 2234 B), a tachometer and two rubber vibration absorbing elements are located between the rigâ€™s components and the plate holder. An evaluation function was employed in order to achieve the optimal structure of neural network models by selecting the number of layers, number of cells in the layers, transfer function, training function, learning functions, performance function, and number of epochs, {{in such a way that}} the MSE of the calculated output error was minimal. The data were collected by means of the accelerometer sensor attached on the clutch mechanism, with three different working conditions (normal condition, with worn bearing, and with worn shaft), and three rotational speeds including: 1000 rpm, 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. The Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) was applied on the data-set for features vector extraction and the principle component analyses (PCA) was applied for dimension reduction of the features vector. The signal processing and the features extraction are the most important characteristics of the monitoring methodology, by which the working condition of the machine can be determined. These characteristics may be acquired by <b>transforming</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> from the time domain to the frequency domain and MATLAB software is used for this purpose. This software receives the vibration data (time series of output voltage) which are in Excel files format. To remove the noise a suitable filtering procedure was used and finally the statistical parameters of time - frequency were calculated. Results and Discussion To verify the accuracy of the Genetic Algorithm model, the required data were collected from the training and testing steps of the Neural Network. For this purpose, the statistical parameters such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (r) were used. The optimal parameters of the neural network obtained for the family of Db 4. A trial and error procedure was used to minimize the mean square error of the network output and the desired amount of training step. During the training step, four neural networks including Db 4, Db 30, Db 35 and Db 40 achieved a gradient descent weight in the learning bias and four neural networks including Db 9, Db 15, Db 20 and Db 25 achieved a gradient descent with momentum weight in the learning bias. The two of the achieved neural networks including Db 4, Db 20 have circular logarithm function and the remaining networks have annular hyperbolic tangent transfer function. The most appropriate networks configuration was acquired when the network exhibited the minimal error with the training and testing data sets. The results show that the highest accuracy of the GA-ANN Artificial neural networks for all rotational speeds (1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm), and working conditions (intact gear and shaft, damaged bearing and worn shaft) observed for the network family of Db 4. The highest error observed for the family of Db 20 with MSE of 0. 011. Conclusions Artificial neural networks can somewhat think and make decisions similar to an expert person. In this project in order to predict the occurrence of a failure of the clutch mechanism of MF 285 tractor, the experimental data were obtained using some sensors, and the data were transferred to a computer by means of a data analytical. By training of the neural networks, the errors were identified separately. The output data from the combined Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm shows that the performance of the prediction model is enhanced. Based on the experiments and calculations, the best data set belongs to the family of Db 4 network with the least MSE equal to 4. 09 E- 07 and r equal to 0. 99999, indicating that the model could precisely detect the faulty bearings or shafts...|$|E
