5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> at least two solar eclipses, and there can {{be as many as}} five.|$|E

In the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that at all times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft.

25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> a distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E

25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases {{the total number of}} possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3Ã1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9Ã1022).|$|E
25|$|The hairy ball theorem of {{algebraic}} topology (sometimes called the hedgehog theorem in Europe) states {{that there is}} no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres.

In other words, whenever one attempts to comb a hairy ball flat, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> at least one tuft of hair at one point on the ball.

The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by recombination, as it is the case for the antigen receptors.|$|E

25|$|Some animals {{would be}} living in the trees, as animals are always taking {{advantage}} of all available niches, both for feeding and protection.

But <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> some species who will be able to cope with that by following their food source up the trees.

25|$|It is from Platoâs {{caution that}} {{in the modern era}} many are aware of {{political}} and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In motion picture rating systems, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also societyâs attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on {{a life of their own}} once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.|$|E
40|$|Collaboration {{has become}} a hot topic {{in the field of}} {{language}} documentation, with many authors insisting that lone wolf research is unethical research. We take issue with the viewpoints that documentary linguists must collaborate with the community, that the linguistâs goals should be subordinate to the goals of community members, and that solo research is necessarily unethical research. Collaborating with community members in language documentation projects is not the only method of treating the community fairly and reciprocating their generosity. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> not <b>always</b> <b>be</b> community members interested in language documentation, nor <b>will</b> <b>there</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> community members capable of participation. Even in cases where community members are interested, capable, and willing, both the researcher and the community should be allowed to decide when, where, how, and whether to collaborate. Moreover, we suggest that the insistence on collaboration can cause guilt when collaboration is difficult, or can lead researchers into unproductive or even dangerous situations. On the other hand, we welcome collaboration if both parties retain autonomy in decision-making and both truly want to work collaboratively. There is nothing unethical about setting oneâs own research agenda and conducting linguistic fieldwork alone. Lone wolf linguistics isnât necessarily unethical linguistics.
