5|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{constitutionality}} of this restriction {{has not yet}} arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} judges, {{including}} Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves {{in favor of the}} amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments.

5|$|A second {{expedition}} {{was mounted}} shortly thereafter, and Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the Molonglo (Ngambri) and Queanbeyan (Jullergung) Rivers, {{becoming the first}} Europeans to camp at the site. However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821, when Charles Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period is <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of}} the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E

5|$|Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican {{nomination}} for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, {{ran on the}} previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected {{by a margin of}} 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Court did not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{poisoning}} {{incidents are}} unintentional and result from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> similarity of A.phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom, Volvariella volvacea, with East- and Southeast-Asian immigrants in Australia {{and the west}} coast of the United States falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants.

5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for crews' wages {{to be stopped}} when a ship was sunk. Famed Labour leader James Larkin raised <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors' treatment in the Dáil Éireann. Citing the crew member who {{was told by the}} Labour exchange to 'go and get his record card', which was lost when Irish Oak sank, he suggested that the Dáil Éireann ask the German Consul-General to send a submarine to retrieve it.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore {{the relationship between the}} anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E

The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles.

5|$|Swedish King John III and Stefan Batory allied against Ivan IV in December 1577, despite {{problems}} caused {{by the death of}} Sigimund which meant that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substantial inheritance due to John's wife, Catherine had not been resolved. Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia, without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{radius of}} the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics.

5|$|This Bull was {{confirmed}} by Pope Alexander's successor Pope Lucius III. Jocelin had obtained this confirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and early 1182. He had been sent there by King William, along with abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Kelso and the prior of Inchcolm, in order {{to appeal to the}} Pope regarding his stance in a struggle over the Bishopric of St Andrews and the sentence of excommunication and interdict the Pope had placed over the king and kingdom. The dispute concerned the election to the bishopric of John the Scot, which had been opposed by the king, who organised the election of his own candidate, Hugh. The mission was successful. The Pope lifted the interdict, absolved the king and appointed two legates to investigate <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> St Andrews succession. The Pope even sent the king a Golden Rose, an item usually given to the Prefect of Rome. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> succession, however, did not go away. In 1186, Jocelin, along with the abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Newbattle, excommunicated Hugh on the instructions of Pope Lucius. Hugh travelled to Rome in 1188, and obtained absolution, but he died of the pestilence in that city a few days later, thus allowing the issue to be resolved.|$|E
