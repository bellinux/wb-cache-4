5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|Ray tourism {{benefits}} {{locals and}} visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> animals. It {{can also provide}} funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission. At Bora Bora, an excessive number of swimmers, boaters and jet skiers caused the local manta ray population to abandon the area.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{looks into}} the {{situation}} and finds Ostelhoff's body; however, they believe it is {{the body of a}} suicidal Mulder. The next day Scully identifies Ostelhoff's body as Mulder and is met by assistant director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) who tells her that Section Chief Scott Blevins (Charles Cioffi) is looking for her. She meets with them, and tells <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> previous incidents leading to Mulder's apparent suicide. Meanwhile, Mulder has broken into the Department of Defense.|$|E

5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> success of their {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who {{appeared to have been}} the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E

5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip {{the washing machine}} but fail to do so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E
5|$|On June21, {{officials}} in China closed Xiamen port {{and stated that}} it would resume operations once the storm passed. Later that day 33,000 vessels sought refuge at port. Following the issuance of a land warning, government offices and schools were closed throughout the island. Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approaching storm. In Hong Kong, public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June20. Officials also evacuated roughly 160,000 people from coastal areas in Fujian. A total of 167 flights to and from Taiwan were canceled or delayed due to the storm.|$|E

5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within <b>them.</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
