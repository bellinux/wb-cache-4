5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90°, and dropped to <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> to force Styles' face into <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E

40|$|Antarctica; {{microbial}} mat; nitrogen assimilation; N 2 fixation; photosynthesis; photosynthetic pigments. The community {{structure and}} physiological characteristics of three microbial mat communities in Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) were compared. One of <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> was {{located at the}} edge of a stream and was dominated by diatoms (with a thin basal layer of oscillatorian cyanobac-teria), whereas <b>the</b> other two <b>mats,</b> located over moist soil and the bottom of a pond, respectively, were dominated by cyanobacteria throughout their vertical profiles. The predominant xanthophyll was fucoxanthin in <b>the</b> stream <b>mat</b> and myxoxanthophyll in <b>the</b> cyanobacteria-dominated <b>mats.</b> <b>The</b> sheath pigment scytonemin was absent in <b>the</b> stream <b>mat</b> but present in the soil and pond <b>mats.</b> <b>The</b> stream <b>mat</b> showed significantly lower d 13 C and higher d 15 N values than <b>the</b> other two <b>mats.</b> Consistent with <b>the</b> d 15 N values, N 2 fixation was negligible in <b>the</b> stream <b>mat.</b> <b>The</b> soil <b>mat</b> was <b>the</b> physiologically most active community. It showed rates of photosynthesis three times higher than in <b>the</b> other <b>mats,</b> and had <b>the</b> highest rates of ammonium uptake, nitrate uptake and N 2 fixation.

50|$|To prevent mats {{from being}} {{displaced}} by the explosion, they can be covered with layers of soil or anchored to the ground. Anchoring <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> is also essential when the blasting is done on an incline where <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> may slide down from the rock face.|$|R
40|$|The {{regenerated}} silk fibroin {{dissolved in}} formic acid was electrospun into nanofiber mats. Structural {{characteristics of the}} spun as received and methanol and ethanol treated fibers were examined using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Mechanical properties and air permeability of <b>the</b> electrospun <b>mats</b> were also studied. IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry showed random coil conformation and amorphous structure for as-spun fibers while typical FTIR spectra and X-ray diffractograms of β-sheet crystalline structure were recorded for the methanol and ethanol treated fibers. The mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> {{were found to be}} dependent on fiber diameter. <b>The</b> <b>mats</b> containing fibers with smaller diameter had higher tensile strength but lower breaking strain. Methanol and ethanol treatment enhanced tensile strengths of <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> at <b>the</b> expenses of their breaking strain. Air permeability and pore size of <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> are strongly associated with diameter of the electrospun fibers...|$|R
5|$|A tag team match pitting {{the team}} of Roxxi and Taylor Wilde against {{the team of}} Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed, who were {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan, was held.

5|$|Christian Cage fought Monty Brown next to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This bout lasted 12 minutes and 32 seconds. In the beginning the two fought at ringside, until Cage jumped {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle onto Brown with an aerial splash. After this, Cage removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles. Brown gained a two-count on Cage after slamming him against <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver and covered for the pin, but the referee had a delayed reaction. Later, Cage caused Brown to run into the exposed turnbuckle, he then followed by forcing Brown's face into <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> with his signature Unprettier maneuver. He then pinned Brown to become the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|Microfibrous {{materials}} with a targeted design based on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were prepared by electrospinning and by combining electrospinning and electrospraying. Several approaches were used: (i) electrospinning {{of a common}} solution of the two polymers, (ii) simultaneous electrospinning of two separate solutions of PLA and PCL, (iii) electrospinning of PLA solution in conjunction with electrospraying of PCL solution, and (iv) alternating layer-by-layer deposition by electrospinning of separate PLA and PCL solutions. <b>The</b> <b>mats</b> were heated at the melting temperature of PCL (60 °"), thus achieving melting of PCL fibers/particles and thermal sealing of <b>the</b> fibers. <b>The</b> <b>mats</b> subjected to thermal treatment were characterized by greater mean fiber diameters and reduced values of the water contact angle compared to <b>the</b> pristine <b>mats.</b> Heat treatment of <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> affected their thermal stability and led {{to an increase in}} the crystallinity degree of PLA incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>mats,</b> whereas that of PCL was reduced.

40|$|Microbial mats are modern {{examples}} of the earliest microbial communities known. Among the best studied are microbial mats growing in hypersaline ponds managed {{for the production of}} salt by Exportadora de Sal, S. A. de C. V., Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. In May, 2001, we collected mats from Ponds 4 and 5 in this system and returned them to Ames Research Center, where they have been maintained for a period of over nine months. We report here on both the ecophysiological changes occurring in <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> over that period of time as well as the facility in which they were incubated. Mats (approximately 1 sq. meter total area) were incubated in a greenhouse facility modified to provide <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> with natural levels of visible and ultraviolet radiation as well as constantly flowing, temperature-controlled water. Two replicated treatments were maintained, a 'high salinity' treatment (about 120 ppt) and a 'low salinity' treatment (about 90 ppt). Rates of net biological activity (e. g., photosynthesis, respiration, trace gas production) in <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> were relatively constant over the several months, and were similar to rates of activity measured in the field. However, over the course of <b>the</b> incubation, <b>mats</b> in both treatments changed in physical appearance. The most obvious change was that <b>mats</b> in <b>the</b> higher salinity treatments developed a higher proportion of carotenoid pigments (relative to chlorophyll), resulting in a noticeably orange color in <b>the</b> high salinity <b>mats.</b> This trend is also seen in the natural salinity gradient present at the field site. Changes in the community composition of <b>the</b> <b>mats,</b> as assayed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), as well as biomarker compounds produced in <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> were also monitored. The degree to which <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> kept in <b>the</b> greenhouse changed from <b>the</b> originally collected <b>mats,</b> as well as differences between high and low salinity mats will be discussed.
