5|$|In August 2014, Indonesian {{police and}} {{security}} forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of ISIS, citing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia. The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of CCTV monitors and {{the implementation of a}} night patrol in and around the temple compound. The jihadist group follows a strict interpretation of Islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 2006, Michael O'Leary, chief {{executive}} of Ryanair, claimed that the chaos at airports meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> were achieving their aims.|$|E
25|$|Harun Khan, the {{secretary}} general of the Muslim Council of Britain, also condemned the attack. More than 130 imams condemned the attackers, refused them Islamic burials, and said in a statement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> did not represent Islam.|$|E
25|$|In October, Tsvetanov {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> attack had {{a maximum of}} five accomplices, {{all of which were}} foreign, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attack was plotted outside of Bulgaria {{for a year and a}} half.|$|R

50|$|The Danish {{national}} security intelligence agency PET concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> organisation Al-Qaeda {{was behind the}} attack. The possibility of either direct Al-Qaida involvement or Al-Qaeda inspired groups is high, due to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attack against <b>the</b> Danish embassy came {{a month and a}} half after Al-Qaeda's then-deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, urged Muslims to strike against Danish targets in the interview published by As-Sahab on 17 April 2008.|$|R
25|$|Seven commandos, {{including}} two officers, {{were injured in}} the battle. A search and clearance operation was started immediately to defuse any IEDs planted by the gunmen within the school premises or in the suicide vests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> were wearing.|$|E
25|$|Following a month-long investigation, the Shin Bet {{security}} service announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{were inspired by}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Reportedly, this confirmed the assessment, previously made by Palestinian {{security service}}s {{on the night of}} the attack.|$|E
25|$|Police {{said they}} were working under the {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> shot in Cambrils were connected to the Barcelona attack and Alcanar explosions. Police chief Josep Lluís Trapero believed terrorists {{were in the process}} of manipulating the gas canisters when they exploded, after which they decided to continue their plans by conducting more rudimentary vehicle ramming attacks.|$|E
50|$|It {{was in this}} {{background}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> group Montoneros, led by Fernando Abal Medina were formed to support Peron's return to Argentina.|$|R
40|$|I nthis paperwe study a two-period {{game between}} a {{government}} and a <b>terrorist,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> decides whether to stockpile attack resources from the first to the second period. Our results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> chooses stockpiling when: (a) the following parameters are in intermediate ranges: the government’s asset valuation, <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> first-period resource, <b>the</b> govern-ment’s unit defense cost, and <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> unit attack cost; (b) <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> second-period resource is small; and (c) <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> resource growth factor or discount factor is large. We also compare our model with <b>the</b> one <b>that</b> does not allow terrorist stockpiling. For moderate growth factors and second-period resources for <b>the</b> <b>terrorist,</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> does not prefer the option of stockpiling. <b>The</b> <b>terrorist</b> prefers stockpiling for <b>the</b> more uncommoncase <b>that</b> thegrowthfactor for <b>the</b> <b>terrorist’s</b> stockpiled resource is very large and the second-period resource is very small. In contrast, the government always prefers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> has <b>the</b> stockpiling option...|$|R

25|$|The {{standoff}} {{was significant}} because both these countries were nuclear nations, having first successfully tested {{nuclear weapons in}} 1974 and 1998 respectively. The countries had already participated in 4 wars since their partition and independence in 1947, and {{relations between the two}} nations have been strained throughout their histories. The lone surviving terrorist of the Mumbai attacks confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> came from Pakistan, and that they were trained by Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives. In 2011, he also confessed that the ISI had been supporting them throughout the attacks.|$|E
25|$|During the 27 {{years it}} has been active, {{five members of the}} GEO have died. The unit has had only one {{casualty}} in combat, which occurred during the assault on the Leganés flat where the suspected perpetrators of the Madrid train bombings of 11 March 2004 were hiding. Having realised that they were trapped, the terrorists detonated bombs in the flat killing themselves and GEO Subinspector Francisco Javier Torronteras Gadea. This fatality was probably caused {{by the fact that the}} agents who entered the flat didn't know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> could have explosives.|$|E
25|$|Police {{initially}} {{thought it}} was an accidental gas explosion, but hours later believed the explosion was caused by stockpiled explosives accidentally going off. A Moroccan man was injured in the explosion and taken to the hospital, he is to be questioned by police. The explosive TATP and 120 canisters of butane and propane were found inside the house. Catalan bomb squads carried out a controlled explosion at the property where the gas canisters were stored. There was speculation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> intended to take trucks loaded with explosives and combustible gas to attack the Sagrada Família.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{measures}} <b>the</b> {{direct costs}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks of March 11 caused {{on the economy}} of the region of Madrid. The evaluation has been made applying a conservative criterion, and the results obtained have to be considered as minimum. <b>The</b> result indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks caused a loss of nearly 212 million euros to the regional economy of Madrid, equivalent to 0, 16 per cent of the regional GDP (0, 03 of the national GDP). This confirms <b>that</b> <b>the</b> immediate economic dimension of a terrorist attack such as the one of March 11 apart from human catastrophic consequences is relatively low. ...|$|R
25|$|India claims these insurgents are Islamic {{terrorist}} groups from Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Afghanistan, fighting to make Jammu and Kashmir {{a part of}} Pakistan. They claim Pakistan supplies munitions to the terrorists and trains them in Pakistan. India states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> have killed many citizens in Kashmir and committed human rights violations whilst denying that their own armed forces are responsible for human rights abuses. On a visit to Pakistan in 2006, former Chief Minister of Kashmir Omar Abdullah remarked that foreign militants were engaged in reckless killings and mayhem {{in the name of}} religion. The Indian government has said militancy is now on the decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{decision}} for the authorities was whether the prisoners should be released. Palme gave the orders for preliminary release at 21:00. The cabinet met at 22:00 and by 23:00 it had concluded that the prisoners were to be transported to Bulltofta as an intermediate measure. There were at the time rumors <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrorists</b> were Serbs who had the intention of murdering the Croatians once they were on board the aircraft. The cabinet therefore decided that the prisoners would only be let on board if they agreed to themselves, after consulting with the hijackers. However, the issue was complicated around midnight when the Bulltofta base of operations received a threat by telefax which threatened to kill Palme, Geijer and two other ministers if the prisoners were handed over.|$|E

Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein said there were [...] "no easy answers" [...] and that he was not surprised Comedy Central took the threat seriously, but added, [...] "in a democracy, artists and political satirists should be allowed to say what they believe, even if it offends some of its audience". Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant suggested Comedy Central actually drew more attention to the Muhammad controversy, not less, by censoring the episode.
