5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation {{was made with}} the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|SVT {{made the}} advance {{decision}} to allocate Denmark at one semi-final and Norway at the other, in {{consideration for the}} number of Danish and Norwegian fans likely to come, with the arena being relatively small and so not suitable for accommodating both countries' fans at one semi-final event. Øresund bridge was eventually also used as the main artistic medium for <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contest, as an expression of binding cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Hills {{chronicles the}} lives of several young women living in Los Angeles, California. Every {{installment}} commences with a voice-over narrative from series leads Lauren Conrad (seasons 1–5) or Kristin Cavallari (seasons 5–6), foreshadowing <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode. Each season concludes with a finale, typically involving a major event such as a progressing relationship or a personnel departure.

5|$|The team wanted <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game to {{resonate}} with children; they initially considered {{the idea of}} expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored {{the concept of a}} child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. Although the framework of the story was completed prior to Studio Ghibli's involvement with the game, they still took part in many discussions regarding some ideas, including the game's final scenes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{marriage}} songs {{is mostly}} {{related to the}} selection of groom and the girl's wishes regarding it.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work is Jesus as the conqueror of {{the works}} of the devil, who is {{frequently}} mentioned as the serpent. The music is festively scored, using two horns, similar to Part IV of Bach's later Christmas Oratorio. The text by an unknown poet is organised in eight movements, beginning with a choral movement on the biblical text, followed by a sequence of recitatives and arias which is structured as three stanzas from three different hymns. Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols.|$|E

5|$|Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike is {{a comedy}} play written by Christopher Durang. The story {{revolves}} around the relationships of three middle-aged single siblings, two of whom live together, and takes place during a visit by the third, Masha, who supports them. They discuss their lives and loves, argue, and Masha threatens to sell the house. Some of the show's elements were derived from works of Anton Chekhov, including several character names, the play's setting in a cherry orchard, and <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible loss of an ancestral home.|$|E
5|$|Wild Eagle {{operates}} {{with two}} open-air steel and fiberglass trains, each with seven cars which have four seats each, with two {{on each side}} of the track for a total of 28 riders per train. Riders are restrained by flexible over-the-shoulder restraints and interlocking seat belts. Also, because the seats are on the side of the track, a cantilevered steel arm is used to support the wings. The front of each of the seven train cars is shaped to resemble an eagle with outstretched wings adding to <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ride.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm was {{inspired}} by a passage in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Bard was the English king Edward I's conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh bard upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson Richard II.|$|E

5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when festive music was permitted. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
