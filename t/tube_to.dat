5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} inserted into the endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E

Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the <b>Tube</b> <b>to</b> Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} a third jury consumed {{a year and}} a half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe. Doctors used a silver <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> repair his windpipe, and Desha survived. On {{the last day of the}} court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet empaneled a jury. Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son. Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon, records show that he served out the rest of his term. The pardon damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{termination of}} the line at Elephant & Castle presented the opportunity for the line to be extended further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the Lord Mayor of London announced a proposal for the Bakerloo <b>Tube</b> <b>to</b> be extended to the Crystal Palace via Camberwell Green, Dulwich and Sydenham Hill, but nothing was done to implement the plan. In 1921, the LER costed an extension to Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and in 1922 plans for an extension to Orpington via Loughborough Junction and Catford were considered. In 1928, a route to Rushey Green via Dulwich was suggested. Again, no action was taken, although the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee approved an extension to Camberwell in 1926.|$|E
5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E

5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay <b>Tube,</b> <b>to</b> Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, with {{a return}} to {{normality}} after the First World War, Pick began developing plans to extend the Underground network out into suburbs that lacked adequate transport services. The only major extensions made to the Underground network since the three tube lines had opened were {{the extension of the}} District Railway to Uxbridge in 1910, and the extension of the Bakerloo <b>tube</b> <b>to</b> Watford Junction between 1913 and 1917. Approved schemes put on hold during the war were revived: the CLR was extended to Ealing Broadway in 1920, the Hampstead tube was extended to Edgware between 1923 and 1924 and the C was reconstructed and extended to Camden Town between 1922 and 1924. Finance for the latter two extensions was obtained through the government's 1921 Trade Facilities Act which underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. For new lines, Pick first considered extending Underground services to the north-east of London where the mainline suburban services of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER) were poor and unreliable. Studies were carried out for an extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to New Barnet and Enfield or on a new route to Wood Green and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to Chingford and Ongar, but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.|$|E
50|$|At {{each end}} of the shell, a sheet of {{sufficient}} thickness usually made of stainless steel is provided, with holes for the <b>tubes</b> <b>to</b> be inserted and rolled. The inlet end of each tube is also bellmouthed for streamlined entry of water. This is to avoid eddies at the inlet of each <b>tube</b> giving rise <b>to</b> erosion, and to reduce flow friction. Some makers also recommend plastic inserts at the entry of <b>tubes</b> <b>to</b> avoid eddies eroding the inlet end. In smaller units some manufacturers use ferrules <b>to</b> seal the <b>tube</b> ends instead of rolling. To take care of length wise expansion of tubes some designs have expansion joint between the shell and the tube sheet allowing the latter to move longitudinally. In smaller units some sag is given <b>to</b> the <b>tubes</b> <b>to</b> take care of tube expansion with both end water boxes fixed rigidly to the shell.|$|R
