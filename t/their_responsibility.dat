The Buddhist Sala was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of Thailand. The Buddha found inside {{was a gift from}} the Thai government and is over 1000 years old. Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala, as it is <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> to care for it.|$|E
5|$|Ford Road {{remained}} in township jurisdiction until August 29, 1924 {{when it was}} transferred to Wayne County control. It was transferred again to state control on December 2, 1930. The Michigan State Highway Department designated it M-153 upon transfer to <b>their</b> <b>responsibility.</b> The highway designation was determined to continue west of the county line into Washtenaw County as a northerly bypass of Ann Arbor, but the segment between Canton Center Road and US12 on Plymouth Road was not built at the time. The first extension west was finished in 1933 from the county line to Napier Road. The road was widened into a major thoroughfare between Detroit and Ann Arbor in 1934, to relieve congestion on Michigan Avenue. The highway bypass of Ann Arbor was cancelled by 1935, leaving the western terminus at US12 (Plymouth Road).|$|E

5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{introduced}} a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was {{a breach of}} peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Gross requested that South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Chang Myon, be present for the meeting, which was granted. The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was {{not a member of}} the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity, and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

5|$|Watts (Terry O'Quinn) is {{a former}} FBI {{assistant}} director {{and a member of}} the Millennium Group. Watts is Black's initial mentor in the group, and they investigate cases together as partners. Although Watts' faith in the group is shaken when he discovers <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> for a deadly viral outbreak, he is reluctant to leave and fights Black's attempts to sabotage and expose the group's work. He convinces Emma Hollis to join the group, using a potential cure for her father's illness as leverage. After Watts leaks a folder of sensitive group documents to Black to aid his crusade, he is attacked in his home by an assassin from the group and presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to <b>their</b> <b>responsibility</b> for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E
