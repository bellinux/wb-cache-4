Findings: This paper has investigated the effect of the tool orientation on the variation effective cutting speed, on the surface texture, while multi-axis milling. Experimental results have shown that disadvantages of three axes machining results from the existence of very low cutting speeds, even null when the tool axis is normal to the machined surface. This mode of machining generates a bad surface quality. Surfaces have a poor topography and important anisotropy. A suitable slope of the cutting tool by the means of the fifth machine tool axis, improves considerably work piece machined surface quality; Good micro-geometrical surface topography and lower surface roughness. Research limitations/implications: A possible future work would be the development of a general the phenomenal of the residual stress of the cutting on the five axis machining.

25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the <b>tool.</b> <b>Tilting</b> the <b>tool</b> by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|R

Tool axis inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the <b>tilt</b> of cutting <b>tool</b> or <b>tilt</b> of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5].
