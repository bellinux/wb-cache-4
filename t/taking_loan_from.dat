I run a simultaneous three-stage-least square model to control for the endogeneity and identify the interplay between usage of credit, savings, and vulnerability. I find that no variable significantly influences the usage of any form of credit, which has a significant and positive impact on savings and vulnerability through <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> informal sources. I also find strong evidence of a substitution effect between <b>taking</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> formal sources and <b>taking</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> informal sources, since the two are asymmetrically correlated with vulnerability.

40|$|Abstract: Goyal (1985) is {{frequently}} cited when the inventory systems {{under conditions of}} permissible delay in payments are discussed. Goyal implicitly assumed that: 1. The unit selling price and the unit purchasing price are equal; 2. At {{the end of the}} credit period, the account is settled. The retailer starts paying for higher interest charges on the items in stock and returns money of the remaining balance immediately when the items are sold. But these assumptions are debatable in real-life situations. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to modify Goyal’s model to allow the unit selling price and the unit purchasing price not necessarily be equal to reflect the real-life situations. Furthermore, this paper will adopt different payment rule. We assume that the retailer uses sales revenue during the permissible credit period to make payment to the supplier at the end of the credit period. If it is not enough to pay off the purchasing cost of all items, the retailer will pay off the remaining balance by <b>taking</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> the bank. So, the retailer starts paying for the interest charges on the amount of loan from the bank after the account is settled. Then the retailer will return money to the bank at the end of the inventory cycle. Under these conditions, we model the retailer’s inventory system as a cost minimization problem to determine the retailer’s optimal cycle time and optimal order quantity. Four cases are developed to efficiently determine the optimal cycle time and the optimal order quantity. Numerical examples are given to illustrate these cases. Comparing with Goyal’s model, we also find that the optimal cycle times in this paper are not longer than those of Goyal’s model...|$|E

As part of my BBA program, I have completed my three months internship program from a reputed bank “BRAC Bank Ltd”. During my internship time, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience {{in the field of}} banking. So based on my learning and experience from the organization I have completed my internship report on “BRAC Bank SME Financing”. In this paper I have tried to focus and analyze the SME financing process of BRAC Bank Ltd. In the report I have discussed the SME products that the bank offers, the strategies they follow for the individuals <b>taking</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> the bank, the monitoring process. This bank offers different SME products which suits the different customer needs. They are: • Anonno Rin • Apurbo Rin • Digoon Rin • Prothoma Rin • Pathshala Rin • Supplier Finance • Aroggo Rin • Cash Secured Loan • Bizness Account I have basically discussed about the current environment they are dealing with. I have tried to find out the basic appraisal of SME loan. I have also tried to know the enterprise and entrepreneur selection criteria to provide SME loans, terms and conditions of the loans, the disbursement and recovery procedures of the loans and the reconciliation process. Finally based on all the findings I tried to make some relevant recommendations. From my personal view the learning aspect was fruitful and the experience there will help me in the future. I have learnt many aspects of banking. Working with the bank was a great learning opportunity. Fahmida SultanaB. Business Administratio...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} faced by micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs) is difficulties of capital. To overcome this problem, SMEs borrow from various parties, {{one of which is}} a banking. However, SMEs are still difficulties in accessing funds from banks due to a variety of requirements that can not be fulfilled. This study aims to analyze the total assets, profits, long effort, interest rate perceptions, sex, education, and age in influencing the decisions of SMEs in Kudus to take credit from the banks. This study uses primary data collected from 100 respondents in the sample with simple random sampling technique. The method used in this study is the logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of variable total assets, profits, old effort, interest rate perceptions, sex, education, and age on the probability of SMEs <b>taking</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> banks.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess impact of BCC microcredit program on livelihood improvement of the respondent households. Specifically the study evaluated the client’s changes of livelihood on income, food adequacy, assets, capital, health and education and to assess factors that influence the loan repayment performance. Purposive sampling procedure was applied to select a sample size of 123 respondents that were the BCC beneficiaries who have received loan for a period of more than one year. Interviews and questionnaires were used as main data collection tools and the collected data were analyzed using qualitative, descriptive, paired t-test and logistic regression model. The findings of this study (p-values < 0. 05) reveal that there was a significant improvement in overall family annual income, number of meals taken per day, ability to buy assets, access to health and education services and business value after <b>taking</b> <b>loan</b> <b>from</b> BCC microcredit program. Specifically the study reveals that the mean income increased from 500, 000 to 1, 500, 000 Tsh while the business capital changed from 500, 000 to 2 million Tshs and the number of meal increased from 1 to 3 meals per day before and after taking loan respectively. The results from the multivariate linear regression model indicate that business experience influences positively while amount of loan received influence negatively the loan repayment performance. Based on the findings, we recommend the flexibility on loan amounts, increase of loan repayment period and ongoing training to borrowers on loan use and entrepreneurship and close supervision to increase the loan repayment rate. The government also should formulate policies that will facilitate the CBO MFIs like BCC to access various services such as regulated risk management, health insurance and other financial facilitating services...|$|E

This study, therefore, researched how and why Namibia stayed free from Bretton - Woods’ loans and why it eventually broke that tradition. The research found that Namibia had no economic crisis, whatsoever, warranting World Bank or IMF interventions; on the contrary, it strengthened a hypothesis advanced by Laila Smith 5 suggesting that the World Bank uses its knowledge brokering role as a device to foster lending relationships with countries that initially refused to do so. The research therefore suggests that careful and informed engagement with the World Bank and IMF will be crucial if Namibia is to attain its developmental goals as outlined in its Vision 2030...|$|R

50|$|Some {{states have}} laws {{limiting}} the number of loans a borrower can take at a single time according to LATimes report. This is currently being accomplished by single, statewide realtime databases. These systems are required in Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia States Statues. These systems require all licensed lenders to conduct a real time verification of the customer's eligibility to receive a loan before conducting a loan. Reports published by state regulators in these states indicate that this system enforces all of the provisions of the state's statutes. Some states also cap the number of loans per borrower per year (Virginia, Washington), or require that after a fixed number of loan renewals, the lender must offer a lower interest loan with a longer term, so that the borrower can eventually get out of the debt cycle by following some steps. Borrowers can circumvent these laws by <b>taking</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> more than one lender if there is not an enforcement mechanism in place by the state. Some states allow that a consumer can have more than one loan outstanding (Oklahoma). Currently, the states with the most payday lenders per capital are Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma.|$|R

In the Rhodian period, where Delos was {{not a member of}} the League, the synedrion assembled on Tenos. As the League's sole collective organ, the synedrion was a sort of legislative council with representatives (σύνεδροι, synedroi) appointed by the member states. It assembled on an ad hoc basis. Since no chairman is mentioned, it was probably headed by the nēsiarchos. The synedrion awarded honours and distinctions to benefactors, and levied both regular and extraordinary financial contributions (συντάξεις, syntaxeis or εἰσφοραί, eisphorai) for maintenance of the League's military and for the common festivals. These funds were administered by a treasurer (ταμίας, tamias). Surplus funds were available for other projects, e.g. the setting up of the League's decrees on inscribed stelae in the member states. In another indication of the Leagues' federal character, the synedrion could not only require financial contributions from its members, but also punish them for non-compliance. In practice, both the League as well as the member states often had to resort to <b>taking</b> <b>loans</b> <b>from</b> the Sanctuary of Apollo on Delos to cover expenses.
