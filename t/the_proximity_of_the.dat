5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland {{to those in}} Ireland is not entirely clear. Given <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds caused by <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach {{in excess of}} 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter {{the presence of a}} subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which can last for several days.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war. The annexation led to the town's defences being dismantled; it was considered indefensible, as it was within easy firing range of the nearby Mont des Récollets, and it would have cost far too much to fortify both hills. In addition, the revised frontier following the treaty was now a significant distance from Cassel and without <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city centre, the Žirmūnai {{bank of the}} River Neris {{is covered}} with a strip of dense {{deciduous}} forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E

40|$|URL] This article did a {{theoretical}} contraposition among the ideas developed by Antonio Negri and Maurizio Lazzarato and those proposed by Andre Gorz. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this confrontation was verified by <b>the</b> differences and <b>the</b> <b>proximities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arguments these authors develop about the “immaterial work” category. Therefore, we studied {{a theoretical}}-analytical conceptual approach presented by these respective authors on their essays.

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{was only}} their eighth {{football}} meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 {{advantage in the}} series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold out before the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman road, entrenchments and relics {{it seems}} that the {{earliest}} settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station.

5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. <b>The</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

5|$|Further afield, {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July, a group {{representing}} Pakistani madrasahs, {{headed by}} Maulana Salimullah Khan, {{called for an}} immediate cessation of the Lal Masjid operation.

5|$|Strachan was unsurprised at the French reaction, and {{returned}} fire immediately, <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships preventing any manoeuvres. Within twenty minutes the combat was decided, the French captain hauling down his colours with his ship battered {{and more than}} 60 men wounded or dead. The French ship carried significantly weaker cannon than Phoenix, with 6 and 12 pounder guns to the 9 and 18 pounders aboard the British squadron. In addition, Résolue was heavily outnumbered: no other French warships were in the area while the British had three large frigates within sight. French losses eventually totalled 25 men killed and 60 wounded, Strachan suffering just six killed and 11 wounded in return.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate {{from that of the}} rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E

An inevitable tension exists between {{the needs of the}} 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the needs of the many millions of people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the rim, and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. <b>The</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E
