5|$|In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed Laelaps trihedrodon Cope 1877 into Megalosaurus trihedrodon. In {{the same}} {{publication}} Nopcsa renamed Poekilopleuron valens Leidy 1870 into Megalosaurus valens; this probably represents fossil material of Allosaurus. In 1902, Nopcsa named Megalosaurus hungaricus {{based on two}} teeth found in Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The specimens, MAFI ob. 3106, were later lost. It represents an indeterminate theropod. In 1903, Louis Dollo named Megalosaurus lonzeensis based on a manual claw found near Lonzee in Belgium. He had first reported this claw in 1883, {{and as a result}} some sources by mistake indicate this year as the date of the naming. It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae, or an indeterminate member of the Coelurosauria. In 1907/1908, von Huene renamed Streptospondylus cuvieri Owen 1842, based on a presently lost partial vertebra, into Megalosaurus cuvieri. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae. In 1909, Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus woodwardi, based on a maxilla with tooth, specimen BMNH 41352. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> seen as a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda.|$|E

25|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, {{the number of}} English plesiosaur discoveries rapidly increased, {{although}} these were all of {{a more or less}} fragmentary nature. Important collectors were the reverends William Mounsey and Baptist Noel Turner, active in the Vale of Belvoir, whose collections were in 1795 described by John Nicholls {{in the first part of}} his The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicestershire.

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically {{under the name}} Ixocomus sibiricus by American mycologist Rolf Singer in 1938, based on material that was collected under Pinus cembra var. sibirica in the Altai Mountains of central Asia. In 1945, he transferred it to Suillus. Alexander H. Smith called the species Boletus sibiricus in 1949, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> considered a synonym. Singer named the subspecies [...] S.sibiricus subsp. helveticus in 1951, based on material collected [...] by Jules Favre from Switzerland in 1945. Roy Watling later considered this a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate description, and therefore failing to qualify as a formal scientific name.|$|E
500|$|The California Gold Rush {{brought the}} first people of European descent known to visit the {{immediate}} area. In December 1849 two groups of California Gold Country-bound white travelers with perhaps 100 wagons total stumbled into Death Valley after getting lost on {{what they thought was}} a shortcut off the Old Spanish Trail. Called the Bennett-Arcane Party, they were unable to find a pass out of the valley for weeks; they were able to find fresh water at various springs in the area, but were forced to eat several of their oxen to survive. They used the wood of their wagons to cook the meat and make jerky.

2500|$|... "Misty" [...] {{served as}} Todays theme until 1971, when NBC News {{correspondent}} Frank McGee joined the show. Composer Ray Ellis penned {{an entirely new}} instrumental theme entitled [...] "This is Today", a jazzy, up-tempo piece {{that served as the}} program's main theme until 1978.

2500|$|In 1901, Lawrence Lambe {{found some}} {{incomplete}} remains, holotype CMN 930, and named them Ornithomimus altus, {{placing them in}} the same genus as material earlier described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890. The specific name altus is from Latin, meaning [...] "lofty" [...] or [...] "noble". However, in 1914, a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5339) was discovered by Barnum Brown at the Red Deer River site in Alberta, prompting O. altus to be described as the type genus of a new subgenus, Struthiomimus, by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1917. Dale Russell made Struthiomimus a full genus in 1972, at the same time referring several other specimens to it: AMNH 5375, AMNH 5385, AMNH 5421, CMN 8897, CMN 8902 and ROM 1790, all partial skeletons. The type species, S. altus, is known from several skeletons and skulls, In 1916 Osborn also renamed Ornithomimus tenuis Marsh 1890 into Struthiomimus tenuis. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> considered a nomen dubium. In 2016, ROM 1790 was made the holotype of a new genus and species, Rativates evadens.|$|E
