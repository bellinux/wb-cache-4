40|$|In India, {{railways}} {{are under}} the control of the government which is the sole provider of the infrastructure, operations and regulatory functions. Private participation, though very limited, was largely in the domain of infrastructure creation. In January 2006, in a landmark initiative to introduce competition in the container operations segment, the Ministry of Railways allowed the entry of private and public sector operators to obtain licences for running container trains on the Indian Railways (IR) network. Until then, the Container Corporation of India, a subsidiary of IR, was the monopoly operator of container trains in India. This initiative was the first significant move of its kind where private parties were allowed to make entry in the domain of railway operations with direct customer interfacing. The response to the policy was good and 15 new entrants obtained licences to run container trains. Due to lack of clarity or inconsistency in matters pertaining to haulage charges, maintenance of wagons, <b>transit</b> <b>guarantees</b> from IR and terminal access charges, operators started feeling skeptical about the viability of the business. This paper examines the current policy environment from the point of view of business viability for 15 new Container Train Operators and brings out issues related to licensing, pricing, terminals, maintenance, and service levels.

50|$|As of April 12, 2012, Great Sudbury <b>Transit</b> has <b>guaranteed</b> seven bus routes (101, 182, 301, 501, 701, 702, 703) {{that will}} always be {{equipped}} with bike racks. Cyclists wishing to bring their bikes on other routes are permitted to bring their bike on-board according to the driver's discretion (e.g. not during rush-hour etc.). City staff have indicated that following the construction to the new transit garage there will theoretically be sufficient space within to equip the whole fleet with bike racks. There is not enough space within the current garage to accommodate the additional 0.8 m required per bus with a bike rack.|$|R

5000|$|Education {{and jobs}} {{are vital to}} sustain {{the needs of the}} youth who reside within the hub. Approximately 50,000 green collar jobs may be created within the next five years; {{possibly}} replacing blue collar jobs. Land in Ontario that is traditionally for agricultural use may be affected by the [...] "Green Energy Hub." [...] This hub may become the central component in the sustainable energy grid of the future. As people learn to dispose less and sustain more of the environment around them, youthful businessmen will learn to take advantages of the economic potentials of the Green Energy Hub; allowing them to escape the welfare programs that currently entraps their parents. These new jobs will be especially found in Brantford; where access to an established railroad link and future GO <b>Transit</b> terminus may <b>guarantee</b> the economic future of the region. Access to GO Transit service will be available by 2020; facilitating the flow of people who work in jobs related to the Green Energy Hub in addition to interurban trade to cities like Windsor, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.|$|R
40|$|Over {{two decades}} of exoplanetology have yielded {{thousands}} of discoveries, yet some types of systems are yet to be observed. Circumstellar planets around one star in a binary have been found, but not for tight binaries (< 5 AU). Additionally, extra-solar moons are yet to be found. This paper motivates finding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical probabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual inclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body motion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and make it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5 - 10 yr. Circumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational challenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature that {{may be difficult to}} identify. This may help explain their present non-detection, or maybe they simply do not exist. Whilst this paper considers binaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries favourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes {{to the point of being}} <b>guaranteed.</b> <b>Transits</b> of exomoons exhibit a similar behaviour under precession, but unfortunately only have one star to transit rather than two.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a Hub Location Problem arising in Telecommunication Network Design. The {{considered}} network presents two different kinds of nodes: access nodes, that represent source and destination of traffic demands but cannot be directly connected, and transit nodes, that have no own traffic demand but collect traffic from access nodes and route it through the network. Transit nodes {{are supposed to be}} fully connected. Given a set of access nodes and a set of potential locations for the transit nodes, the problem is to decide number and positions of the <b>transit</b> nodes to <b>guarantee</b> that all access nodes are allocated to a transit node, satisfying capacity constraints. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the network, which is the sum of connection costs and nodes fixed costs. The problem is a Hub Location Problem, which is known to be NP-hard. A local search approach is proposed, and different metaheuristic algorithms, such as tabu search, iterated local search and random multistart, have been developed, based on such local search. [A preliminary procedure has been developed in a research project joint with Telecom Italia (Turin Research & Innovation Laboratories) and a patent application has been filed to cover this issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Current mobile {{communication}} systems allow data centric applications while the user is in <b>transit.</b> To <b>guarantee</b> high data throughput, the required bandwidth has to rise {{along with the}} user expectation. To avoid a bandwidth shortage, the 800 MHz digital dividend has been released as LTE band over Europe. State-of-the-art modems employ a dedicated separate receiver per receive band, relying on external high quality filters to suppress out of band blockers. External filters limit the linearity requirements for the receiver and therefore also current and area consumptions. Both of them influence operation time, costs of the integrated circuit and competitiveness of the product. Goal must be to reduce the sheer amount of receive paths without increasing the power consumption of the receiver. In this thesis a frequency agile filter concept for {{mobile communication}} receivers has been investigated, that allows for full integration in a modern CMOS process. It {{is based on the}} frequency translation of a filter transfer function. The heart of the concept is a passive mixer and a capacitor, which can be regarded as a lowpass. The mixer translates the lowpass transfer function into the RF domain so that bandpass behaviour is achieved. Since each receiver is driven by an integrated frequency synthesizer, the centre frequency of the filter can easily shifted to the wanted receive band using a passive mixer. Large filter tuning ranges can be covered, limited by the tuning range of the synthesizer, only. Most importantly, the presented homodyne receiver has the advantage that the channel frequency and the synthesizer frequency are identical. The ultimate goal to avoid any external filters depends on the harmonic rejection of the receiver. Since mixers typically are driven by square wave signals, the harmonic rejection is low. High inherent harmonic rejection is therefore another important target for this work. Multiple testchips prove the functionality of the concept. Different LNA topologies as well as a complete receiver show a good performance in the measurements. The receiver covers a frequency range of 500 to 900 MHz with a flat gain and 8 dB noise figure. The harmonic rejection is as high as 52 dB and concumes 47 mW Power...|$|R
40|$|In {{streets with}} reduced space availability, {{sensitive}} environment uses, important connections between both street sides and with strong use competitions the design {{with the traditional}} guidelines cause more and more problems. In such streets the unconventional constructions of tracks which are advised in the recommendations {{for the design of}} main streets (EAHV 93) can be integrated better. However, there are only partial investigation results and application recommendations available for these tracks. Therefore, the destination of the presented work was to elaborate such application recommendations, especially for mixed mode streets with spatial separation of the traffic types and tracks with medium high kerbs. In addition the traditional tracks were included into the studies. The results of the empirical studies showed, that a good traffic flow for the public <b>transit</b> can be <b>guaranteed</b> in streets with unconventional tracks considering the application areas. The obstructions for the public transit vehicles expected by the transportation companies could only be observed outside of these application areas. Further, the studies showed that the other goals of a classical street design can also be guaranteed. This in particular applies to the road safety of the traffic participants {{and the quality of the}} traffic flow of motor, bicycle as well as foot traffic. However, goals of the goal-fields 'environment' and 'street design' can be considered correspondingly. (orig.)

40|$|Far from {{protecting}} the environment, most rail transit lines use more energy per passenger mile, and many generate more greenhouse gases, {{than the average}} passenger automobile. Rail <b>transit</b> provides no <b>guarantee</b> that a city will save energy or meet greenhouse gas targets. While most rail transit uses less energy than buses, rail transit does not operate in a vacuum: transit agencies supplement it with extensive feeder bus operations. Those feeder buses tend to have low ridership, so they have high energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile. The result is that, when new rail transit lines open, the transit systems as a whole can end up consuming more energy, per passenger mile, than they did before. Even where rail transit operations save a little energy, the construction of rail transit lines consumes huge amounts of energy and emits large volumes of greenhouse gases. In most cases, many decades of energy savings {{would be needed to}} repay the energy cost of construction. Rail transit attempts to improve the environment by changing people's behavior so that they drive less. Such behavioral efforts have been far less successful than technical solutions to toxic air pollution and other environmental problems associated with automobiles. Similarly, technical alternatives to rail transit can do far more to reduce energy use and CO 2 outputs than rail transit, at a far lower cost. Such alternatives include the following: Powering buses with hybrid-electric motors, biofuels, and [...] where it comes from nonfossil fuel sources [...] electricity; Concentrating bus service on heavily used routes and using smaller buses during offpeak periods and in areas with low demand for transit service; Building new roads, using variable toll systems, and coordinating traffic signals to relieve the highway congestion that wastes nearly 3 billion gallons of fuel each year; Encouraging people to purchase more fuel-efficient cars. Getting 1 percent of commuters to switch to hybrid-electric cars will cost less and do more to save energy than getting 1 percent to switch to public transit. If oil is truly scarce, rising prices will lead people to buy more fuel-efficient cars. But states and locales that want to save even more energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will find the above alternatives far superior to rail transit...|$|R
40|$|Shared-use {{mobility}} systems, which {{enable users}} to have short-term access to transportation modes on an on-demand basis, have experienced tremendous {{growth over the}} last decade. However, most of the existing systems suffer from two confounding issues: the lack of modeling tools to understand, simulate and predict their behavior {{and the lack of}} integration with the existing transit network. To address those issues, this dissertation focuses on investigating the operational challenges of bikesharing systems, with an emphasis on the rebalancing operations and the modeling of a new mobility concept, Car 2 work, which builds upon existing carsharing ideas and successfully integrates with existing transit networks. A methodological framework to solve the bikesharing rebalancing problem is proposed. The novelties of the approach are that it is proactive instead of reactive, as the bike redistribution occurs before inefficiencies are observed, and uses the outputs of a demand-forecasting technique to decompose the inventory and the routing problem. The decomposition makes the problem scalable, responsive to operator inputs, and able to accommodate user-specific models. Simulation results based on data from the Hubway bikesharing system show that system performance improvements of 7 % in the afternoon peak could be achieved. Car 2 work main goal is to connect commuters with workplaces while leveraging the line-haul capabilities of existing public <b>transit</b> systems and <b>guaranteeing</b> a trip back home, efficiently tackling the “last mile” problem that is a limiting characteristic of public transit. It differs from the traditional dynamic-ridesharing approaches because it is designed for recurrent commuting trips where commuters announce their (multiple) trips in advanced and an automated all-or-nothing matching strategy is performed, guaranteeing a ride home. The problem is formulated as a pure binary problem that is solved using an aggregation/disaggregation algorithm that renders optimal solutions. The solution approach is based on decomposing the problem into a master problem and a sub-problem, reducing the number of decision variables and constraints. As a result, various instances of the problem can be solved in reasonable amount of time, even when considering the transit network. The model can be used to simulate a widespread implementation of the concept...|$|R
