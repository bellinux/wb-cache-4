Ryabkov expressed his opinion that a comprehensive agreement between the P5+1 and Iran will require no ratification. [...] "We are negotiating a binding document, but under a generally recognized doctrine international political liabilities are equated with legal," [...] he said and admitted that some resolutions of the Security Council on Iran will need to be adjusted.|$|R

We expect thereto be a continuing increase in both the number <b>of</b> international <b>agreements</b> and conventions on safety, security, and <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> nuclear materials, and the number of U. S. -Russian agreements for the safety, protection, and <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> weapons and excess defense materials. This inventory <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> and conventions may soon expand into broad, mandatory, international programs that will include provisions for inspection, verification, and transparency, To meet such demand the community must build on the resources we have, including State agencies, the IAEA and regional organizations. By these measures we will meet the future expectations for monitoring and inspection of materials, maintenance of safety and security, and implementation <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{tension in}} the WTO between {{adaptation}} to globalization and integration of developing countries is illustrated {{by one of the}} central norms <b>of</b> the regime, <b>transparency.</b> Experts believe democratic governance and efficient markets are both enhanced when autonomous administrative agencies are open about what they doing. WTO requirements for regulatory transparency may prove to be more straightforward for OECD countries than developing countries. The future of the WTO as a legitimate and effective international organization depends on finding modes of regulation accessible to all its Members. A review of how Canada, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, and Uganda implement the <b>transparency</b> requirements <b>of</b> the <b>agreements</b> on basic telecommunications, and sanitary and phytosantitary measures found that regulatory independence and transparency are increasingly prevalent in telecommunications, but much less so in food safety. Transparency between countries appears easier than transparency within countries, and economic regulation seems easier to adapt to international norms than social regulation. ...|$|R
40|$|From 2009, {{the quality}} of care in nursing homes in Germany is inspected, rated, and publicized. This study investigates the {{association}} between staff-perceived nursing quality, clinical quality indicators, and ratings of health insurance medical services based on the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> stationary care <b>agreement</b> (PTVS). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study merging publicly reported data, clinical quality indicators of a national health provider system, and data from staff surveys. Data from 83 nursing homes were adjusted for sample size, age, and care level and analyzed using Kendall's tau coefficients and scatter plots. RESULTS: There were pronounced differences in staff-perceived nursing quality and some of the clinical indicators between facilities that were not detected by the PTVS. There was a weak association between staff-perceived quality and care quality rated by external inspections. No associations were found between the PTVS and clinical quality indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between nursing home providers were detected to varying degrees by the three approaches and were if at all weakly associated. Given the aims followed by public reporting initiatives of nursing home providers, the results stress the importance of revising the PTVS...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} two period model of {{political}} competition in which voters imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect observability generates {{an incentive for}} candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than {{in a world of}} perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, {{and the size of the}} debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues. We show that the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending is beneficial, but <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending. 1...|$|R

The proposed integrated index shows the actual share of suggested indicators in the published non-financial reports.

40|$|The digital society demands greater {{institutional}} and political transparency, inuenced by the openness and accessibility {{characteristics of the}} Internet. The election campaign {{is the time for}} political parties to show how they want to act in government. This research aims to analyze what the parties say about their commitment to transparency and how transparent they are, in fact, during the electoral campaign. Thus, it tries to measure the level <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> Partido Popular and Ciudadanos during the election campaigns of 2015 and 2016 for the General Elections. For this, a quantitative and semi- qualitative content analysis was approached from the project of Dader, Campos and Quintana (2011) on the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the organization, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the campaign activity, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the participation with the citizens, <b>Transparency</b> <b>of</b> data and computer tools and the transparency portal.

Without any public <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> information, particulary in terms of the completion of criminal cases (crime clearance) by the police, then how can the public contribute to monitor the criminal justice system.

The following conclusions are drawn based on the analysis of the data in 2008. 1. When the financial performance is better, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> information disclosure is higher. 2. When the ownership is more concentrated, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> information disclosure is worse. 3. There is no significant correlation between board size and information disclosure transparency. 4.
