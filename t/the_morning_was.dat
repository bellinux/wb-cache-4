5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, England's bowlers {{continued}} to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of the day, and the debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. McCabe, who had hit two boundaries thus far in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>was</b> joined by Jack Badcock. The former {{continued to}} score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg glance and late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. McCabe had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since {{he had come to}} the crease. With all the other specialist batsmen dismissed, McCabe was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but McCabe responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after McCabe had hooked him for six.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E

5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first at}} the home of cricket. Centurion Morris fell at 3/166 and new batsman Miller was trapped lbw for four shortly after. Brown came in at 4/173 and helped Lindsay Hassett rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets. Both men scored slowly, {{averaging}} more than three and half minutes for each run. After putting on a partnership of 43, Hassett was bowled by Yardley, who then trapped Brown for 24 to leave Australia stumbling at 6/225. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace. Australia managed to avoid further collapse a counterattack from the tail saw them to 350 before they bowled England out for 215. The tourists batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day. Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329; Australia had lost 3/33 but steadied to reach stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven. After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409. In 88 minutes of play, Australia had added 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Alec Coxon after lunch without adding to his score for 32, after an 87-run partnership with Miller, with the score at 5/416. Bradman eventually declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. The home team lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs. Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the centuries he made in each of his two previous Tests at Lordâ€™s on the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.|$|E

There are only a few items awaiting transfer to space shuttle Discoverys mid-deck left. The crew enjoyed an hour long mid-day meal with the Expedition 23 crew. The entire joint crew took part in a crew photo, which was followed by a joint crew news conference with U.S., Russian and Japanese media. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, mission specialists Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson and Clayton Anderson took time out to talk with students from Eastern Guilford High School in Gibsonville, North Carolina and with third and fourth graders from that school district. The majority of the crews afternoon was spent off duty.|$|E
25|$|Sadly Johnny Moyes died {{suddenly}} {{on the first}} day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. <b>The</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.|$|E

500|$|On December 18, <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> {{cold and}} rainy {{with a light}} fog. The second day began as {{a copy of the}} first with {{multiple}} Union charges. The Union center was able to breach the center of the Confederate breatworks but were pushed out by a Rebel counterattack. Carpenter led a mounted rescue force of colored soldiers to save white soldiers trapped near a cover bridge on the left flank. Carpenter made several attempts but could not rescue the soldiers. Most of those trapped soldiers would be captured later that afternoon, but released before giving their parole. Later that day the Confederate reinforcements delivered a wild rebel yelling charge on the Union left flank. The white unit adjacent to the 5th USCC was completely routed and the 5th USCC flank was threatened. Ordered to fall back, Carpenter and Brisbin tried to maintain an orderly retreat. Many [...] "colored soldiers" [...] remembering the murder of their comrades during the first battle of Saltville broke ranks to rescue their wounded comrades. The retreat threatened to become a rout. About 4 PM, Union reinforcements arrived and bolstered the Union line. [...] During the night, Confederate forces were forced to retire {{due to the lack of}} ammunition. The next day Union forces buried the dead and helped the wounded. The costly victory marked the highpoint of Stoneman's raid.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook.

That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>was</b> the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night.

Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E

[...] In the first assault, the Constable de Bourbon was killed by the shot of an arquebus.

She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>was</b> filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night.
