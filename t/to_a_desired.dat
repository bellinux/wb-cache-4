5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> location.|$|E

25|$|In Rubik's cubers' parlance, a {{memorised}} {{sequence of}} moves {{that has a}} desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology {{is derived from the}} mathematical use of algorithm, meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when {{it can be used to}} bring the cube closer to being solved.|$|E
25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
40|$|Cognitive agents often {{deliberate}} about preferences among rules. Consider, for example, {{an agent}} with {{the obligation to}} travel to Paris next week leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> travel by train, with the preferences that if the desire to travel by train cannot be met, then there is <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> travel by plane. Such an agent may reason about preferences among rules as follows: • The rule leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> travel by train is preferred to the rule leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> travel by plane, maybe as a second alternative. The train rule may even {{be replaced by the}} plane rule, an example of rule revision, maybe due to experienced train delays. Since such preferences among rules and rule revisions only hold within some contexts, we refer to this kind of reasoning as contextual deliberation. It is a powerful level of abstraction, which can be used <b>to</b> describe <b>a</b> new class of patterns of the coordination o...|$|R

The event-driven software could also automatically respond to changing electricity prices, in as little as five-minute intervals. For example, to reduce the home owner's electricity usage in peak periods (when electricity is most expensive), the software could automatically lower the target temperature of the thermostat on the central heating system (in winter) or raise the target temperature of the thermostat on the central cooling system (in summer).|$|E
25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens consists of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E

25|$|Chemical etching {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies. Silicon wafers were etched using HF, and it was demonstrated that cell adhesion was enhanced only in a specified range of roughness (20–50nm).|$|E
500|$|A {{flexible}} {{search strategy}} tunes SIM Lite's mass sensitivity at each star <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> {{level in the}} habitable planet search. [...] The value of ηEarth (Eta_Earth), the fraction of stars carrying Earth-analog planets, will be estimated by the Kepler Mission some time before SIM Lite launches. One strategy for a habitable planet search is to do a 'deeper' search (i.e. to lower mass sensitivity in the habitable zone) of {{a smaller number of}} targets if Earth analogs are common. A 'shallower' search of a larger number of targets could have been done if Earth analogs are rarer. For example, assuming that 40% of mission time is allocated for the planet search, SIM Lite could have surveyed: ...|$|E
500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

2500|$|Teach pendant: Robot {{positions}} can {{be taught}} via a teach pendant. This is a handheld control and programming unit.

They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine.

2500|$|Navigation and orienteering {{are useful}} {{to find the}} trailhead, then find and follow a route <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> {{sequence}} of destinations, and then an exit. [...] In case of disorientation, orienteering skills are important to determine the current location and formulate a route to somewhere more desirable. [...] At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow. In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and, using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike. Weather (rain, fog, snow), terrain (hilly, rock faces, dense forest), and hiker experience can all impact and increase the challenges to navigation in the wilderness.|$|E

6000|$|... § 66. In {{deciding}} how practically {{to carry out}} the principles of artistic composition, we may derive help by bearing in mind a fact already pointed out--the fitness of certain verbal arrangements for certain kinds of thought. That constant variety in the mode of presenting ideas which the theory demands, will in a great degree result from a skilful adaptation of the form to the matter. We saw how the direct or inverted sentence is spontaneously used by excited people; and how their language is also characterized by figures of speech and by extreme brevity. Hence these may with advantage predominate in emotional passages; and may increase as the emotion rises. On the other hand, for complex ideas, the indirect sentence seems the best vehicle. In conversation, the excitement produced by the near approach <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> conclusion, will often show itself in a series of short, sharp sentences; while, in impressing a view already enunciated, we generally make our periods voluminous by piling thought upon thought. These natural modes of procedure may serve as guides in writing. Keen observation and skilful analysis would, in like manner, detect further peculiarities of expression produced by other attitudes of mind; and by paying due attention to all such traits, a writer possessed of sufficient versatility might make some approach to a completely-organized work.|$|E
