5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the presence of malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, {{but there is little}} evidence that Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> evil eye— that {{compliments}} {{from others}} had negative effect; they {{also believed that}} utterances of a person with kari nakku (black-tongue) had a similarly bad effect. They also believed koti from a poor man watching someone eating a delicious food will cause stomach-aches and dysentery.|$|E
25|$|The Bogomils were dualists or Gnostics (people of knowledge) in that <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> a world {{within the}} body and a world outside the body. They {{did not use the}} Christian cross, nor build churches, as they revered their gifted form and {{considered}} their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Catholicism was {{widespread}} in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the right to freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was {{to see if a}} participant answered yes to the first question, implying that <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Within the group, artistic {{approaches}} and aims varied from artist to artist; however, the artists {{shared a common}} desire to express spiritual truths through their art. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the promotion of modern art; the connection between visual art and music; the spiritual and symbolic associations of colour; and a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting. Members were interested in European medieval art and primitivism, {{as well as the}} contemporary, non-figurative art scene in France. As a result of their encounters with cubist, fauvist and Rayonist ideas, they moved towards abstraction.|$|E

25|$|Many Kabbalistic sources, {{notably the}} Tanya, contain {{statements}} {{to the effect that}} the Jewish soul is qualitatively different from the non-Jewish soul. Some prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea; <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the essential equality of all human souls. Menahem Azariah da Fano, in his book Reincarnations of souls, provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated as Jews, and vice versa. Abraham Cohen de Herrera, another Kabbalist of the same school, quotes Greek, Christian and various Oriental mystics and philosophers without hesitation, and does not mention anything specific about the Jewish souls.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th- and 18th-century Russian Empire, {{believing in}} God's {{presence}} in every human being, these people concluded that clergy and formal rituals were unnecessary. They rejected the secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, and all church ritual, holding that the Bible was the supreme source of divine revelation. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the divinity of Jesus. Their practices and emphasis on individual interpretation {{as well as}} opposition {{to the government and}} church, provoked antagonism from the government and the established Russian Orthodox church. In 1734 the government issued an edict against ikonobortsy condemning them as iconoclasts.|$|E

In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies. However, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an organized participatory democracy and an egalitarian, internationalist vision for society while the fascists emphasize hyper-nationalism and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims.|$|E

25|$|In {{one study}} of Friends in Britain Yearly Meeting, around 30% of Quakers had views that were {{described}} as non-theistic, agnostic, or atheist. Another study of British Quakers, found that of the 727 members of the Religious Society of Friends who completed the survey, 75.1% said that they consider themselves to be Christian; 17.6% did not consider themselves Christian; and 7.3% of the members either did not answer or circled both answers. A further 22% of Quakers did not consider themselves to be a Christian, but fulfilled a definition of being a Christian in that {{they said that they}} devoutly followed the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.

25|$|The {{principal}} {{text of the}} Samkhya school, the Samkhya Karika, {{was written}} by Ishvara Krishna {{in the fourth century}} CE, by which time it was already a dominant Hindu school. The origins of the school are much older and are lost in legend. The school was both dualistic and atheistic. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> a dual existence of Prakriti ("nature") and Purusha ("spirit") and had no place for an Ishvara ("God") in its system, arguing that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. The school dominated Hindu philosophy in its day, but declined after the tenth century, although commentaries were still being written as late as the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Individual deists {{varied in}} the {{critical}} and constructive elements they argued for. Some rejected miracles and prophecies, but still considered themselves Christians because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> what they felt was the pure, original form of Christianitythat is, Christianity as it supposedly existed before it was corrupted by additions of such superstitions as miracles, prophecies, and {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity. Some deists rejected the claim of Jesus' divinity but continued to hold him in high regard as a moral teacher, a position known as Christian deism, exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's famous Jefferson Bible and Matthew Tindal's Christianity as Old as the Creation. Other, more radical deists rejected Christianity altogether and expressed hostility toward Christianity, which they regarded as pure superstition. In return, Christian writers often charged radical deists with atheism.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Bacon, the {{influential}} work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.|$|E

500|$|The {{group of}} composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov {{became known as}} the Belyayev circle, named after their {{financial}} benefactor.

500|$|In a {{break from}} {{standard}} industry practice, Bethesda decided to publish their strategy guide in-house, rather than contracting it out to a third party publisher like BradyGames or Prima Games. The decision resulted from a belief among Bethesda staff that <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> and understood Morrowind more than any external agency and deserved more royalties than were commonly rewarded. Bethesda hired Peter Olafson, a noted game journalist and friend of the company, and they began work on the guide in January 2002, four months prior to release. The resulting product, Morrowind Prophecies Strategy Guide, sold over 200,000 copies as of September 24, 2003.

500|$|Francois {{suggested}} newly famous stage actress Michele Alfa for {{the role}} of Christine, and Renoir went with his wife Marguerite and Zwobada to see her perform in a play. While at the play Renoir noticed Nora Gregor in a box seat in the audience and asked about her during the intermission. He learned that Gregor was the wife of Prince Ernst Rudiger von Stahremberg, an Austrian nobleman. Renoir became friends with Gregor and her husband, getting to know them over several dinners in Paris. Stahremberg was forced to resign his leadership role in the Heimwehra paramilitary fascist partybecause Gregor was Jewish and he was anti-fascist. When Germany annexed Austria in March 1938 Gregor and Stahremberg fled to France. Renoir said they were [...] "in a state of great disarray. Everything <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> was collapsing." [...] Gregor was an actress from the Viennese Burgtheater and had appeared in some films, including Carl Theodor Dreyer's Michael. Gregor's first husband had been the concert pianist Mitja Nikisch, son of the renowned conductor Arthur Nikisch of the Leipzig Opera and according to film theorist Charles Drazin, a possible inspiration for some characteristics of Octave.|$|E
500|$|<b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> {{empowering}} {{children by}} {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit".
