25|$|<b>The</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> of a {{parabolic}} antenna {{is that a}} point source of radio waves at the focal point {{in front of a}} paraboloidal reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the reflector. Conversely, an incoming plane wave parallel to the axis will be focused to a point at the focal point.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{naturally}} {{flows from}} hot to cold. Work {{is applied to}} cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. Insulation is used to reduce the work and energy needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. <b>The</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by Sadi Carnot in 1824 as a heat engine.|$|E
25|$|The Maxwell–Faraday {{version of}} Faraday's law of {{induction}} describes how a time varying magnetic field creates ("induces") an electric field. This dynamically induced electric field has closed field lines {{similar to a}} magnetic field, unless superposed by a static (charge induced) electric field. This aspect of electromagnetic induction is <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> behind many electric generators: for example, a rotating bar magnet creates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an electric field in a nearby wire.|$|E

25|$|Another type of three-level converter, {{used in some}} adjustable-speed drives {{but never}} in HVDC, replaces the {{clamping}} diode valves by a separate, isolated, flying capacitor connected between the one-quarter and three-quarter points. <b>The</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> {{is similar to that}} of the diode-clamped converter. Both the diode-clamped and flying capacitor variants of three-level converter can be extended to higher numbers of output levels (for example, five), but the complexity of the circuit increases disproportionately and such circuits have not been considered practical for HVDC applications.|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} Coriolis effect is the mass flow meter, an instrument that measures the mass flow rate and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. <b>The</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that {{gives rise to the}} Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> of CCC {{equipment}} {{requires a}} column consisting {{of an open}} tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field {{to act on the}} column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.|$|E

25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} of 1831–1832, Michael Faraday {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> of electromagnetic generators. [...] The principle, later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying magnetic flux, as for example, [...] a wire moving through a magnetic field. [...] He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk, a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. [...] It produced a small DC voltage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} moment in physics {{is derived from}} the {{mathematical}} concept of moments[...] The principle of moments is derived from Archimedes' discovery of <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> of the lever. In the lever one applies a force, in his day most often human muscle, to an arm, a beam of some sort. Archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object, the moment of force, is defined as M = rF, where F is the applied force, and r is the distance from the applied force to object. However, historical evolution of the term 'moment' and its use in different branches of science, such as mathematics, physics and engineering, is unclear.|$|E

2500|$|An {{external}} collet is {{a sleeve}} with a (normally) cylindrical inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece {{to hold it}} securely. Most often this is achieved with a spring collet, made of spring steel, {{with one or more}} [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered gauge blocks) held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). Regardless of the collet design, <b>the</b> <b>operating</b> <b>principle</b> is the same: squeeze the collet against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction.|$|E
