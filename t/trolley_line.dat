5|$|Soon after {{settlement}} of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally bypassed the village to the north was relocated southward {{to go through the}} growing settlement. The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852. Modern NY175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather the length of a former <b>trolley</b> <b>line</b> that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga. This <b>trolley</b> <b>line</b> parallels the relocated alignment.|$|E
5|$|The first horsecars ran to Lynn in 1854 {{under the}} Lynn and Boston Street Railway.

5|$|Tourism {{opportunities}} in the watershed of Roaring Brook include the Steamtown excursion line, the Lackawanna <b>Trolley</b> <b>line.</b> A city park known as Oakmont Park is {{in the vicinity of}} the stream. There are extensive areas of asphalt in the park, but adding green infrastructure has been proposed. A 142-acre public park known as the Nay Aug Park is also in the watershed. It was founded and 1893 and was popular until the 1950s, when the area entered an economic decline. The park once had a wooden roller coaster and a small zoo, the latter of which was reopened in 2003. There is a ball field at the mouth of the stream.|$|E

The <b>trolley</b> <b>lines</b> were originally run by different companies, until their consolidation by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company in 1906. The trolleys run in a tunnel from the Drexel University and University of Pennsylvania campuses to a loop around City Hall.

25|$|In 1941, the Boston Elevated Railway {{bought the}} BRB {{right of way}} from Day Square to Revere Beach {{for use as a}} {{high-speed}} <b>trolley</b> <b>line</b> similar to the Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line; these plans were delayed by the onset of World War II. However, the 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945–47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the BBRB route rather than using it for a <b>trolley</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt Island {{had been}} {{connected}} to Manhattan by a <b>trolley</b> <b>line</b> that {{crossed over the}} Queensboro Bridge from its opening in 1909. Trolleys to and from Queens stopped {{in the middle of}} the bridge to meet an elevator, which then took passengers down to the island. As the only connection to the rest of the city from the island, the trolley remained in service until April 7, 1957, long after most other trolley service had been dismantled in the city, and was the last <b>trolley</b> <b>line</b> in New York State; it was replaced by buses. At that time, a bridge to Queens was completed, requiring a roundabout trip to reach Manhattan.|$|E
