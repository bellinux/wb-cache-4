5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because of <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was {{made all the more}} dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E

5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E

5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts of}} the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally {{be put on the}} king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> gathering a Parliament again.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly went before the Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some businesses were short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis of <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> {{negotiations with the}} Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat's diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series of discussions between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat {{had been able to}} regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E

Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under Deny Flight also {{played an important role in}} shaping the rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
