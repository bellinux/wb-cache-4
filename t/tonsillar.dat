5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the dura mater looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar <b>tonsillar</b> ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar <b>tonsillar</b> ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
5|$|Playing with a <b>tonsillar</b> {{infection}} {{for most}} of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during breaks in games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from which he never woke. Gardiner died at age 29, on Wednesday, June 13, 1934, from a brain hemorrhage brought on by the infection.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, cutaneous focal mucinosis, cutaneous leiomyoma, breast cancer, <b>tonsillar</b> cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy may be {{indicated}} if {{bad breath}} due to <b>tonsillar</b> stones persists despite other measures.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{diagnostic}} {{techniques can}} identify a radiopaque mass {{that may be}} mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the <b>tonsillar</b> zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic tonsillitis, <b>tonsillar</b> hypertrophy, peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, phlebolites, ectopic bone or cartilage, lymph nodes, granulomatous lesions or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament {{in the context of}} Eagle syndrome (elongated styloid process).|$|E
25|$|Tonsilloliths or <b>tonsillar</b> concretions {{occur in}} up to 10% of the population, {{frequently}} due to episodes of tonsillitis. While small concretions in the tonsils are common, true tonsilloliths or stones are rare. They commonly occur in young adults and are rare in children.|$|E
25|$|Electrocautery: Electrocautery uses {{electrical}} energy {{to separate the}} <b>tonsillar</b> tissue and assists in reducing blood loss through cauterization. Research {{has shown that the}} heat of electrocautery (400°C) may result in thermal injury to surrounding tissue. This may result in more discomfort during the postoperative period.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{suspected}} causes of <b>tonsillar</b> herniation including: decreased or malformed posterior fossa (the lower, back {{part of the}} skull) not providing enough room for the cerebellum; hydrocephalus or abnormal CSF volume pushing the tonsils out; or dural tension pulling the brain caudally. Connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, can be associated.|$|E
25|$|The tongue {{receives}} its {{blood supply}} {{primarily from the}} lingual artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery. The lingual veins, drain into the internal jugular vein. The floor of the mouth also receives its blood supply from the lingual artery. There is also a secondary blood supply to the tongue from the <b>tonsillar</b> branch of the facial artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery.|$|E
25|$|Clinicians may {{recommend}} tonsillectomy for recurrent throat {{infection with}} a frequency {{of at least}} 7 episodes {{in the past year}} or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and {{one or more of the}} following: temperature >38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, <b>tonsillar</b> exudates, or positive test for Group A Beta- hemolytic strep.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tonsillar</b> epithelia (palatine and lingual) {{share similar}} nonkeratinization {{characteristics}} with the cervix, where HPV infection plays the {{major role in}} cases of cervical cancer. Also E6 and E7 may make HPV+OPC more immunogenic than HPV-OPC, since anti-E6 and E7 antibodies may be detected in these patients. This in turn could restrict the malignant behaviour of HPV+OPC {{and the presence of}} antibodies has been associated with a better prognosis, while treatment may enhance the immunogenicity of the tumour, and hence improve response, although to what extent is not clear. Outcomes are also associated with improved adaptive immunity.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency ablation: Monopolar {{radiofrequency}} thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency {{energy to}} the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or local anesthesia. After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size {{over a period of}} several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. <b>Tonsillar</b> tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the <b>tonsillar</b> fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving {{device with}} {{continuous}} suction often used during sinus surgery. It {{is made up}} of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the <b>tonsillar</b> capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.|$|E
500|$|As the {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, {{it can be difficult}} to make the diagnosis clinically. [...] Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and <b>tonsillar</b> enlargement may also occur in infectious mononucleosis.|$|E
500|$|Charles Robert [...] "Chuck" [...] Gardiner (December 31, 1904– June 13, 1934) was a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} goaltender {{who played for}} the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Gardiner moved {{with his family to}} Canada as a child. Playing all of his junior hockey in or around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Gardiner joined the Chicago Black Hawks in the 1927–28 season. He played seven seasons with Chicago, winning two Vezina Trophies, earning three berths to the First All-Star team, and a berth to the Second All-Star team. In 1934, Gardiner became the only NHL goaltender to captain his team to a Stanley Cup win. A few months after winning the Cup, Gardiner died from a brain hemorrhage brought on by a <b>tonsillar</b> infection, at the age of 29. He became posthumously a charter member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>tonsillar</b> herniation, {{also called}} {{downward}} cerebellar herniation, transforaminal herniation, or [...] "coning", the cerebellar tonsils move downward through the foramen magnum possibly causing compression {{of the lower}} brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as they pass through the foramen magnum. Increased pressure on the brainstem can result in dysfunction of the centers in the brain responsible for controlling respiratory and cardiac function. The most common signs are intractable headache, head tilt, and neck stiffness due to <b>tonsillar</b> impaction. The level of consciousness may decrease and also give rise to flaccid paralysis. Blood pressure instability is also evident in these patients.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tonsillar</b> {{herniation}} of the cerebellum is {{also known}} as a Chiari malformation (CM), [...] or previously an Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM). [...] There are four types of Chiari malformation, and they represent very different disease processes with different symptoms and prognosis. [...] These conditions can be found in asymptomatic patients as an incidental finding, or can be so severe as to be life-threatening. [...] This condition is now being diagnosed more frequently by radiologists, as more patients undergo MRI scans of their heads, especially upright MRI, which is more than twice as sensitive for detecting this condition. [...] Cerebellar <b>tonsillar</b> ectopia (CTE) is a term used by radiologists to describe cerebellar tonsils that are [...] "low lying" [...] but that do not meet the radiographic criteria for definition as a Chiari malformation. [...] The currently accepted radiographic definition for a Chiari malformation is that cerebellar tonsils lie at least 5mm below the level of the foramen magnum. [...] Some [...] clinicians have reported that some patients appear to experience symptoms consistent with a Chiari malformation without radiographic evidence of <b>tonsillar</b> herniation. [...] Sometimes these patients are described as having a 'Chiari [...] 0'.|$|E
2500|$|Grant {{learned in}} 1884 {{that he was}} {{suffering}} from throat cancer.N1 carcinoma of the <b>tonsillar</b> fossa. [...] He had forfeited his military pension when he assumed the Presidency, but Congress subsequently restored Grant to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay.|$|E
2500|$|For further {{evaluation}} of <b>tonsillar</b> herniation, CINE flow studies are used. This type of MRI examines flow of CSF at the cranio-cervical joint. [...] For persons experiencing symptoms but without clear MRI evidence, {{especially if the}} symptoms are better in the supine position and worse upon standing/upright, an upright MRI may be useful.|$|E
2500|$|Tonsilloliths, {{also known}} as tonsil stones, are soft {{aggregates}} of bacterial and cellular debris that form in the <b>tonsillar</b> crypts, the crevices of the tonsils. While they occur most commonly in the palatine tonsils, they may also occur in the lingual tonsils. Tonsil stones are very common. Tonsilloliths have been recorded weighing from 0.3g to 42g.|$|E
2500|$|The Middle Ages saw {{tonsillectomy}} {{fall into}} disfavor; Ambroise Pare (1509) wrote {{it to be}} [...] "a bad operation" [...] and suggested a procedure that involved gradual strangulation with a ligature. This method was not popular with the patients due to the immense pain it caused and the infection that usually followed. Scottish physician Peter Lowe in 1600 summarized the three methods in use at the time, including the snare, the ligature, and the excision. At the time, {{the function of the}} tonsils was thought to be absorption of secretions from the nose; it was assumed that removal of large amounts of <b>tonsillar</b> tissue would interfere with the ability to remove these secretions, causing them to accumulate in the larynx, resulting in hoarseness. For this reason, physicians like Dionis (1672) and Lorenz Heister censured the procedure.|$|E
2500|$|HPV oral {{infection}} {{precedes the}} development of HPV+OPC. Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the basal layer of the epithelium. [...] People testing positive for HPV type 16 virus (HPV16) oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+OPC. Immunosuppression {{seems to be an}} increased risk factor for HPV+OPC. Individuals with TGF-β1 genetic variations, specially T869C, {{are more likely to have}} HPV16+OPC. TGF-β1 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. In 1993 it was noted that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital cancers had a 4-fold increased risk of <b>tonsillar</b> squamous-cell carcinoma. Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC in humans not exposed to smoking and alcohol, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+OPC has not always been clear but it appears that both smoking and HPV infection are independent and additive risk factors for developing OPC. Human herpesvirus-8 infection can potentiate the effects of HPV-16.|$|E

2500|$|Coblation tonsillectomy: This {{surgical}} procedure {{is performed using}} plasma to remove the tonsils. Coblation technology combines radiofrequency energy and saline to create a plasma field. The plasma field is able to dissociate molecular bonds of target tissue while remaining relatively cool (40-70°C), which results in minimal or no damage to surrounding healthy tissue. A Coblation tonsillectomy is carried out in an operating room setting, with the patient under general anesthesia. Tonsillectomies are generally performed for two main reasons: <b>tonsillar</b> hypertrophy (enlarged tonsils) and recurrent tonsillitis. It has been claimed that this technique results in less pain, faster healing, and less post operative care. [...] However, review of 21 studies gives conflicting results about levels of pain, and its comparative safety {{has yet to be}} confirmed. This technique has been criticized for a higher than expected rate of bleeding presumably due to the low temperature which may be insufficient to seal the divided blood vessels but several papers offer conflicting (some positive, some negative) results. More recent studies of coblation tonsillectomy indicate reduced pain and ostalgia; less intraoperative or postoperative complications; lesser incidence of delayed hemorrhage, more significantly in pediatric populations, less postoperative pain and early return to daily activities, fewer secondary infections of the tonsil bed and significantly lower rates of secondary hemorrhage. Unlike the electrosurgery procedure, Coblation Tonsillectomy generates significantly lower temperatures on contacted tissue. [...] Long term studies seem to show that surgeons experienced with the technique have very few complications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the <b>tonsillar</b> fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|E
