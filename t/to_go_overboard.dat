25|$|After this, Captain George Wolfe assumed command, {{having been}} {{appointed}} in April 1801. On 1 July Galatea came into Plymouth after a cruise of 18 {{weeks in the}} Atlantic and off the western islands. Then during October and November {{she was on a}} 28-day cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Here she not only endured fifteen severe gales, but on 1 and 2 November she nearly foundered. Hurricane-force winds sent her mizzen mast and the main and foretop masts over the side, even though she had no sails set. Furthermore, when the mizzen mast went it took one seaman <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> with it and severely injured others. When the winds died down on 3 November, Byng sailed Galatea for Cork. There he jury rigged a rigged a mizzen-mast, main, and foretop-mast. Galatea finally reached Plymouth on 22 November.|$|E

[...] However, a station reported winds of 23mph (37km/h) six hours after Lester passed over Socorro Island. Several ships {{came in contact with}} Lester, with one in the eye reporting hurricane-force winds for 11hours on August 22. The ship in the eye reported rough seas, causing it to roll 33° to each side and thus was responsible for a large amount of cargo <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Millard House in Pasadena, California {{was used}} to {{represent}} {{the outside of the}} fortress of the Albino, while the interior was filmed on Stage 18 in the Paramount lot. The fight scenes were jointly choreographed by Dan Curry and Dennis Madalone, with the scenes filmed over the course of two days. Direct Winrich Kolbe left the choreography completely in Curry and Madalone's hands, but gave them instructions not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b> Whilst filming the scenes, Kolbe had Richard Wagner's opera Götterdämmerung played on a loop throughout. This operatic theme was taken forward by composer Dennis McCarthy in his score for the episode, who said that he abandoned all subtlety, and told the orchestra to [...] "play the battles as battles".|$|E

[...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While he was good at mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands.

60|$|On several starlight nights {{we danced}} {{on the upper}} deck, under the awnings, and made {{something}} of a ball-room display of brilliancy by hanging a number of ship's lanterns to the stanchions. Our music consisted of the well-mixed strains of a melodeon which was a little asthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong, a clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rather melancholy on the low ones, and a disreputable accordion that had a leak somewhere and breathed louder than it squawked--a more elegant term does not occur to me just now. However, the dancing was infinitely worse than the music. When the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon of dancers came charging down to starboard with it, and brought up in mass at the rail; and when it rolled to port they went floundering down to port with the same unanimity of sentiment. Waltzers spun around precariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down to the rail as if they meant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b> The Virginia reel, as performed on board the Quaker City, had more genuine reel about it than any reel I ever saw before, and was as full {{of interest to the}} spectator as it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to the participant. We gave up dancing, finally.|$|E
60|$|We sailed {{out through}} the Golden Gate and set our course south toward {{that part of the}} Pacific where we could hope to pick up with the {{north-east}} trades. And right away things began to happen. I had calculated that youth was the stuff for a voyage like that of the Snark, and I had taken three youths--the engineer, the cook, and the cabin-boy. My calculation was only two-thirds OFF; I had forgotten to calculate on seasick youth, and I had two of them, the cook and the cabin boy. They immediately took to their bunks, {{and that was the end}} of their usefulness for a week to come. It will be understood, from the foregoing, that we did not have the hot meals we might have had, nor were things kept clean and orderly down below. But it did not matter very much anyway, for we quickly discovered that our box of oranges had at some time been frozen; that our box of apples was mushy and spoiling; that the crate of cabbages, spoiled before it was ever delivered to us, had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> instanter; that kerosene had been spilled on the carrots, and that the turnips were woody and the beets rotten, while the kindling was dead wood that wouldn't burn, and the coal, delivered in rotten potato-sacks, had spilled all over the deck and was washing through the scuppers.|$|E

60|$|Our guns had {{all been}} primed, levelled, and had their tompions taken out the night before, in {{readiness}} to repel any assault that might be made. I had only to remove the apron from the after-gun, and it {{was ready to be}} discharged. Going to the wheel, I put the helm hard up, until our broadside bore on the canoes. Then glancing along my gun, until I saw it had a tolerable range, I clapped the segar to the priming, springing back to the wheel, and putting the helm down. The explosion produced a general yell among the savages, several of whom actually leaped into the chains ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard,</b> while Smudge rushed towards me, fiercely brandishing his knife. I thought my time had come! but, perceiving that the ship was luffing fast, I motioned eagerly forward, to draw the attention of my assailant in that quarter. The vessel was coming-to, and Smudge was easily induced to believe it was the commencement of turning round. The breathing time allowed me to mystify him with a few more signs; after which, he rejoined his people, showed them exultingly the ship still luffing, and I make no doubt, he thought himself, and induced the rest to think, that the gun had a material agency in producing all these apparent changes. As for the canoes, the grape had whistled so near them, that they began to paddle back, doubtless under the impression, that we were again masters of the ship, and had sent them this hint to keep aloof.|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently Lida came up {{and touched}} me, saying in her little awe- struck whisper (which has never been conquered), 'Brother, I am sure I saw one of mother's cigarettes.' I said 'Bosh!' {{thinking}} it an utter delusion; {{but she was so}} decided and so frightened, that I told her to go into the saloon, and went forward. A woman was going about the deck, offering the passengers a basket of candies, lights, cigarettes, and cigars. Saving for Lida's words, I never should have recognized her; she was thin to the last degree, haggard, yellow, excessively shabby and forlorn-looking, and with a hollow cough; but as her eyes met mine (those eyes that you say are our water-mark) both of us made a sort of leap as if <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard,</b> and I went up to her at once, and would have spoken, but she cried out, 'What have you done with Lida?' I answered that she was safe, and demanded in my turn where were O'Leary and Jellicoe. 'Drowned, drowned,' she said, 'in the wreck of the Sirius. They'll never trouble you more. But Lida!' I thought that it was safe to take her into the saloon to see Lida, when they fell into each other's arms, and afforded the spectators a romantic spectacle. Don't think I am making a joke of it, for it was tragic enough in the result of the agitation. Blood was choking the poor woman. We could only lay her down on the couch, and happily there were lemons on board. There was a good-natured Irishman who gave me all the help he could, even to the carrying her to his house, where his wife was equally kind. He fetched the priest, a French Canadian, and the doctor, and Lida has been watching over her most tenderly; poor things—-they seem really to have cared for one another, and Lida will be the happier for having done these last duties.|$|E
6000|$|After {{some time}} {{they could be}} seen forward {{appearing}} on the forecastle head, one by one in unsafe attitudes; {{hanging on to the}} rails, clambering over the anchors; embracing the cross-head of the windlass or hugging the fore-capstan. They were restless with strange exertions, waved their arms, knelt, lay flat down, staggered up, seemed to strive their hardest <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b> Suddenly a small white piece of canvas fluttered amongst them, grew larger, beating. Its narrow head rose in jerks--and at last it stood distended and triangular in the sunshine.--"They have done it!" [...] cried the voices aft. Captain Allistoun let go the rope he had round his wrist and rolled to leeward headlong. He could be seen casting the lee main braces off the pins while the backwash of waves splashed over him.--"Square the main yard!" [...] he shouted up to us--who stared at him in wonder. We hesitated to stir. [...] "The main brace, men. Haul! haul anyhow! Lay on your backs and haul!" [...] he screeched, half drowned down there. We did not believe we could move the main yard, but the strongest and the less discouraged tried to execute the order. Others assisted half-heartedly. Singleton's eyes blazed suddenly as he took a fresh grip of the spokes. Captain Allistoun fought his way up to windward.--"Haul, men! Try to move it! Haul, and help the ship." [...] His hard face worked suffused and furious. [...] "Is she going off, Singleton?" [...] he cried.--"Not a move yet, sir," [...] croaked the old seaman in a horribly hoarse voice.--"Watch the helm, Singleton," [...] spluttered the master. [...] "Haul, men! Have you no more strength than rats? Haul, and earn your salt." [...] Mr. Creighton, on his back, with a swollen leg and a face as white as a piece of paper, blinked his eyes; his bluish lips twitched. In the wild scramble men grabbed at him, crawled over his hurt leg, knelt on his chest. He kept perfectly still, setting his teeth without a moan, without a sigh. The master's ardour, the cries of that silent man inspired us. We hauled and hung in bunches on the rope. We heard him say with violence to Donkin, who sprawled abjectly on his stomach,--"I will brain you with this belaying pin if you don't catch hold of the brace," [...] and that victim of men's injustice, cowardly and cheeky, whimpered:--"Are you goin' to murder us now?" [...] while with sudden desperation he gripped the rope. Men sighed, shouted, hissed meaningless words, groaned. The yards moved, came slowly square against the wind, that hummed loudly on the yard-arms.--"Going off, sir," [...] shouted Singleton, [...] "she's just started."--"Catch a turn with that brace. Catch a turn!" [...] clamoured the master. Mr. Creighton, nearly suffocated and unable to move, made a mighty effort, and with his left hand managed to nip the rope.|$|E
