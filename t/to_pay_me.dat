500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because I {{wanted to know what}} it was like to be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
500|$|Berry {{asked for}} a higher fee for Revlon {{advertisements}} after winning the Academy Award. Ron Perelman, the cosmetics firm's chief, congratulated her, saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company. She replied, [...] "Of course, you'll have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> more." [...] Perelman stalked off in a rage. In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, [...] "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 30, 2006, Shirley {{issued a}} further {{statement}} claiming {{he had not}} been paid for his work, and had received threats and insults from people associated with the band: [...] "I've just mixed a really wonderful band with one of the worst sounding recordings ever. It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because last time I commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> and I got all manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{there will}} be no suit anyhow," [...] Vincent said. [...] "As <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> out some other way, I will look after myself, Dan. I believe that fellow Jackson is capable of anything, and I will {{be on the lookout for}} him." ...|$|R
60|$|It was not he whom I {{wished to}} scratch--at least {{as long as}} he let me alone--but M. de Poligny, who took <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> the most assiduous court {{wherever}} I went, for his little schoolboy of a son, till I was almost beside myself with fear that Clement Darpent might believe some false report about me.|$|R
5000|$|Every member had to {{set forth}} 10 pesetas for the common cash box—that is <b>to</b> say, <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> 10 pesetas for lodging and food.|$|R
500|$|Jamila M'Barek {{told the}} court {{that she was not}} with her brother when he {{disposed}} of the body, and in fact, she stated that she had never been to the site. She claimed that she had no role in the killing other than helping her brother, under duress, load the body into his car. She told investigators, [...] "I did not want him to die. I just wanted my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> my allowance. But he didn't {{want to have anything to}} do with it, so a violent quarrel broke out. I left the room because I could not stand to see what was happening".|$|E
500|$|After partnering {{for one of}} Kindt's {{previous}} works, , Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson asked Kindt {{to pitch}} another book. Kindt sent the proposal for MIND MGMT and was happy when it was accepted because Dark Horse was [...] "the only publisher able <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> a living wage and also let me do exactly what I wanted no matter what." [...] The series was initially approved for over 50 issues, but Kindt pruned away excess material and reduced the run to 36 issues. Despite the reduction in length, the final product is still almost {{identical to the original}} pitch. Diana Schutz, editor of 3 Story, was originally slated to work with Kindt again, but the project was handed to newly promoted editor Brendan Wright very early in production. Kindt described their input as [...] "invaluable" [...] and considers Wright to be a collaborator.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Nugent {{suffers from}} hearing loss. [...] He {{said in a}} 2007 interview: [...] "The ear's not too good, {{especially}} with background noise, but that's a small price <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Believe <b>me</b> the journey was worth it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{notwithstanding}} thy caution, cunning Signore, I would hazard {{ten of the}} sequins {{thou art}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that I will go on the morrow into the crowd of San Marco, and challenge thee openly, by name, among a thousand. Thou mayest as well unmask, for I tell thee thou art as well known to me as the lateen yards of my felucca." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{good reason}} why," [...] growled Gernois. [...] "What you ask will take my last cent, and the only {{valuable}} military secret I hold. You ought <b>to</b> be <b>paying</b> <b>me</b> for the information, instead of taking both it and money, too." ...|$|R
500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> if they're gonna put my name in it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers. Also in February, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.|$|E
500|$|In Freedom of Expression®, Kembrew McLeod {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} freedom of expression regarding cultural norms {{and the manner in}} which society allows corporations to influence discourse. McLeod discusses his own pranks, such as his 1998 registration of the phrase [...] "freedom of expression" [...] as a trademark. In 1998, he registered the phrase [...] "Freedom of Expression" [...] as a trademark in the United States, and said he would initiate a lawsuit against individuals who subsequently used this phrase without his permission. McLeod said, [...] "If the ACLU wanted to put out a magazine with [...] title Freedom of Expression, they would have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> royalties." [...] After the telecommunications company AT used the phrase during a marketing campaign, McLeod's attorney sent a cease and desist letter to request that AT stop using his trademarked phrase. In his book Owning Culture: Authorship, Ownership, and Intellectual Property Law, McLeod said that his intention with the registration of [...] "Freedom of Expression" [...] was to initiate social commentary in the media, saying, [...] "I would let the news story itself be the social commentary." [...] The trademarked phrase subsequently fell back into the public domain.|$|E
2500|$|She {{is known}} to have written to Turner Brothers herself on at least one occasion, asking: [...] "What {{are you going to do}} about my case? I have been home 9 weeks now and have not {{received}} a penny– I think it's time that there was something from you as the National Health refuses <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> anything. I am needing nourishment and the money, I should have had 9 weeks wages now through no fault of my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there ain't. There's nothing wrong; and {{if there}} was, what's that to you? I shan't ask you <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{anything}} for <b>me,</b> I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah;--that is {{just what}} I am not {{prepared}} to tell any one who has taken my wife's side till I know that my wife has consented <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that obedience which I, as her husband, {{have a right to}} demand. If Emily will do as I request of her, as I command her,"--as Trevelyan said this, he spoke in a tone which was intended to give the highest possible idea of his own authority and dignity,--"then she may see her child without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} their wages equal the figure the strikers demanded and you refused <b>to</b> <b>pay?</b> Summers told <b>me</b> about that dispute, sir," [...] ventured English Jim.|$|R
2500|$|Roosevelt, {{eager to}} ensure public consent for this {{controversial}} plan, {{explained to the}} public and the press that his plan was comparable to one neighbor's lending another a garden hose to put out a fire in his home. [...] "What do I do in such a crisis?" [...] the president asked at a press conference. [...] "I don't say... 'Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> $15 for it' …I don't want $15 — I want my garden hose back after the fire is over." [...] To which Senator Robert Taft (R-Ohio), responded: [...] "Lending war equipment is a good deal like lending chewing gum. You don't want it back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{why should}} I weep? It is ungrateful, when I have your love, for which this misery {{is but a}} little price <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Kiss <b>me,</b> dear, and go--and never see me more. You will not forget me, I know now that you will never forget me all your life. Afterwards--perhaps--who can tell? If not, why then--it will indeed be best--to die." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHINN Yes, sir. Mr. Cohen {{has been}} very nice about it. He is going <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> <b>pay</b> it off by instalments.|$|R
60|$|I {{could then}} make confession, and surely {{the fact that}} I had paid where clearly {{there was no longer}} any need <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> must earn <b>me</b> {{forgiveness}} and afford proof of the sincerity of my passion.|$|R
60|$|Mal. Ha! 'tis well, and now I am revenged. I was {{in hopes}} thou wouldst have uttered treason, And {{forfeited}} thy head, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>me</b> fully.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't want it," [...] {{replied the}} unfortunate tradesman, [...] "an' I didn't say what I did <b>to</b> make you <b>pay</b> <b>me.</b> If you fellers will let me own twenty cents' worth of ther house I'll be all right, for then I'll {{have a place}} to live, an' I kin get back in ther boot-blackin' bizness agin." ...|$|R

6000|$|Winslow smiled complacently. [...] "There's {{something}} better {{to play on}} here than ward politics," [...] he replied. [...] "There's a material here that--like the mine and the soil--ain't half developed. I reckon I can show Banks something that beats lobbying and log-rolling for contracts.
