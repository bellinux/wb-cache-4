The {{increase in the number}} of hearing loss injuries in the metal stamping industry initiated OSHA’s Special Emphasis Programs in designated industries and locations across the United States. Because occupational hearing loss injuries do not manifest themselves until years later, it is critical that employers install engineering controls immediately in order to protect worker’s hearing and prevent hearing loss injuries. Tumbling machines come in a variety of configurations. In addition to sound absorption material that can be installed on floors, ceilings, and walls, noise covers can also be custom-made and installed on tumbling machines. This study analyzed the effectiveness of custom-made tumbling noise covers in reducing the sound levels generated from the tumbling machines and reducing the operator’s noise exposures. Noise measurements and personal noise exposure were obtained prior to the installation of the noise cover and after the installation of the noise cover. The sound level and noise exposure results indicate that the noise cover is an effective control in reducing the sound levels produced by the <b>tumbling</b> <b>machine</b> and reducing noise exposures for the tumbling operators. Sound levels and operator’s noise exposures can be further reduced through the combination of machine configuration, hearing protection, use of absorption material to cover the walls, ceilings, and floors, enclosing the machines in a separate room, and the use of noise covers over the tumbling machines...|$|E
40|$|While many {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} done on siliceous and metamorphic rocks for both use-wear and post depositional surface modification (PDSM) events, little is known about such experiments on volcanic materials (other than obsidian), and on basalt in particular. Here we present the preliminary results of several experiments related to: a) evidence for basalt use (e. g., butchery and fresh hide scraping) and the subsequent characteristic use-wear patterns that can be seen; and b) post-depositional surface modifications caused by bear (Ursidae) trampling on experimental basalt flakes and subsequent use of these flakes for a tumbling experiment in a special <b>tumbling</b> <b>machine.</b> The results of these experiments were compared to better understand some surface modifications noted on the Middle to Upper Pleistocene lithic assemblages of the Azokh Cave site (Nagorno Karabagh, Lesser Caucasus). Although some aspects of both events (use-wear and PDSM) remain to be studied in depth, the experiments have improved our understanding of the effects of use-wear and post-depositional trampling and tumbling on basalt lithic artefacts. In particular, it has allowed us to recognise mechanical alterations (e. g., cracks, striations, fractures, edge damage) caused by trampling and tumbling and to note differences between these modifications and those caused by use. In particular, the experiments have shown that macroscopic modifications are rarely diagnostic, especially those observed after use. Microscopic wear features such as edge rounding, polish, abrasion and striations were the most evident types of alteration on basalt flakes, although occurring at different times and from different types of use. Distribution and orientation of alterations may be key in distinguishing use-wear from post-depositional alterations on basalt artefacts. </p...|$|E
40|$|NUKEM Technologies was {{contracted}} to supply a dry, automated drum belt (tumbling) Abrasive Blasting Unit (ABU) to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy. The ABU {{was installed in}} the centralised radioactive waste management area of the JRC-Ispra site in Italy. The unit is to be employed for the decontamination to clearance levels of slightly contaminated metal components and, where practical, concrete or heavy concrete (density ~ 3200 kg/m³) blocks arising from the dismantling of nuclear facilities. The presentation {{is based on the}} successful construction and installation of the ABU at the JRC Ispra site. Among the several possibilities of adapting conventional abrasive units to nuclear applications, an automatic <b>tumbling</b> <b>machine</b> was preferred, due to the larger output and (mainly) for the ease of operation, with minimum direct handling of contaminated material by operators, thus satisfying the ALARA principle. Consideration was also given to Belgoprocess' successful experience with a predecessor, similar unit. After adequate size reduction batches of up to about 800 kg of material to be decontaminated are automatically introduced into the blasting chamber. Pieces between 100 mm and 800 mm long, between 100 mm and 500 mm wide and between 5 mm and 300 mm high can be effectively treated in the unit, the maximum weight of a single piece being limited to 100 kg. Pipes less than 300 mm long and with an internal diameter larger than 40 mm and other components with hard-to-reach surfaces may be included. The content of the chamber is tumbled by two bladed drums, while sharp steel grit is sprayed onto the contaminated components, thus removing the surface layer including any contamination. From experience, 30 minutes of treatment is sufficient to remove contamination to levels below expected clearance levels for most materials. The decontaminated components are removed from the blasting chamber automatically and collected in skips. Dust and grit are led to a series of separators; the grit gets recycled to the blasting chamber, cleaned off contaminants such as paint are fed to collection bins, and the dust is bagged into waste drums. Airflow through the whole system cleans the decontaminated components, transports the dust to the collecting area, and acts as a dynamic barrier to limit risks of contamination of the surrounding areas. Prior to release back into the room, the air is filtered in a series of automatically cleaned filters, followed by HEPA filters. The whole facility is operated in an automatic mode: the operators are only required to place drums or pallets of contaminated material onto the feeder, and remove skips of decontaminated material and drums of secondary waste such as dust. The presentation will describe the system and potential applications in the nuclear industry in detail. JRC. C. 1 -Nuclear Decommissionin...|$|E

40|$|On {{background}} of the framework of Sustianability, this thesis aims at understanding Energy consumption in households, and uses the example of Norway as having three times higher electricity consumption per capita than the OECD average. The work is inspired by interdisciplinarity and thus makes use of several approaches. The main methodological tool is in-depth interviews, conducted with 19 households. Two main analytical windows is chosen to understand the field, hereunder everyday life and household technologies (washing <b>machines,</b> <b>tumble</b> dryers and dishwashers). Theoretically, the thesis makes use of Pierre Bourdieu {{and the concept of}} habitus, Marianne Gullestads sociological writings on everyday life, as well as applying Actor-Network theory (Bruno Latour) and Domestication (Roger Silverstone) to looking at the processes of interaction between users and household technologies. However, the various approaches are fused by a focus on practice. The work argues that in the everyday life practices that together form the amount of energy use in households, people are not guided by the directly reflexive processes of thinking about rationality, economy and sustainability but rather by routines and habits within the semi-conscious domain of habitus. Moreover, an important finding is the aspect that we cannot predict the cosnequences of a technology. When working with the notion that for example installing a more energy efficient washing machine will lead to an decrease in energy consumption, we need to also pay attention to the concrete practices of use...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{efficiently}} {{facilitate the}} energy transition {{it is essential}} to evaluate the potential of demand response in practice. Based on the results of a Dutch smart grid pilot, this paper assesses the potential of both manual and semi-automated demand response in residential areas. To stimulate demand response, a dynamic tariff and smart appliances were used. The participating households were informed about the tariff day-ahead through a home energy management system, connected to a display installed on the wall in their living room. The tariff was intuitively displayed: self-consumption of photovoltaic generation was stimulated by means of a low tariff, but also the generation itself played a central role on the display. Household flexibility is analyzed, focusing on: (i) the load shift of (smart) appliances, and (ii) the response of the (overall) peak load towards the dynamic tariff. To assess the latter, i. e. price responsiveness, the participants were split up in two comparable groups which were subject to a different moment of evening peak-pricing. Based on the results, it is concluded that mainly the flexibility of the white goods (i. e. the washing <b>machine,</b> <b>tumble</b> dryer and dishwasher) is used for demand response. The main part of the flexible load of these (smart) appliances is shifted from the evening to the midday, to match local generation. This load shift remained stable {{over a long period of}} time (> 1 year) and is not responsive to the exact moment of peak-pricing. Therefore, it is concluded that a simple and transparent design for dynamic tariffs is sufficient and most effective to stimulate (manual) residential demand response. Such a tariff should emphasize the ‘right’ moments to use electricity, intuitively linked to renewable generation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from a sensitivity analysis regarding the influence of using emission data from Norwegian EPD’s instead of the generic data from Ecoinvent, using different CO 2 eq-factors (for electricity in the operational phase) and electricity load from household appliances on the overall ZEB residential building performance. The materials which contribute the most to the embodied greenhouse gas emissions in the original ZEB concept residential building were selected [1]. The sensitivity analysis is performed by replacing the generic Ecoinvent data with Norwegian EPD data where available. Even though the embodied emissions from PV contribute the most emissions, they {{are not included in}} this analysis {{due to the lack of}} Norwegian EPD data for PV. Instead, the influence of different PV technologies and different module orientations on the embodied and avoided emissions is incorporated. Even if the calculation of embodied emission has uncertainties, the results indicate the annual embodied emissions reduction from 7. 2 kg CO 2 eq/m 2 to 5. 8 kg CO 2 eq/m 2 when the generic data is replaced with Norwegian EPD data. In addition, the sensitivity study investigates the influence of CO 2 eq-factors for electricity in the operational phase on the emission balance. Furthermore, the analysis discusses the energy consumption of electric appliances and how it could be reduced through more efficient products, especially the hot-fed machines (i. e. washing <b>machines,</b> <b>tumble</b> dryer and dishwasher). The ZEB Centre has chosen an average CO 2 eq factor of 132 g CO 2 eq/KWh for electricity in the operational phase of the building's lifetime of sixty years. ZEB ambition level ZEB-OM can still not be reached for the residential concept building. However, to choose higher European CO 2 eq factors make it possible to achieve this ambition. In further work, the calculation of embodied emissions using Norwegian EPD data for other construction materials should be incorporated. In the second stage of the work, the system boundary should be extended to include end of life emissions. There is further potential to reduce the embodied emissions by considering the biogenic carbon stored in wood products and the use of alternative building materials should also be considered. In addition, further work is thus required to define the potential energy saving that would result from a shift of standard appliances to high-performance appliances with better energy efficiency. © Copyright SINTEF Academic Press and Norwegian University of Science and Technology 201...|$|R
40|$|Tumble dryers are {{becoming}} more and more common in ordinary households as a complement to the washing <b>machine.</b> <b>Tumble</b> dryers offer a fast drying cycle independent on weather conditions and require small space. They do, however, considering the large number of units use a large amount of electricity. The main objective in this thesis is to identify possibilities in order to reach a reduced electricity use for domestic tumble-drying of clothes. This involves an investigation of the condensing tumble dryer in order to point out possible energy efficiency improvements. The purpose of the energy label, which indicates the energy efficiency of the tumble dryer, is also studied, whether it matches the actual laundry habits. Finally, suggestions for technical development of the tumble dryer are made in line with today’s consumer behaviour. The performance of the condensing tumble dryer has been studied using a design of experiments to create a statistical model in Paper I. This model was used to find the best settings for the power supply to the heater, the internal airflow and the external airflow in order to reach a high specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) and a low leakage ratio. A low external airflow and high power supply to the heater gives the highest SMER. To reach the lowest values for the leakage ratio, a low internal airflow should be applied together with a high external airflow. The use of a statistical model gave valuable information of the performance of the existing tumble dryer. For further improving the energy efficiency of the dryer, the amount of leakage and its location was investigated in Paper IV. By studying energy and mass balances from experiments, pressure measurements and modelling, the effects of leakage on the process were evaluated. As the location of the leakage is so important for the energy efficiency, the worst-case scenario where leakage is located between the heater and the drum is used as a start point in the study. It was determined that there is a large leakage of air between the heater and the drum leading to a significant loss in energy recovery. The drying loads used by consumers are getting smaller, often less than 3 kg dry load, while the maximum capacity of the dryers are increasing, up to 7 or 8 kg. In Paper II, tests were made with different loads in order to investigate if the energy label serves its purpose as today’s standard is set at the dryers’ maximum capacity. The results from this study show that the energy efficiency when drying a small load is significantly lower than for a large load. In order to encourage a production of tumble dryers with higher energy efficiency for small loads, where the dryer is most frequently used, the standards for the energy label should be revised. Today, manufacturers do not gain any benefits by improving the performance for partial loads. A mathematical model over a venting tumble dryer was established in Paper III with the aim of testing different control strategies in order to improve the energy efficiency of the tumble dryer for partial loads. The ideas behind the different strategies were to minimize the heat losses during the drying process and to increase the residence time for the air in the drum and thereby increase the moisture content of the air leaving the drum. Using such a control strategy it is possible to reach an improvement of SMER by approximately 4 % when drying small loads. In order to reach larger improvements, however, a more extensive product development will be necessary. Finally, the results in this thesis points at the necessity of including not only the technical development of the tumble dryer, but also the policy tools involved and the consumers’ habits in order to reach a reduced electricity use for drying clothes in households. ...|$|R
40|$|A PV/T {{collector}} {{has been}} developed and evaluated {{at the department of}} Energy and Building Design at the Technical University of Lund, LTH in Sweden. The PV/T, a “solar window” made of PV cells laminated on solar absorbers is placed in a window behind the glazing. The solar window is built into a single family house, Solgården, in Älvkarleö outside Gävle {{in the eastern part of}} Sweden. To reduce the costs of the solar electricity reflectors have been placed in the construction to focus light onto the solar cells. In this way expensive solar cells can be replaced by considerably cheaper reflector material. The tiltable reflectors give the user a possibility to control the amount of sunlight being let into the building. The reflectors can also be used to reduce the thermal losses through the window. A calculation model for electricity and hot water production was created. The simulation program, in Excel, can perform yearly energy simulations where different effects such as shading of the cells or the glazing effects can be included or excluded. The simulation can be run with the reflectors in an active, up right, position or with the reflectors in a passive, horizontal, position. The simulation programme was calibrated against a prototype window placed in Lund in the south of Sweden and against the solar window in Solgården Älvkarleö. The calculation model serves as a basis for the module written for the simulation program TRNSYS. A “TRNSYS-deck” was built and calibrated for the building Solgården. The energy balance for the system shows that the control of the reflectors is of great importance. A good control strategy for the reflectors can lower the annual energy demand and improve the indoor climate. A control mechanism that incorporates the indoor and outdoor temperatures can for instance decide to open the reflectors during summer nights to cool the building. Yearly simulations of the energy balance for a house with the solar window was compared to simulations where the 16 m 2 solar window was replaced with a 8 m 2 normal window. The results show the annual amount of auxiliary is lower with a developed solar window compared to the normal window case. The developed solar window has considerably lower U-values than the existing solar window. A simulation was run to investigate the over heating of the building using different control strategies for the reflectors. The simulation was also run for the normal window. The results show that the reflectors of the solar window work fine as a sun shade, keeping the overheating to a minimum. A normal window has to be supplemented with a sun shade of some kind to keep the over heating during the summer on an acceptable level. An Improvement of the solar window that can be of great importance is to add some sort of low-e coating on the glazing to reduce the U-value even further. However, it must be taken into account that the transmittance of the glazing will be affected in a negative way if low-e coating is added. Lower transmission means lower electricity and hot water production. Other improvements that can be made are better insulation of the reflector and the absorber. The most important way to improve the annual electricity production is to use better solar cells. Today cells of standard quality with an efficiency of about 16 - 17 % can be obtained. The electric system at Solgården is built up around a battery bank that can be charged from the solar window, the Stirling generator or from the grid. To have continuous power for some time during a black out and also the relatively low fuse that is needed for the house are two advantages with this system. Simulations show that the day to day storage of electricity in the batteries evens out the power peaks from the load and the electric production, and that further storage is of limited use. Simulations show that the production of electric energy from a combination of solar cells and a Stirling generator is in good agreement with the load during the full year. Solgårdens two parallel electric systems, 230 V and 12 V, has many advantages such as electric security and low energy consumption. To save electric energy is of extra interest when solar cells are used as an energy source. Due to the high price for solar cells large energy saving investments ought to be made before a solar cell installation is economically interesting. To move the energy use from electricity to hot water use is profitable for a stand alone house since solar heating and bio fuel is considerably cheaper compared to solar electricity. <b>Tumble</b> driers, washing <b>machines</b> and dishwashers can for instance use a circulating hot water system instead of electricity in order to minimize the electric use. Normally the energy balance between produced electric energy and produced thermal energy is in better agreement if hot water is used instead of electric energy. Other important investments to make the electric usage more efficient are to use low energy light bulbs and modern kitchen appliances, pumps, fans and computers. This can save as much as 80 % of the electricity compared to old standard techniques. Solgården is in practice working with the main fuses of the sizes of 3 - 4 A only. This can be accomplished because of the battery bank and since no equipment with a high current demand is connected to the power system. A high slope of the PV-modules has the advantage that the power during the summer is decreased. On the other hand a module tilt of 45 ° is to prefer both from an energy and a power view. A 45 ° tilted module gives a higher annual output in kWh per monitored kWp than a vertical module...|$|R
