5|$|The {{three major}} {{producers}} of strontium as celestine as of 2015 are China (150,000t), Spain (90,000t), and Mexico (70,000t); Argentina (10,000t) and Morocco (2,500t) are smaller producers. Although strontium deposits occur widely in the United States, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been mined since 1959.|$|E
5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts {{a struggle for}} resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

5|$|Baker's {{work has}} {{achieved}} cult {{status in the}} years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published.

Two other books have been optioned for films, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been produced.|$|E
5|$|Eris {{was never}} officially {{classified}} as a planet, and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> cleared their neighbourhoods.

Pluto itself is now recognized as {{being a member of the}} Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more-massive Eris.|$|E

The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for several days to monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
