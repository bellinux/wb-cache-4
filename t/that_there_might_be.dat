The company stated that it would co-operate with EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, and banks, to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks' time.|$|E
50|$|Metaphysical {{nihilism}} is {{the philosophical}} theory <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> no objects at all—that is, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a possible}} world {{in which there are}} no objects at all; or at least <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> no concrete objects at all, so that even if every possible world contains some objects, {{there is at least one}} that contains only abstract objects.|$|R

5|$|This {{study has}} been criticized on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that measurement of the northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E
5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific orbital energy and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered {{out of the air}} raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> actual physical quanta of light—what {{we now call}} photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than {{the frequency of the}} light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Early {{calculations}} suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> white dwarfs whose luminosity {{varied with}} {{a period of}} around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this., § 7.1.1; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, {{like that of the}} other pulsating variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial gravity wave pulsations., § 7. Known types of pulsating white dwarf include the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, including HL Tau 76, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA;, pp.891, 895 DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB;, p.3525 and GW Vir stars (sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars), with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs, but are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.|$|E
