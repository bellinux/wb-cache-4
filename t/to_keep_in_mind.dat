5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures {{can be seen as}} processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider {{whether it would be}} something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> {{that not all}} conserved sequences are under selection pressure.

Also, because virtual nature can provide benefits to people (but in a less dramatic way), this may be one way for people who cannot get out in nature to reap some of its benefits.|$|E
25|$|In {{understanding}} the crystal structures of rare-earth borides, {{it is important}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the concept of partial site occupancy, that is, some atoms in the described below unit cells can take several possible positions with a given statistical probability. Thus, with the given statistical probability, some of the partial-occupancy sites in such a unit cell are empty, and the remained sites are occupied.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} more {{extensions}} to Petri nets, however, it is important <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> that as {{the complexity of the}} net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, {{it is a good idea}} to use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.|$|E

25|$|Depth rules: Gas consumption, {{nitrogen}} narcosis and decompression obligation increase with depth, {{and the effects}} of {{nitrogen narcosis}} may be more critical in a cave due to the high task loading and presence of combinations of hazards. Cave divers are advised not to dive to depths exceeding the planned depth and the applicable range of their equipment and the breathing gases in use, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> this effective difference between open water depth and cave depth. Excessive depth is frequently cited as a contributory factor in fatal incidents involving fully trained cave divers.|$|E
25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Ã…land Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|Howe's {{task was}} complex. He had to protect inbound trade convoys from the Americas, {{keep track of}} the Franco-Spanish fleet, while also {{keeping an eye on the}} Dutch fleet at port in the Texel but {{reportedly}} ready to sail. He also had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the need to attempt a relief of Gibraltar which had been under siege for several years and would be forced to surrender if it wasn't resupplied soon. Howe had to accomplish these tasks with significantly fewer ships than his combined opponents. Keppel observed the Royal Navy's best hope was to quickly shift their limited forces from one area of danger to another.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} meaning of Old English [...] was {{the faculty of}} memory, not of thought in general. Hence call to <b>mind,</b> come <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>to</b> have mind of, etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland. Old English had other words to express [...] "mind", such as [...] "mind, spirit".|$|R

25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Greeks put Dionysius in a {{difficult}} position. With the Greek fleet beaten, Mago had gained the option of making a dash at Syracuse itself, repeating the feat the Carthaginians had pulled off at Messene on Syracuse. On the other hand, if Dionysius could now attack and defeat the army of Himilco, Mago would be compelled to fall back to a secure base. However, Dionysius also had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the possibility of political trouble in Syracuse while deciding his strategy. The Greek army was opposed to facing a siege, and at first Dionysius was inclined to seek the Carthaginian army out and measure swords with Himilco. However, his advisers pointed out the threat of Mago and his fleet capturing Syracuse, and Dionysius decided to break camp, leave Catana and march south to Syracuse.|$|E

25|$|When a nucleon {{such as a}} proton or neutron {{is added}} to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it {{to all the other}} nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but {{primarily}} to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.|$|E
