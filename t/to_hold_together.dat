5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E

5|$|Constantinople was {{the nerve}} {{centre of the}} Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's {{remaining}} provinces would have been unlikely <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together,</b> and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, {{the failure of the}} Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation of a huge fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's prestige. Conversely, Byzantine prestige reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|In two warm-up matches {{ahead of}} the World Cup in Australia, Ebsary made 18 and 8 against England and Sri Lanka respectively. Nevertheless, Ebsary was {{retained}} for the match against New Zealand, scoring one at No. 7 as Australia failed in their run-chase. It {{was the start of}} a tournament in which Ebsary was moved around in the Australian team structure. Ebsary was dropped for the second match against South Africa, which Australia won, and recalled for the last group match against the West Indies. She made 15 from 28 balls at No. 5, in a 47-run win to reach the next round. In the first Super Six match, Ebsary made 39 not out from 36 balls at No. 7 in the closing stages of the game, attempting <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> the Australian lower-order as they fell 16 runs short of India's 5/234. She was then promoted to No. 3 in the following match, making 51 from 71 balls against Pakistan after Leah Poulton and Shelley Nitschke had put on a century opening stand, as the Australians completed a 107-run win. Ebsary was left out of the final Super Six match against England, which Australia won, which was not enough for them to reach the final. She missed the third-place playoff against India, which was lost. She ended with 106 runs at 35.33 from her four matches.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E

5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
25|$|The Tezno {{mass graves}} near Maribor were {{discovered}} in 1999 during {{the construction of a}} motorway. There were 1,179 corpses in the excavated strip. In 2007, the Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, founded in 2005, analyzed the Tezno trench and found human remains at a length of 740 metres, estimated to contain the remains of around 15,000 victims. In 2009, the Barbara Pit was uncovered in Slovenia, holding 726 human remains. The same year, more pits were uncovered on two locations near the Croatian-Slovenian border, one near the village of Harmica and the other near Gornji Hrašćan, estimated <b>to</b> <b>hold,</b> <b>together,</b> around 4,500 bodies.|$|E

The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.|$|E

25|$|The Cubists are {{not waiting}} for the war to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together.</b> They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears.

25|$|Hassan Pasha, {{instructed}} by the Sultan Suleiman, assembled soon {{an army of}} 100,000 men among Turks, Algerines {{and a large number}} of Janissaries. This army was supported by sea by a fleet of 30 galleys, 5 French carracks and 15 small vessels under the command of Jafar Catania, governor of Tlemcen. With these forces Hassan went to Mers El Kébir, stronghold whose dominion he considered essential to capture Oran. Meanwhile, Alonso and Martin de Córdoba had received supplies, gunpowder, tools and a few soldiers from Málaga. <b>To</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> both towns in order to help each other, they decided built two forts: San Miguel, located on the hill that separated Oran from Mers El Kébir, and Todos los Santos, facing the second town.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 1840, liberal caudillo Morazán invaded Guatemala with 1500 {{soldiers}} to avenge the insult done in Los Altos. Fearing that such action would end with liberal efforts <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> the Central American Federation, Guatemala had a cordon of guards {{from the border}} with El Salvador; without a telegraph service, men ran carrying last-minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched a plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero in charge of troops who presented only slight resistance in the city. Carrera pretended to flee and led his ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno, with few men, few rifles and two old cannons. The city was {{at the mercy of}} the army of Morazán, with bells of the twenty churches ringing for divine assistance.|$|E

25|$|Criticisms {{extended}} to the supplies for the troops: British soldiers were sent out from England with boots made substantially from cardboard, which rapidly disintegrated {{and had to be}} bound with cloth or string <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together.</b> While the Indian Army was equipped with highly effective Dum-dum bullets produced in India, British bullets sent to Egypt were simply pointed, and 1,000,000 rounds had to have their ends filed off to increase their effectiveness. The rough remodelling meant the bullets were inaccurate at long ranges, giving soldiers a choice of bullets able to hit their target but only wound, or killing bullets which were likely to miss and could jam the guns. Railway engines needed to carry troops and supplies into Sudan had to be obtained {{from all over the world}} as British companies were unable to supply at short notice. By contrast, American companies could supply locomotives immediately which were more effective and cheaper than some obtained from England.|$|E
25|$|After the Dissolution of the monasteries at the English Reformation, the retable {{panel was}} made into the lid of a chest, with the main painted side facing down. The chest was used to store wax funeral effigies of English monarchs, and the {{painting}} was not rediscovered until 1725, when it was drawn by Vertue (British Library). In 1778 serious damage was caused when the chest was modified into a cupboard or display case to show the funeral effigy of Pitt the Elder. Not until 1827, when the Retable was seen by the architect Edward Blore, then Surveyor of the Abbey, published in The Gentleman's Magazine and removed from the chest and set in a glazed frame, was it regarded {{as anything other than}} a curiosity by the Abbey. Since its rediscovery, the piece has been further damaged by attempted restoration efforts, which included a coating of glue intended <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> painted layers. Watercolours of the Retable were made for the Society of Antiquaries of London; a conjectural restoration was included in Viollet-le-Duc's Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français, and plates accompanied William Burges's essays on painted objects at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Between December 1942 and February 1943, Rash Behari {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>together</b> the INA. On 15 February 1943, the Army {{itself was}} put {{under the command}} of Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani. A policy forming body was formed with Lt. Col J.R. Bhonsle, Director of the Military Bureau, in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col. Shah Nawaz Khan as Chief of General Staff, Major P.K. Sahgal as Military Secretary, Major Habib ur Rahman as commandant of the Officers' Training School and Lt. Col. A.C. Chatterji (later Major A.D. Jahangir) as head of enlightenment and culture. A number of the officers and troops who had returned to PoW camps, or had not volunteered in the first place, made it known that {{they would be willing to}} join the INA only on the condition that it was led by Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose was a hard-line nationalist, previously having won the presidency of Indian National Congress in the 1930s in the face of staunch opposition from Gandhi, who disagreed with Bose's approach to radical nationalism. Bose had, at the start of the war in Europe, escaped from house arrest to make his way first to Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Subhas Chandra Bose. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia. He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine, and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to the Indian communities, exhorting them to join in the fight for India's Independence. The INA was revived, and the units of dissolved INA were incorporated into Bose's army. The Hindustan Field Force formed the nucleus of the new INA's 2nd division, to form the 1st Infantry regiment. The first INA therefore formed the nucleus of the army under Bose's leadership, which he proclaimed the army of his Provisional Government of Free India. It drew a large number of civilian volunteers from Indian diaspora in south-east Asia, eventually growing to a unit of almost forty thousand soldiers.|$|E
