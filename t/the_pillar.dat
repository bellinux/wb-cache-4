5|$|On 29 April 1969 the Irish {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Nelson Pillar Act, terminating <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> Trust and vesting {{ownership of the}} site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> had been capable of repair {{and should have been}} re-assembled and rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest <b>the</b> <b>Pillar.</b> They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} a mission to {{discover}} {{the location of the}} Covenant's homeworld, SPARTAN-II soldiers are recalled to Reach. Two days before the mission was to begin, Covenant forces attack Reach and destroy the colony. A starship, <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumn, survives the onslaught with the SPARTAN-II Master Chief on board. The ship initiates a jump to slipspace (similar to hyperspace), hoping to lead the enemy away from Earth. The game starts with <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumn encountering Halo.|$|E

5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of the Underworld {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to the Underworld by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying <b>the</b> <b>Pillar,</b> which would have in turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope with it. In God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace and her voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew {{organizations}} were established. In Harlem alone, {{at least eight}} such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931. The Church of the Living God, <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints of Christ {{is one of the}} largest Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism.

5|$|First Strike {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, under the {{governance}} of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), has been fighting a losing war against a religious collective of alien races known as the Covenant. Humanity's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project, super-soldiers in powered armor, but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC's favor. Following a Covenant attack on Reach, a planet within UNSC jurisdiction, <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner. The Covenant call this relic Halo, and believe it is a weapon and means of transcendence. UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood, by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo. The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, detonate <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumns engines, destroying Halo. Escaping the destruction via a fighter, the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|Master Chief first {{appears in}} the games as the protagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved and the 2003 novelization, Halo: The Flood. During the opening {{cinematic}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief is awakened from cryonic sleep. Upon exiting slipspace, <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumn is attacked by the Covenant and crash lands on Halo, a ring-shaped megastructure. Master Chief escapes the ship via an escape pod. Upon landing on Halo, his first task is to find other survivors. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a {{last line of defense}} against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. At the request of the installation's resident AI 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief retrieves the Index, a device used to activate Halo's defenses and eliminate the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglects to inform the Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving the Flood to death. Cortana intervenes to prevent the activation of Halo. She and the Master Chief destroy it by detonating <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Autumns fusion reactor core. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a Longsword spacecraft, believing they are the only survivors.|$|E

These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E
5|$|The architects in the Karnataka region seem to {{have been}} {{inspired}} by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced {{by the fact that they}} incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were <b>the</b> <b>pillar</b> bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.|$|E

Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>Pillar</b> of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
