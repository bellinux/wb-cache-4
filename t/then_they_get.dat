However, he has also said that, if cut, underwater civilizations would be one of the first things to add via an expansion pack. Though the final version of Spore released to stores had indeed proven the underwater phase had been cut, it is still possible for the player's creature to swim above water. If the player swim too far into the sea, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> eaten by a sea monster, which is probably the present-game Maxis creature, Battered Feesh.|$|E
500|$|Political philosopher Kristján Kristjánsson differentiates {{threats and}} offers by {{explaining}} that the former is a proposal that creates an obstacle, while the latter is one kind of proposal (another example being a request) that does not. He also draws a distinction between tentative proposals and final proposals, which he feels earlier authors ignored. A tentative proposal does not logically create any kind of obstacle for its subject, and, as such, is an offer. For instance, [...] "if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy" [...] is a tentative proposal, as it does not logically entail that a failure to fetch the paper will result in no candy; {{it is possible that}} candy can be acquired by another route. In other words, if the subject fetches the paper, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> candy. By contrast, if the proposal was a final proposal, it would take the form of [...] "if and only if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy". This entails that candy can only be acquired if the subject fetches the paper, and no other way. For Kristjánsson, this kind of final proposal constitutes a throffer. There is an offer to fetch the paper ("if"), and a threat that candy can only be acquired through this route ("only if"). As such, an obstacle has been placed on the route of acquiring candy.|$|E
2500|$|A serve (or, more formally, a [...] "service") {{in tennis}} is a shot {{to start a}} point. The serve is {{initiated}} by tossing {{the ball into the}} air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a [...] "let" [...] and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn't prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> one more try to get the serve in the box.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1875 Leskov went abroad, first to Paris, then to Prague and Dresden in August. In December his story [...] "At the Edge of the World" [...] was {{published}} in Grazhdanin (1875, No. 52). All the while he continued {{to work on a}} set of stories which would later form his cycle Virtuous Ones. Some critics found Leskov's heroes virtuous beyond belief, but he insisted they were not fantasies, but more like reminiscences of his earlier encounters. [...] "I credit myself with having some ability for analyzing characters and their motives, but I'm hopless at fantasizing. Making up things is hard labour for me, so I've always felt the need for having before me real faces which could intrigue me with their spirituality; <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> hold of me and I infuse them with new life, using some real-life stories as a basis," [...] he wrote later in the Varshavsky Dnevnik newspaper. Years of confrontation with critics and many of his colleagues have taken their toll. [...] "Men of letters seem to recognize my writing as a force, but find great pleasure in killing it; in fact they have all but succeeded in killing it off altogether. I write nothing – I just can't!", he wrote to Pyotr Schebalsky in January 1876.|$|E
2500|$|The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was {{actually}} {{signed into law}} on January 8, 2002 by President George W. Bush. It is commonly abbreviated as NCLB. It was a re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and some {{say that it was}} one of the most significant pieces of legislation to affect education in the last 30 years. [...] No Child Left Behind was designed to hold schools accountable for students' proficiency, as determined by testing procedures. NCLB states that the 4 major goals are [...] "stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents, and an emphasis on teaching options that have been proven to work.". The goal of NCLB was to have all students testing at proficient levels by the 2012-2013 school year. It also says that 95% of all eligible students must be taking the SOL tests. [...] "Adequate Yearly Progress" [...] (AYP), which is meeting the target proficiency ratings, must be met by the schools annually. [...] If two consecutive years pass where a school does not meet AYP, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> labeled as [...] "needing improvement", and supplemental services may be offered. [...] No Child Left Behind also regulates employment of teachers, by requiring that all teachers are [...] "highly qualified".|$|E

50|$|If the Purple Gang {{frequently}} {{attacks the}} Capone Mob, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> will <b>get</b> more turns (because, if the Capone Mob blocks {{and takes the}} next turn, then the Purple Gang gets the next turn; the other four gangs are effectively skipped). Similarly, if the Purple Gang frequently blocks the Bank Robbers, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> will <b>get</b> more turns (again, the other four gangs are effectively skipped). However {{there is always the}} risk that a mob other than the Capone Mob will use family influence or mob power to save that person's mobster. This point emphasizes the importance of alliances with other mobs.|$|R
