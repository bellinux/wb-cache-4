40|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} heat from one fluid to another without mixing them, the fluids {{are separated by}} impermeable walls. An increased heat transfer rate {{can be achieved by}} extending these walls with fins and thereby enlarging the contact surface area between fluid and separation material. Generally the fins are manufactured by metal sheets and connected to the walls by a metal-joining process. However the possible surface area enlargement is in the range of the surface area of the underlying metal sheets. In order to increase the surface area further on, without using more material, a metal <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> can be used as base material for fins instead of metal sheets. In addition fluid flow along textile structures experiences a very high heat transfer coefficient due to the repeating interruptions. New textile developments enable the fabrication of adapted structures with non-regular grid sizes purpose-built for gas-to-liquid heat exchanger application. A variety of <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> heat exchanger samples has been designed and manufactured. In this paper some design ideas and applications shall be presented. For performance evaluation the design ideas for gas-to-liquid heat exchangers are modelled within computational fluid dynamic software in order to get heat transfer coefficients and gas side pressure drop information. Thereby the velocity, pressure and temperature field within the <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> is calculated. Samples are tested for performance on a heat exchanger test facility, by using temperature controlled air on the gas side. The results are then used to compare <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> heat exchangers with finned heat exchangers available on the market.

40|$|Auxetic {{composites}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} and have demonstrated a high potential of applications in different areas due to their wonderful properties as compared to non-auxetic composites. In this study, a three-dimensional (3 D) auxetic <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> previously developed was used as reinforcement to fabricate auxetic composites with conventional polyurethane (PU) foam. Both the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the auxetic composites under compression were analyzed and compared with those of the pure PU foam and non-auxetic composites made with the same materials and structural parameters but with different yarn arrangement. The results show that the negative Poisson's ratio of composites can be obtained when suitable yarn arrangement in a 3 D <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> is adopted. The results also show that the auxetic composites and non-auxetic composites have different mechanical behaviors due to different yarn arrangements in 3 D <b>textile</b> <b>structure.</b> While the auxetic composites behave more like damping material with lower compression stress, the non-auxetic composite behaves more like stiffer material with higher compression stress. It is expected that this study could pave a way to the development of innovative 3 D auxetic textile composites for different potential applications such as impact protection.

40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} materials for buildings provide thermal energy cost savings, hence much attention is directed towards improving their performances {{and construction of}} new ones. Inorganic fibrous materials - stone and glass wool and organic foamy materials- expanded and extruded polystyrene are dominant on the European market. However, the EU priorities of creating products with improved ecological footprint have led towards research for developing new {{insulation materials}}. Evaluation {{of the performance of}} insulation materials is a multi-criteria problem, which has to be carried out with respect to: physical properties, health and environmental protection, applicability as building elements and their cost. Recycled textile waste has already found commercial application as insulation material but so far only waste that is easy to open down to fibers has been used. This paper proposes an alternative solution of a new <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> that will be used for thermal insulation of buildings’ internal walls in order to prevent the loss of a valuable resource, pre-consumer apparel cutting waste. The designed <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> is composed of polyester fabric apparel cutting waste which is shredded, rather than opened. Thermal conductivity - λ(W/mK) of the <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> was measured with the Heat flow meter FOX 600 instrument. The main goal was to determine the thermal insulation of the structure compared to the standard insulation structures, as well as textile insulating structures in form of fibers. The results of the 10 samples showed thermal conductivity coefficient (λ= 0, 052 - 0, 060 W/mK), comparable to the values of standard insulation materials (λ= 0, 030 - 0, 045 W/mK) and the values of insulation materials made from recycled textile fibers (λ= 0, 039 - 0, 041 W/mK). In addition to the economic benefits, production of this kind of insulation material will have an ecologic benefit by decreasing environmental pollution arising from polyester apparel cutting waste. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} smart {{flexible}} sensor adapted to <b>textile</b> <b>structures,</b> able to measure their strain deformations. The sensors are “smart ” because of their capacity to adapt to the specific mechanical properties of <b>textile</b> <b>structures</b> that are lightweight, highly flexible, stretchable, elastic, etc. Because of these properties, <b>textile</b> <b>structures</b> are continuously in movement and easily deformed, even under very low stresses. It is therefore important that the integration of a sensor does not modify their general behavior. The material used for the sensor is based on a thermoplastic elastomer (Evoprene) /carbon black nanoparticle composite, and presents general mechanical properties strongly compatible with the textile substrate. Two preparation techniques are investigated: the conventional melt-mixing process, and the solvent process which is found to be more adapted for this particular application. The preparation procedure is fully described, namely the optimization of the process in terms of filler concentration in which the percolation theory aspects have to be considered. The sensor is then integrated on a thin, lightweight Nylon fabric, and the electromechanical characterization is performed to demonstrate the adaptability and the correct functioning of the sensor as a strain gauge on the fabric. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} better predict the {{composite}} material behaviour, mechanical engineers need safe software tools to model the <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> and to integrate into simulating software {{by the use of}} finite element approach. Then, it’s necessary to have a clear description of the <b>textile</b> <b>structure</b> at each scale.

40|$|Conducting polymer-coated {{textiles}} {{possess a}} wide range of electrical properties. The surface resistivity is influenced by concentrations of the reactants, the thickness of the coating, the nature of the substrate surface, the extent of penetration of the polymer into the <b>textile</b> <b>structure,</b> and the strength of the binding of the coating to the textile surface. Low resistivity in fabric results from highly doped thicker coatings that penetrate well into the <b>textile</b> <b>structure,</b> thus enabling good electrical contact between fibers. Microwave studies showed that conductive textiles are not highly effective as electromagnetic shielding materials owing to their medium-level conductivity and therefore large skin depth. Combined with the fact that coatings are around 1. ?m thick, they cannot act as effective reflective barriers to electromagnetic radiation. However, because they are highly absorptive in the microwave region, absorbing materials can be designed in conjunction with conductive textiles. Study of Fourier transform-infrared spectra of aged polypyrrole films has shown an increase in intensity of an ?,?-unsaturated conjugated carbonyl peak that may be linked to the increase in resistance but cannot be the only factor, because the rate of electrical decay was influenced by several factors such as temperature, the type and concentration of the dopant, and the aging time, all of which signify a complex mechanism of degradation of conductivity.
