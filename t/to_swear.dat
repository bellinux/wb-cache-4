5|$|Béla was {{the oldest}} son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He {{was born in the}} second half of 1206. Upon King Andrew's initiative, Pope Innocent III had already appealed to the Hungarian prelates and barons on 7 June <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> an oath of loyalty to the King's future son.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> unconditional {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{concerns}} {{change and}} attitudes <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> among Englishmen. It includes two parts: The first part {{is about the}} underlying theory on swearing, such as why we swear, the history of <b>swearing</b> and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>swearing.</b> The second part is empirical, where I present my findings in my study. The study carried out was both qualitative and quantitative, as the methods included were questionnaires and interviews. The aim was to compare attitudes <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> between young, aged 20 - 30, and mature respondents, aged 60 plus, in York, England, and in addition compare these attitudes to findings in previous studies. My main hypothesis proposed that young respondents had more liberal attitudes <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> than the mature respondents, except {{when it came to}} racially abusive swearwords. The results suggested that this was indeed the case. Additionally, it was suggested by some of the female respondents that female swearing is becoming more similar <b>to</b> male <b>swearing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Most {{clinical}} nurses regularly have to {{deal with}} offensive language, including swearing. Of the growing body of literature on the extent of verbal aggression within healthcare settings little relates <b>to</b> <b>swearing,</b> and even less to its legal aspects which may affect nurses. Graduates often feel ill-prepared to deal with this behaviour, and policy and law with regard <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> and offensive language remain vague. Aim: In order to familiarise nurses with the legal position, this paper will explain the law as it relates <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> and offensive language, with particular attention to the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW); case law, legislation and the Zero Tolerance Policy. Finally there will be a discussion of the management of offensive language in Australian health care settings. Conclusion: Research is needed to identify and evaluate interventions <b>to</b> deal with <b>swearing</b> within a healthcare setting...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Ewondo lands {{came under}} the {{administration}} of the French Third Republic under a League of Nations mandate. Atangana, now known by the French version of his name, Charles, wrote the French government <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> his allegiance and demand readmittance to his homeland. He received his wish in June 1920 and arrived in Douala on 28 November 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year (358 BC), Philip {{heard that the}} Paionian king, Agis, had died. Taking advantage of their political disarray and transition of power, Philip marched his army into Paionia, where he defeated the Paionians. He then compelled the tribe <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> allegiance to Macedon.|$|E
5|$|British {{relations}} were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French {{leaders such as}} Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for his}} son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{presiding}} over the conversions of Muslims in his wife's Castilian lands, Ferdinand II did not extend the conversions to his Aragonese subject. Kings of Aragon, including Ferdinand, were required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> an oath of coronation to not forcibly convert their Muslim subjects. He repeated the same oath to his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life he was unwilling to break it. Ferdinand died in 1516, and was succeeded by his grandson Charles V, who also swore the same oath at his coronation.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's army seized Visegrád, Vác, Pest, Tata and Székesfehérvár in October, {{but could}} not capture Buda. His {{military}} commander, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, again laid siege to Buda on 4May 1541. Suleiman left Istanbul {{at the head of}} a large army in June to take advantage of the new civil war in Hungary. On his command, Petru Rareș, Prince of Moldavia, captured Stephen Majláth and forced the Transylvanian Diet <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> fealty to John Sigismund in late July. Roggendorf lifted the siege of Buda before Suleiman reached the town on 26August.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} King had only insisted on that oath {{to protect the}} {{stability}} of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|His career {{stalled in}} the 1970s because he refused <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> {{allegiance}} to the Romanian Communist Party and was forced out of academia for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of Science of Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands drew him international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> an oath of allegiance to her.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1158, {{during the reign of}} Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince Raynald of Châtillon <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> fealty to him in {{punishment}} for Raynald's attack on Byzantine Cyprus. The Greek Patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin Patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald's capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine vassal state until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel's death in 1180 hindered the Empire's ability to enforce its claim.|$|E
5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome {{and acknowledged}} the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, was present when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> {{an oath to}} accept Raymund-Roupen's right to inherit Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.|$|E
40|$|Swearing {{acceptance}} as {{a function}} of media and family influences was examined among 763 college students from a large southeastern public research university. Participants completed an online questionnaire and answered a series of questions related to their personality characteristics, religiosity, and swearing histories and attitudes. Participants reported being most frequently exposed <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> from their mothers followed by media sources. Swearing acceptance varied {{as a function}} of the Big Five personality characteristics as well as religiosity. The extent to which media and family influences related <b>to</b> <b>swearing</b> acceptance through potential mediating factors of personality characteristics and religiosity was assessed with structural equation modeling. Overall, the model was able to explain some of the relationship between media and family influences and the swearing acceptance of participants...|$|R

5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} were required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required {{of members of}} the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E

On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty's election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of Alexandria put more trust in Rick's group {{to protect the}} town better.
