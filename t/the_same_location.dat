5|$|After his {{position}} as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured, Al-Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the citadel.

The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and build {{one of the large}} towers of the citadel. Several of Al-Adil's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the citadel, including residences, palaces, and a pool. As-Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also modified the defences.|$|E
