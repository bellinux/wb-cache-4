5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having <b>the</b> <b>insights</b> of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, {{in part because of the}} reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and <b>the</b> <b>Insight</b> platform is <b>the</b> position of the fuel tank.

5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt {{that it did not}} contain <b>the</b> <b>insights</b> about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage <b>the</b> <b>insights</b> of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{introduced}} the Latin script, {{which was used}} to record {{a large body of}} Aztec prose, poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments, administrative documents, legal letters, etc. In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet. No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl, and no general consensus has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish, such as long vowels and the glottal stop. The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Horacio Carochi, building on <b>the</b> <b>insights</b> of another Jesuit, Antonio del Rincon. Carochi's orthography used two different diacritics: a macron to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo, and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels. This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of the Jesuit community.|$|E

Meeting the performance requirements of the SEIS instrument is vital to successfully achieve these mission objectives.

Lander mechanical noise maps that will be used to select the best deployment site for SEIS once <b>the</b> <b>InSight</b> lander arrives on Mars are also presented. We find the lander mechanical noise may be a detectable signal on <b>the</b> <b>InSight</b> seismometers. However, for the baseline SEIS deployment position, the noise is expected to be below the total noise requirement > 97 % of the time and is, therefore, not expected to endanger <b>the</b> <b>InSight</b> mission objectives...|$|R
