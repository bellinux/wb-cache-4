5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} {{in the end zone}} for what looked like a game-winning touchdown. However, referee Gene Steratore ruled <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> incomplete, saying that Johnson had not maintained possession of the ball through the entire process of <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> The Lions lost the game by a score of 1914.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{returned}} with the second new ball after lunch to remove Tom Dollery with another yorker, leaving England at 4/97. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook’s in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston’s variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. Late in the day, Johnston took <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> as Lindwall removed Evans, who had taken a wild slash to leave England at 7/216. In the final minutes of play, Johnston extracted an edge from Compton on 64, but Tallon dropped <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> On the second morning, Tallon dropped Comptonthen on 73for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston, who eventually ended the England innings on 363 by removing Young. Compton had added a further 81 after being dropped from Johnston's bowling to end unbeaten on 145. Johnston had bowled the most overs of the Australians and been the most economical.|$|E

5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's head on the full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E

5|$|England batted for {{the second}} time, and after lunch on the fourth afternoon, Bradman set fields to {{restrict}} the scoring, as England passed 100 without loss. Washbrook then hooked Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> He repeated the shot soon after and Harvey took <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> at 1/129, so the Australian captain's miss cost little. Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 2/129. During most of the afternoon, Bradman used a strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field for Johnson, who had been repeatedly attacked by the batsmen. England then reached 8/362 at the close, a lead of 400. England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. As the batting team is allowed to choose which (if any) roller can be used {{at the start of}} the day's play, this ploy allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia in order to make the batting conditions harder for England. At the start of any innings, the batting captain also has the choice of having the pitch rolled. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would disadvantage his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} <b>the</b> <b>catch</b> as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E

5|$|Further delay meant play {{began after}} the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia not looking to chase the runs because the time {{available}} was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed <b>the</b> <b>catch.</b> Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.|$|E
