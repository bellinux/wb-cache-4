Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem.

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no evidence of homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I {{was going to be like}} mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E
500|$|The Blu-ray {{version was}} {{released}} on 2 December 2008. It contains audio in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai, and subtitles in 10 languages. Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk also criticized the film, yet praised the Blu-ray release, rating it 4½ [...] stars out of 5 for its video quality and 4 out of 5 for its audio, though only giving it 1½ stars for its extras, noting the lack of special features. A review from Blu-Ray.com also gave a favourable review of both the audio and visual quality, stating [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much here one could be dissatisfied with." [...] High-Def Digest, however, gave a more negative review. Whilst praising the audio quality, the lack of special features was criticized, as was the video quality, which was described as being [...] "smothered" [...] with edge enhancement. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Sony is practically begging people not to buy it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta and his {{government}} were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that [...] "it is naive to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West {{and would like to}} serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa is ripe for revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E

500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired {{by the fact that the}} banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Spectator in 1869 concurred with Stott's opinion, writing [...] "Mr Dickens {{has brought}} people to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a sort of}} piety in being gushing and maudlin," [...] and that his works are heavily imbued with the [...] "most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism", but the {{unsigned}} critic still maintained that Dickens {{was one of the}} great authors of his time.|$|E

He said, [...] "A lot {{of people}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true." [...] He further {{expressed}} concern that Trump's reckless behavior could lead to war. [...] Criticisms of a president from in a senator's own party are rare.

However, van Inwagen’s version of the problem can <b>be</b> avoided if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> true propositions taking the form of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> good reasons to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are,</b> and no comparably good reasons to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> not. This defense is also resistant to common attacks based on foreknowledge and the grounding of the truth of these counterfactuals...|$|R
2500|$|Penrose is an atheist. In {{the film}} A Brief History of Time, he said, [...] "I think I {{would say that}} the {{universe}} has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along – it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful {{way of looking at the}} universe, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something much deeper about it."

2500|$|In {{their early}} years, Depeche Mode were {{considered}} teen idols, and regularly featured on front covers of magazines such as Smash Hits. Following {{the departure of}} Vince Clarke, their music began {{to take on a}} darker tone akin to that found in gothic rock, as Martin Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore's lyrical artistry has been recognised as encapsulating themes such as sex, religion, and politics, so much so that many labelled the band's lyrical and musical themes as dark and bleak. In response, Gore has stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness present more of a realistic character and are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds [...] "happy songs" [...] fake and unrealistic: [...] "I've never seen our music as being over-dark. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always an element of hope in our music." ...|$|E

Diệm then asked Lodge to talk to officials in Washington about Nhu's future; Diệm was still refusing to remove his brother from authority. He said [...] "Please tell President Kennedy I am a good and frank ally, that I would rather be frank and settle questions than talk about them after we have lost everything. Tell President Kennedy that I take all his suggestions very seriously and wish to carry them out but it is a question of timing." [...] Lodge did not discuss anything specific with regards to a regime change, but claimed that he was not worried by rumors that Diệm and Nhu had wanted to assassinate him. Lodge expressed his [...] "admiration and personal friendship" [...] and gratitude for Diệm's hospitality.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy {{that he be}} given {{a copy of the}} Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church Of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool. Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on Dateline NBC, Dahmer had stated: [...] "If a person doesn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges?

2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J.

The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's all alone {{in the woods with}} Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
