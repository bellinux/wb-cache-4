5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} two diagnostic tools used {{to determine}} if counterfactual analysis requires extrapolation. Counterfactuals based on extrapolation are model dependent and might not support empirically valid inferences. <b>The</b> <b>diagnostics</b> help researchers identify those counterfactual “what if” questions that are empirically plausible. We show, through simple Monte Carlo experiments, that these diagnostics will often detect extrapolation, suggesting {{that there is a}} risk of biased counterfactual inference when there is no such risk of extrapolation bias in the data. This is because <b>the</b> <b>diagnostics</b> are affected by what we call the n/k problem: as the number of data points relative to the number of explanatory variables decreases, <b>the</b> <b>diagnostics</b> are more likely to detect the risk of extrapolation bias even when such risk does not exist. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>diagnostics</b> provide too severe a test for many data sets used in political science...|$|R

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between <b>the</b> <b>diagnostic</b> criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>diagnostic</b> utility of {{measuring}} uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder.

This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
