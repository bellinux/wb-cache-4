5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E

25|$|The Rev. Mr. Hackwell is a Protestant {{minister}} who uses his religious influence {{for his own}} benefit. During one of his sermons, he publicly alludes to Dr. Norval. He knows that Mrs. Norval recognizes his authority, and he capitalizes on this {{in order to increase}} his own wealth. His insatiable greed reveals him to be a schemer rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of integrity. In her description of this dissolute minister, Ruiz de Burton parodies New England religious life.|$|E
25|$|An October 2012 {{study by}} the American Association of University Women found that {{over the course of}} a 35-year career, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2million less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with the same education. Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a {{stimulus}} effect that would grow the U.S. economy by at least 3% to 4%. Women currently make up 70 percent of Medicaid recipients and 80 percent of welfare recipients. Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.|$|E
25|$|Wilberforce had a {{track record}} against {{evolution}} {{as far back as}} the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' Vestiges. For the more challenging task of opposing the Origin, and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen– Owen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his Quarterly Review article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.|$|E

The episode earned a Nielsen {{household}} rating of 8.2, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 8.2% of the nation's estimated households.

The episode subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on July 28, 2002.

500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the single most important and influential editor in the early history of science fiction. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: [...] "More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf." [...] After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including [...] "Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> but not like a man"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have seen}} Jake as an {{ambiguous}} representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, {{in the bar}} scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he is less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women. Hemingway's writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but {{then goes on to}} say, [...] "I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot." ...|$|E

500|$|Longchamp died in January 1197, at Poitiers, {{while on}} a {{diplomatic}} mission to Rome for Richard, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that [...] "monster with many heads". The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so {{at the urging of}} the English bishops. When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were [...] "men of no little virtue and fame". Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp's [...] "record of his life in politics and administration was a good one, spoiled only by his failure in 1191".|$|E
500|$|The Church of England's {{response}} was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection {{as an instrument}} of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as [...] "just as noble a conception of Deity". In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin, with its ideas including higher criticism attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God's laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised [...] "Mr Darwin's masterly volume [...] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature". Asa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology. The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley's legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film any more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, {{on the day of}} release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
