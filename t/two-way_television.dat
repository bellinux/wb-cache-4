25|$|The {{addition}} of regional offices {{and resulted in}} the microwave radio relay being upgraded in the 1970s. The Telecommunications Administration insisted on continuing using analog transmission, while NRK instead wanted to implement a digital transmission. NRK got its way, and a transistor-based system with a capacity corresponding to 960 telephone lines was installed. The resulting system had two radio channels, one for transmitting radio from Oslo to the regional offices and one for transmission between the regional offices. The FM transmitters were fed their programs from the regional offices. The system had a <b>two-way</b> <b>television</b> channel, which could feed the television programs to the transmitters and allow for transfer of program content from the regional offices to Oslo. The sound transfer system had four 2-megabit channels; the one was used for 30 telephone lines {{and the other was}} used for 5 program channels. These had a sampling rate of 32kHz and a 14-bit bit rate, which was reduced to 11 through compression. No other available systems could produce this quality of audio.|$|E

Slater writes that Orwell desired to show through the Party's unrealistic politics that modern authoritarianism was growing more lustful of power for power's sake.

This could be achieved through technological breakthroughs, such as the telescreen, a <b>two-way</b> <b>television</b> that allows continuous government espionage of the population.

40|$|When {{evaluating}} alternative {{designs of}} subscriber terminals {{that have been}} proposed for <b>two-way</b> cable <b>television</b> (CATV) systems we need to use {{political as well as}} economic criteria. The political objective a two-way communication system should serve is making government more responsive to feedback from citizens. At the national and state level this means better education about public issues and more effective exchange of information between citizens and their representatives. At the community level this means helping the discussion of public issues, aiding community decision-making, and connecting members of the community with their officials. At the group level this means helping improve decision-making and helping new groups to form and express new interests. Subscriber terminals that have been proposed for CATV systems vary widely, from a simple four-button pad to a full keyboard and printer with display screen and microphone.

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{three types of}} {{transmission}} technology in distance education are compared, and the costs for equipping and installing a distance education classroom are estimated. Two of the technologies [...] fiber optics and microwave [...] deliver two-way, full motion video and two-way audio. The third technology, compressed video, also delivers two-way audio and two-way video, but uses a computer device to compress the signal. Data about costs were collected through interviews with suppliers, users, and technical experts. If full motion video is essential, microwave is the most viable solution for shorter distances. Digital fiber is the best choice as far as quality and capacity are concerned, but high costs tend to negate advantages. Fiber is the most complex to install, and consequently very expensive. If compressed video is satisfactory for the situation, it is the least expensive alternative to install and remains cost-appropriate for longer distances. The standard classroom can be easily adapted for distance education without significant remodeling. A distance education classroom can be equipped for less than 30, 000 dollars. <b>Two-way</b> interactive <b>television</b> is expensive to design and install, but neither complex nor difficult to use.
