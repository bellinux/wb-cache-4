40|$|Although {{patronage}} {{politics in}} democracies {{has been studied}} extensively, it is less understood in undemocratic regimes, where {{a large proportion of}} the world's population resides. To fill this gap, our paper studies how government officials in authoritarian Vietnam direct public resources toward <b>their</b> <b>hometowns.</b> We manually collect an exhaustive panel dataset of political promotions of officials from 2000 to 2010 and estimate their impact on public infrastructure in <b>their</b> rural <b>hometowns.</b> We obtain three main results. First, promotions of officials improve a wide range of infrastructure in <b>their</b> <b>hometowns,</b> including roads, markets, schools, radio stations, clean water and irrigation. This favoritism is pervasive among officials across different ranks, even among those without budget authority, suggesting informal channels of influence. Second, in contrast to pork-barrel politics in democratic parliaments, elected legislators have no power to exercise favoritism. Third, only home communes receive favors, while larger and more politically important home districts do not. This suggests that favoritism is likely motivated by officials’ social preferences for <b>their</b> <b>hometowns</b> rather than by political considerations...|$|R
