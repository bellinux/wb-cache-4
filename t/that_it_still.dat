5|$|In March 1935, Chadwick {{received}} {{an offer of}} the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.|$|E

Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E

25|$|By 27 July 1941, Anti-tank Battalion 529 {{had lost}} four Panzerjäger I's.

Most {{do not appear}} to have survived the Winter of 1941–42 as Anti-tank Battalion 521 reported only five on hand on 5 May 1942. Anti-tank Battalion 529 had only two on strength when it was disbanded on 30 June 1942. Anti-tank Battalion 616 seems to have been an exception as it reported all three companies had Panzerjäger I's through at least the fall of 1942.|$|E

25|$|Although {{slavery in}} Europe died out {{before it was}} {{abolished}} in the Western Hemisphere, as late as 1776 slavery had not yet died out all across the continent when Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> existed in some eastern regions.

The slavery of North Africa and the Middle East, over the centuries, took more slaves from sub-Saharan Africa than the Western Hemisphere did… But these remained largely poor countries until the discovery and extraction of their vast oil deposits.|$|E

Hoboken Terminal was also one of the first stations in the world to employ the Bush-type train shed, designed by and named for Lincoln Bush of the DL, which quickly became ubiquitous in station design. The station is unusual for a New York City area commuter railroad terminal in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> has low-level platforms, requiring passengers to use stairs on the train to board and alight.|$|E

25|$|BBC Radio 1 is a British {{radio station}} {{operated}} by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It was launched in 1967 {{to meet the demand}} for music generated by pirate radio stations, when {{the average age of the}} UK population was 27. Recently, the BBC claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> targets the 15–29 age group, although the average age of its UK audience in 2008 had risen to 33.

25|$|That the {{government}} still displays such heightened sensitivities around the Cultural Revolution is an indicator <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> considers itself, {{at least in}} part, an inheritor of its legacy. The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the Tiananmen crackdown on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government {{has no interest in}} re-evaluating any issue that might lead to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.|$|E
25|$|After the conquest, King Henry IV of Castile {{assumed the}} {{additional}} title of King of Gibraltar, establishing {{it as part}} of the comarca of the Campo Llano de Gibraltar.

In 1501, Gibraltar passed back to the Spanish Crown, and Isabella I of Castile issued a Royal Warrant granting Gibraltar the coat of arms <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> uses today.|$|E

25|$|A {{legal service}} starts a rally, {{in which the}} players {{alternate}} hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> falls in the server's court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return {{as long as it}} crosses into {{the opposite side of the}} court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.|$|E
25|$|Some kibbutzim {{have been}} {{involved}} in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz Glil Yam, near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatization. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz Beit Oren applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of cooperative societies to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of cooperative society. The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>still</b> maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.|$|E
