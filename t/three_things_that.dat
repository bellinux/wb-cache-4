The film begins with Keesey discussing the <b>three</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the charity focuses on, which are to [...] "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." [...] He {{also points out that}} [...] "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", {{as a part of the}} group's management expenses, along with going toward [...] "thousands of free screenings of the group’s films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord’s Resistance Army... to speak at these events." [...] Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with [...] "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" [...] going toward [...] "'program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause", and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via Twitter, using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything. Two further short videos featured LRA survivors expressing support for the film and the organization.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the Obama presidency, {{particularly}} during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton. A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn. On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea. A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving. On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, [...] "There are <b>three</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you." [...] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to [...] "impact {{as many people as possible}} in an unbiased way." ...|$|E

[...] When one of the choppers breaks down in Southern Utah, Larry is shown performing his mechanical skills on the bike in a supermarket parking lot (when his own bike has magneto problems, Larry explains to the camera, [...] "If the bike is not running; if it's leaking oil; and if it's dirty.

[...] " [...] {{found that it was}} <b>three</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> brought that about. One was racial hysteria, second was war hysteria and third was failure of political leadership. Donald Trump is the perfect example of that failure.... What Donald Trump is talking about is something that's going to make his logo 'America disgraced again.'" [...] During the transition following Trump's election, Carl Higbie cited the internment of Japanese Americans as a historical precedent for a register of Muslims. [...] Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Trump advisor on immigration matters to Trump, was reportedly proposing the register as the first priority in a suite of proposals for the Department of Homeland Security and as part of the [...] "extreme vetting" [...] of immigrants. [...] Takei quickly described Higbie's comments as [...] "dangerous" [...] and went on to say on The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell that [...] "egistration of any group of people, and certainly registration of Muslims, is a prelude to internment." [...] Takei was not alone in his criticisms, Higbie also attracted criticism in the Washington Post, The New York Times, from Megyn Kelly of Fox News, and from Representative Judy Chu (DCA), who denounced them as [...] "abhorent" [...] idea [...] "based on tactics of fear, division, and hate." [...] The constitutional basis of Higbie's idea was also challenged, even though the Supreme Court has not explicitly overturned Korematsu. Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein has argued that Korematsu has [...] "joined Dred Scott as an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry," [...] while Noah Feldman has declared that [...] "Korematsus uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned." [...] President-elect Trump’s transition team have since issued a statement to The Huffington Post denying that Trump supports a Muslim registry. [...] This claim contradicts statements Trump made in 2015, including those which Takei denounced, and the newspaper noted that video evidence of Trump's statements is available.|$|E
