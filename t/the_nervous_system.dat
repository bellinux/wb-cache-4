5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of <b>the</b> <b>Nervous</b> <b>System</b> examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> during 1938. Neuroscience {{during the twentieth century}} began to be recognized as a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{peripheral}} <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{is divided}} into <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> and <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is under voluntary control, and transmits signals from the brain to end organs such as muscles. <b>The</b> sensory <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is part of <b>the</b> somatic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and transmits signals from senses such as taste and touch (including fine touch and gross touch) to the spinal cord and brain. <b>The</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is a 'self-regulating' system which influences the function of organs outside of voluntary control, such as the heart rate, or {{the functions of the}} digestive system.|$|R

5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E

50|$|Acetylcholine has {{functions}} both in <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (PNS) and in <b>the</b> central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (CNS). In <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> acetylcholine activates muscles, {{and is a}} major neurotransmitter in <b>the</b> autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> In <b>the</b> CNS, cholinergic projections {{from the}} basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus support the cognitive functions of those target areas.|$|R
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. <b>The</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals.

This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of <b>the</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
