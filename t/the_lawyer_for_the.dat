Following the outbreak of World WarI, Zimmerman registered for the draft during the registration for men aged 18 through 45 under the Selective Service Act of 1917. After the Winchester and Western Railroad Company received its charter on August 31, 1916, to build and operate a rail line connecting Wardensville and the Lost River valley of West Virginia to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Winchester, Virginia, Zimmerman served as the company's secretary.|$|E

25|$|His most salacious {{case was}} {{his defense of}} Jeff and Kathy Willets in 1991. The Willets were accused of {{operating}} a sex business out of their home. Rubin argued in their defense that Kathy Willets was driven to prostitution by nymphomania brought on by side-effects of the antidepressant, Prozac, forcing her to need sex {{with as many as}} eight men daily. Her husband, a deputy sheriff, was impotent and videotaped his wife's sex acts as a form of therapy. Despite this original defense, both were convicted. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prosecution was Joel T. Lazarus, who shortly afterward was appointed a judge.|$|E

Out of the resulting report, the Hawke government drew four main proposals, which were put {{to the people of}} Australia as referendums later in the year. Of the four referendum questions proposed, one, titled Fair Elections, included a proposal to remove section 41, {{and replace it with a}} clear guarantee of the right to vote. However, the referendum failed, attracting only 37.59% support nationally.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Manitoba Justice Minister James McCrae {{appointed}} Hughes to lead {{an investigation}} into the unusual circumstances which led to lawyer Harvey Pollock being arrested on a dubious sexual assault charge. Pollock had previously acted as <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family of J.J. Harper, an indigenous leader who had been killed in a confrontation with Winnipeg police. The case against Pollock quickly fell apart in court, and the woman whose statements led to the charge later clarified that she had never accused Pollock of sexual assault during her discussions with police. Pollock believed that he was the target of a police vendetta. Hughes' report completely vindicated Pollock and led to the resignation of police chief Herb Stephen.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of anarchism {{was also a}} point of contention during the trial. Gordon Simmons, an adjunct professor of philosophy at West Virginia State University and Marshall University, testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, {{and the notion that}} anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the Haymarket affair and Sacco and Vanzetti. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to terrorism and assassination, and referred to Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski as anarchists. On July 12, the court ruled that Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the T-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club, and awarded her the $1 in damages she sought. Attorneys for both Kanawha County and Sierra asked that those parts of the verdict that went against their client, requesting that Kanawha Chief Circuit Judge James C. Stucky throw out the jury's verdict, finding it to be inconsistent, and that he rule himself instead.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 6 July at 3:30am, 1,500 {{soldiers}} and riot police {{swept into the}} nationalist area in 100 armoured vehicles. They took control of Garvaghy Road {{so it would be}} free for the marchers. This led to clashes with about 300 protesters, who began a sit-down protest on the road. They were forcibly removed by riot police. Rosemary Nelson, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> residents coalition, was verbally and physically abused by officers. Some officers claimed that residents taunted them about the killing of their two colleagues in Lurgan while shouting IRA slogans. From this point onward, the road was sealed off by rows of armoured vehicles and residents were hemmed into their housing estates. As residents were unable to reach the Catholic , the local priests held an open-air mass in front of a line of {{soldiers and}} armoured personnel carriers. Ronnie Flanagan, the Chief Constable, said the march had been allowed to go ahead to avoid loyalist violence. The parade marched along Garvaghy Road at noon that day. After it passed, the security forces began withdrawing from the area and severe rioting erupted. They were attacked by hundreds of nationalists with stones, bricks and petrol bombs. About 40 plastic bullets were fired at rioters, and about 18 people had to be hospitalised.|$|E

Allen was reluctant to write about Capote at first, but once she had researched him, she found {{the last ten years}} of his life not as off-putting as she had thought: [...] "Capote had a kind of Gallantry {{in the face of a}} devastating situation." [...] Friends of Capote were amazed at her accuracy portraying a man she had only met but not known, and there was much question about how many of the lines are Capote's and how many Allen's; she maintained that at least 70% of the dialogue is Capote's own.|$|E
2500|$|Darrow {{entered the}} racially charged {{atmosphere}} as <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defendants. Darrow reconstructed {{the case as}} a justified honor killing by Thomas Massie. Considered by The New York Times {{to be one of}} Darrow's three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of white America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter. As to Darrow's closing, one juror commented, [...] "e talked to us like a bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here." [...] Governor Lawrence Judd later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office. Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Massie was found [...] "not Guilty" [...] in a posthumous trial.|$|E

The {{executive director of the}} North Carolina chapter of the ACLU, Jennifer Rudinger, said [...] "it would be very difficult for a person wishing to swear on a non-Christian text to halt a courtroom proceeding to pursue a legal challenge on the issue". Mateen said [...] "Had I known that it would be taken to this point, I wouldn't have affirmed. I could have postponed everything until they got some Qurans." [...] The ACLU was also surprised that Judge Smith cited [...] "lack of an actual controversy" [...] as a reason for dismissal because Grady Balentine, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state attorney general's office, did not make that argument. Balentine had only argued [...] "that the law gives people another option if they don't wish to swear on the Christian Bible".|$|E

Moreover, the Palestinian families and their supporters maintained that Ottoman documents that Israel's Supreme Court had validated were in fact forgeries, and that the original ruling and therefore evictions relating to that ruling should be reversed. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Israeli families emphasized that the land deeds were authentic, according to many Israeli courts The Israeli court decision (resulting in the aforementioned evictions) stated that the document presented by the Palestinian families was a forgery, while the document of Jewish ownership was authentic.|$|E

The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying [...] "It's time, people, {{to wake up and}} shape up and say this is our country, white people, take it back." [...] The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, [...] "The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable." [...] Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done.|$|E
