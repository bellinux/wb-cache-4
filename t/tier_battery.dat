40|$|ATAK-S is a newly {{developed}} native hybrid layer. Although the laying performance of this hybrid {{has been studied}} and determined, the performance response of the hybrid to different environmental temperature conditions is not known. This study was therefore undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of cold and heat stress on egg quality traits. Hens were divided into three different groups; control (20 °C), low (12 °C) and high (32 °C). A total of 360 hens, with 120 in each of the groups, were used in the study. Hens were held in three <b>tier</b> <b>battery</b> cages in an environmentally controlled poultry house. The study lasted for 3 weeks. No differences were found among different groups in terms of shape index, albumen height and Haugh unit of the egg quality traits. It was found that the differences among the heat groups in terms of egg shell breaking strength, egg weight, shell thickness and yolk colour were significant and the value of these traits decreased under the heat stress conditions, whereas they were not affected from the cold stress.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} to indicate that: a) The cuticular layer of the shell is rarely present as an even covering at any stage in the laying year. So, {{its role as a}} first line of defence is questionable. b) The shell membranes do inhibit bacterial transfer to some degree, even when they are structurally disrupted; however, if the challenge is great enough, then their function as effective barriers is reduced. c) In the absence of the shell membranes, Salmonella enteritidis Phage type 4 does not move freely across the shell, but it is either facilitated or inhibited in its passage by structural variation in the true shell, particularly {{at the level of the}} mammillary layer. Statistical data support in most instances a significant and positive correlation between the presence of structural defects and bacterial transfer. d) In a three <b>tier</b> <b>battery</b> system, a tier effect exists with respect to ease of translocation of microoganisms, with eggs from the top tier being more susceptible, i. e. structurally inferior. e) The results confirm earlier work that shell quality declines with age, and extends this finding to show that this morphological deterioration is accompanied by a decreased resistance to bacterial movement. f) Patent gas exchange pores, whilst obvious portals for bacterial ingress, are in this respect of secondary importance to structural defects within the shell. Evidence is also provided to substantiate the assumption that birds, irrespective of strain, display diverse shell structural quality. One of the strains evaluated (strain B) was structurally better than the other (strain A), at the beginning and middle of lay, and was also more capable of withstanding bacterial challenge in all three laying periods tested. 4. The housing system can influence shell quality; thus Barn and Battery eggs were structurally superior to their Range counterparts, at the end of lay. 5. The tagging of Salmonella with immunogold markers proved to be a valuable technique, which allowed a more precise localisation of the bacteria within the shell's ultrastructure, as viewed by the Scanning Electron Microscope (S. E. M.). This method gave support to other findings in this work, confirming that bacterial transfer was specifically encouraged by late fusion and alignment of the mammillae and pitting occurrences, with the cone layer probably implicated in the process of penetration in vivo.

40|$|During {{the last}} 40 years, studies {{incorporating}} in vitro methodologies have greatly advanced {{our understanding of}} human nerve cell biology. Attempts {{have been made to}} apply these to investigations of neurotoxicity. Due to the complexity of the nervous system, underpinned by an array of integrated interactions between a host of cell types, it is concluded that, at present, alternative neural models are most successful in determining the underlying mechanisms which can cause perturbation of normal functioning of the nervous system, both in adults and during the embryonic period. The use of <b>tiered</b> <b>batteries</b> of test models has been proposed in screening programmes for neurotoxicity, with the generation of much encouraging data in laboratories across the globe. This review aims to discuss the development of neural alternatives, considers the various model systems available, and highlights specific neuronal endpoints which can be tested, in addition to the cytotoxic evaluation of neuronal viability. Developments in molecular and stem cell biology, which are appropriate to neural tissue, and which offer the prospect of exciting advances for the next decade, are cited...|$|R

Such testing batteries could be also applied for mixture assessment and in combination with effect-directed analysis to identify neurotoxic pollutants in the environment.|$|R
40|$|Today {{ecotoxicological}} {{evaluations of}} surface water quality are either based on field surveys or online biomonitoring, whereas the ecotoxicological quality of wastewater is mostly determined with standardised acute toxicity tests. In this paper {{we present a}} concept for the ecotoxicological evaluation of surface waters, where mainly in vitro tests are used for the screening of water samples, presenting the first tier of a two-tiered approach. In this first <b>tier</b> a <b>battery</b> of fast and cost-efficient test systems are used as an early warning system. Thereby, the toxic potential of water samples will be identified. This modular approach allows the exchange or addition of test systems if necessary. If a toxic potential is identified in a water sample, this sample can be investigated more thoroughly in a second tier where organisms are used. In this paper we focus mainly on the general approach and {{the description of the}} first tier...|$|R
2500|$|Death feigning {{behaviour}} can be deliberately {{induced by}} humans, a prominent example being the [...] "hypnosis" [...] of chickens or pigeons. For example, if a pigeon is grasped firmly, quickly inverted and held briefly {{on its back}} on a table, it often remains immobile {{for a minute or}} two. According to Gilman et al. the investigation of 'animal hypnosis' dates back to the year 1646 in a report by Kircher. It has been shown that the intensity and duration of death feigning is related to the intensity of fear prior to the feigning state being induced. This has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens, hens on the top <b>tier</b> of <b>battery</b> cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels, hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor, and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{electrical}} engineering capstone project, Dynamic Positioning 2 (DP 2), is to prototype a controlled dynamic positioning system that has a single-failure safe capability. The primary objective is for the platform to maintain a desired heading and position within ten degrees and three hundred millimeters, respectively, using data obtained from three {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) sensors. The secondary objective is for the control system to compensate for the failure of a single sensor or motor. The platform for the DP 2 project is a salvage drum that encases the electronic equipment and an inner tube for buoyancy. The internal construction consists of three <b>tiers</b> containing <b>batteries</b> at the lowest level, an onboard computer at the second level, and control hardware at the top level. The platform is tested in an indoor tank with an area of sixteen meters squared. The vessel’s position is calculated from the LIDAR data (bearing and range) to eight stationary poles that mark the outside of the tank using an overdetermined least squares matrix solution. The heading is calculated using the bearings and ranges to specific pairs of poles. An ad-hoc wireless network is used to communicate with the onboard computer while it is operating. All programming was completed in the NET Framework and MATLAB®. Students complete the project milestones through the application of material from past courses in computer control systems, software engineering, and electronic navigation at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy. The DP 2 project is sponsored by the Marine Safety Center (MSC) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if the response to different sources of Met was influenced by {{the presence or absence of}} antibiotics and antibacterials that might alter intestinal microflora. A Met-deficient diet (0. 33 % by analysis), based on corn and soybean meal, was fed with or without a mixture providing 200 g/ton of bacitracin methylene disalicylate, 200 g/ton of chlortetracycline, 100 g/ton of penicillin, and 100 g/ton of sulfaquinoxaline. Diets were fortified with DL-Met or the liquid form of 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylbutanoic acid (HMB) to provide supplemental levels of Met ranging from 0. 0 to 0. 20 % in increments of 0. 04 %, based on 99 % activity for DL-Met and 88 % activity for HMB. The experimental treatments consisted of a 2 × 2 × 6 factorial arrangement of treatments with 2 diet types (medicated and unmedicated), 2 Met sources (DL-Met and HMB) at 6 levels of supplementation for a total of 24 dietary treatments. Each of these was fed to 6 replicate pens of 5 male chicks from 0 to 21 d, stratified across <b>tiers</b> in the <b>battery.</b> Feeding the medicated diets resulted in a significant reduction in intestinal bacterial as measured by total aerobic plate count of ileal contents, with significant improvements in BW and feed conversion. However, there were no significant interactions between the medications and the response to the 2 sources of Met. There was no difference in BW or feed conversion related to th...|$|R
40|$|The United States Coast Guard is {{responsible}} for enforcing Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) standards in the maritime industry. It {{is important for the}} members of the U. S. Coast Guard to understand how these systems work. Students have gained a much greater understanding of how DPS platforms work and what might be required to maintain them by building one from scratch. Aside from this, the project has served as a great opportunity to work on a one year term project that may resemble engineering or acquisitions projects that might be encountered in the students’ future careers. The overall goal of the Robust Dynamic Positioning and Data Acquisition System project was to prototype a dynamic positioning system similar to the ones on buoy tenders in the fleet. The primary goal was to maintain a desired heading and position within a certain range. The secondary goals included robust capabilities (the ability to continue functioning despite motor failures) and data acquisition (to analyze system performance post-testing). Students built a vessel from scratch out of a salvage drum and an inner tube for buoyancy. The internal construction consists of three <b>tiers</b> containing <b>batteries</b> at the lowest level, an onboard computer at the second level, and control hardware at the top level (micro controllers, H-bridges, and fuse boxes). Students successfully used a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) device to determine the relative position to two stationary poles. They were able to communicate with the onboard computer via either a wired connection or a remote desktop connection through an ad-hoc wireless network. All programming for this project was done in MATLAB®. Students have completed all project milestones through the application of past courses they have taken in computer control systems, network communication, and digital signal processing at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy. The first challenge of this project was to focus on constructing the vessel and installing the control hardware. One of the obstacles for the students was establishing communication between the various pieces of software, hardware, and the power distribution system. The LIDAR sensor determined the vessel’s relative position and heading to two stationary poles. Using the position and heading resolution algorithms, students conducted a set of system identification tests in an indoor tank to determine how the system reacts to various thrusts from the motors. This allowed students to collect “Open-Loop” system data. Using the data acquisition system, students were able to identify the system and calculate coefficients for the controller and implement a “Closed- Loop” control system. Students successfully implemented a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller that satisfies all design requirements including robust functionality. Currently, all milestones for the project have been accomplished and plans for continuation of the project are underway...|$|R
