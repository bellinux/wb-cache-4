6000|$|... "Fudge!" [...] {{replied the}} spectre. [...] "The lease and {{furniture}} {{were left to}} an old lady, who was not <b>to</b> <b>underlet</b> the house nor sell the things. She had a house of her own in Albemarle Street which she preferred, and so the house in Berkeley Square was never let till the lease expired. That's the whole affair. The house was empty, and political economists could conceive no reason for the waste of rent {{except that it was}} haunted. The rest was all Miss Broughton's imagination, in 'Tales for Christmas Eve.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now that I {{was left}} wholly to myself, I gave notice of my {{intention}} {{to quit the}} chambers in the Temple {{as soon as my}} tenancy could legally determine, and in the meanwhile <b>to</b> <b>underlet</b> them. At once I put bills up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless as to that.|$|E
6000|$|Flora's gentle voice carried {{conviction}} {{that she knew}} what she was saying, when, at last, they left a moment for her to speak--(Ethel would have done so long ago). [...] "If I am not mistaken, the land is a copyhold of Sir Henry Walkinghame, held under the manor of Drydale, which belongs to M---- College, and is <b>underlet</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Nicolson." ...|$|R
60|$|This favoured tavern, {{sacred to}} the evening orgies of Mr. Lowten and his companions, was what {{ordinary}} people would designate a public-house. That the landlord {{was a man of}} money-making turn was sufficiently testified by the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap-room window, in size and shape not unlike a sedan-chair, being <b>underlet</b> <b>to</b> a mender of shoes: and that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident from the protection he afforded to a pieman, who vended his delicacies without fear of interruption, on the very door-step. In the lower windows, which were decorated with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled two or three printed cards, bearing reference to Devonshire cider and Dantzic spruce, while a large blackboard, announcing in white letters to an enlightened public, that there were 500,000 barrels of double stout in the cellars of the establishment, left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise direction {{in the bowels of the}} earth, in which this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend. When we add that the weather-beaten signboard bore the half-obliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint, which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to consider as the 'stump,' we have said all that need be said of the exterior of the edifice.|$|R
