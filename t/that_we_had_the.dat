2500|$|Carlton's second album, Harmonium was {{released}} in November 2004. Harmonium debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 and descended quickly after; selling less than 150,000 copies as of February 2006, which was considered a disappointment after her successful debut. It was produced by Stephan Jenkins from Third Eye Blind, and included darker themes than those on her debut. Carlton and Jenkins met and began a relationship in mid-2002, when she and rock band Third Eye Blind, of which Jenkins is lead singer, were on tour together. After seeing Carlton perform live, Jenkins entered her dressing room and expressed interest in producing her music, and according to Carlton they [...] "decided very quickly, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same vision for the album". Carlton credited Jenkins with helping her to withstand and protect herself from pressures the record label executives, who wanted to influence the recording process, placed on her. According to Carlton, her label [...] "wasn't very happy" [...] about the decisions she made during {{the making of the}} album. Carlton stated that the album contained more of her own aesthetic as opposed to Be Not Nobody which was more influenced by Ron Fair. A single, [...] "White Houses", released to radio in late-August 2004, peaking at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. MTV censored and later banned the single's music video because of a controversial lyric in the song that refers to sexual intercourse. Carlton attributed the censoring of the song to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy involving Janet Jackson which had occurred earlier that year.|$|E
