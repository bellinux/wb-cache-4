40|$|AbstractA matroid may be {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> its <b>bases</b> or by <b>the</b> collection of its circuits. Along with any matroid is a uniquely determined dual matroid. Given <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid, {{it is possible to}} show that base complements are precisely <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual. So it is easy to construct <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual given <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original matroid. This paper provides two results. The first enables construction of all circuits of the dual matroid from circuits of the original matroid. The second constructs all <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid from its circuits...|$|R

This inversion results in another non-Wythoffian uniform convex honeycomb. Octahedral prisms and tetrahedral prisms may be inserted in between alternated laminae as well, resulting in two more non-Wythoffian elongated uniform honeycombs.|$|R

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the plant.|$|E
