I went then to Mr. Lewis, first secretary to Lord Dartmouth,(18) and favourite to Mr. Harley, who is to introduce me to-morrow morning. Lewis had with him one Mr. Dyot,(19) a Justice of Peace, worth twenty thousand pounds, a Commissioner of the Stamp Office, and married to a sister of Sir Philip Meadows,(20) Envoy to the Emperor. I tell you this, because it is odds but this Mr. Dyot will be hanged; for he is discovered to have counterfeited stamped paper, in which he was a Commissioner; and, with his accomplices, has cheated the Queen of a hundred thousand pounds. You will hear of it before this come to you, but may be not so particularly; and it is a very odd accident in such a man. Smoke Presto writing news to MD. I dined to-day with Lord Mountjoy at Kensington, and walked from thence this evening to town like an emperor.

Well, but I should write plainer, when I consider Stella cannot read,(21) and Dingley is not so skilful at my ugly hand. I had tonight a letter from Mr. Pratt, who tells me Joe will have his money when there are trustees appointed by the Lord Lieutenant for receiving and disposing the linen fund; and whenever those trustees are appointed, I will solicit whoever is Lord Lieutenant, and am in no fear of succeeding. So pray tell or write him word, and bid him not be cast down; for Ned Southwell(22) and Mr. Addison both think Pratt in the right. Don't lose your money at Manley's to-night, sirrahs.|$|E

40|$|The daily {{effective}} {{federal funds}} rate contains noise—that is, departures from the target level established by the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) that reflect idiosyncratic conditions in the interbank loan market. Averaging the daily data across a month or quarter {{is one way to}} cancel most of this noise, and, for this reason, the monthly or quarterly average of the daily {{federal funds rate}} has become a widely used measure of monetary policy. The first chart on page 10 of this publication, for example, plots a quarterly average as the actual federal funds rate in a Taylor rule description of monetary policy. The monthly average is also the benchmark for payoffs in the federal funds futures market. One often-neglected consequence of monthly averaging, however, is that any change in the target federal funds rate will affect the monthly average for two months. For example, if the FOMC raised the target by 50 basis points precisely halfway through <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> then the monthly average for <b>this</b> <b>month</b> will rise <b>by</b> 25 basis points relative to last month, and next month’s average will also exceed <b>this</b> <b>month’s</b> average <b>by</b> 25 basis points, all else equal. Similarly, if the FOMC raised the target by 50 basis points threequarters of the way through <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> then the expected monthly average for the next <b>month</b> would rise <b>by</b> 37. 5 basis points. To gauge how strongly target changes in one month affect the change in the monthly average funds rate from that month to the next, I estimated two regressions of the change in the monthly average on its own lagged value. In one regression, I also included information about how the size and timing of any target change in the previous <b>month</b> would affect <b>this</b> <b>month’s</b> average.
