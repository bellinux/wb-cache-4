40|$|The high {{frequency}} of passives in scientific writing is also substantiated by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman’s (1983 : 228) frequency continuum. It is their {{high frequency}} in scientific writing that renders   passive structures unignorable for scientific translators {{as well as}} indispensible enough for this paper to revisit these constructions. From the p erspectives on <b>translating</b> <b>the</b> passive structure from English to Vietnamese, s trategies for <b>translating</b> <b>the</b> passive structure in scientific writing were proposed to guide scientific translators on how to <b>translate</b> <b>the</b> passive structure without actor, <b>translate</b> <b>the</b> English nominalizations following the verbs of experience, and <b>translate</b> <b>the</b> English passive structure in the relative clause of place as well as when to retain the actor in <b>the</b> <b>translated</b> text. </p...|$|R

5|$|Another {{interest}} of his was indology – {{one of the}} main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He <b>translated</b> <b>the</b> Sanskrit play Shakuntala using a Latin version provided by Sir William Jones; this strongly influenced Herder and triggered German interest in the culture of India.|$|E
5|$|Anquetil Duperron, a French Orientalist {{received}} a manuscript of the Oupanekhat and <b>translated</b> <b>the</b> Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation {{in two volumes}} in 1801–1802 as Oupneck'hat.

However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.|$|E

An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012: players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply the patch, which <b>translated</b> <b>the</b> game's text into English. Compatible with the Extra Edition, the patch was released in January 2014.|$|E
5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793.

François Lanthenas, who <b>translated</b> <b>The</b> Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
