Whereas on Venus's dayside the cloud <b>top</b> <b>motions</b> are well determined and Venus general circulation models predict a mean zonal flow at the upper clouds similar on both day and nightside, the nightside circulation remains poorly studied except for the polar region. Here we report global measurements of the nightside circulation at the upper cloud level.

40|$|We {{consider}} the steady group motions of a rigid {{body with a}} fixed point moving in a gravitational field. For an asymmetric top, rotation about the axis of gravity is the only permissible group motion; for a Lagrange top, simultaneous rotation about the axis of gravity and spin about the axis of symmetry of the top is permissible. Our analysis of the heavy top follows the reduced energy momentum method of Simo et al, which is applicable {{to a wide range}} of conservative systems with symmetry. Steady group motions are characterized as solutions of a variational problem on the configuration space; local minima of the amended potential correspond to nonlinearly orbitally stable steady motions. The combination of a low-dimensional configuration space and a relatively large number of parameters that produce substantial qualitative changes in the dynamics makes possible a thorough, detailed analysis, which not only reproduces the classical results for this well known system, but leads to some results which we believe are new. We determine general equilibrium and nonlinear stability conditions for steady group motions of a heavy top with a fixed point. We rederive the classical equilibrium and stability conditions for sleeping tops and precessing Lagrange tops, analyse in detail the stability of a family of steady rotations of tilted tops which bifurcate from the branch of sleeping tops parametrized by angular velocity, and classify the possible stability transitions of an arbitrary top as its angular velocity is increased. We obtain a simple, general expression for the characteristic polynomial of the linearized equations of motion and analyse the linear stability of both sleeping tops and the family of tilted <b>top</b> <b>motions</b> previously mentioned. Finally, we demonstrate the coexistence of stable branches of steadily precessing tops that bifurcate from the branch of sleeping Lagrange tops throughout the range of angular velocities for which the sleeping top is stable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is used {{to study}} laminar flow with mixed {{convection}} heat transfer inside a two-dimensional inclined lid-driven rectangular cavity with aspect ratio AR = 3. Bottom wall of the cavity is maintained at lower temperature than the top lid, and its vertical walls are assumed insulated. <b>Top</b> lid <b>motion</b> results in fluid motion inside the cavity. Inclination of the cavity causes horizontal and vertical components of velocity {{to be affected by}} buoyancy force. To include this effect, calculation procedure of macroscopic properties by LBM is changed and collision term of Boltzmann equation is modified. A computer program is developed to simulate this problem using BGK model of lattice Boltzmann method. The effects of the variations of Richardson number and inclination angle on the thermal and flow behavior of the fluid inside the cavity are investigated. The results are presented as velocity and temperature profiles, stream function contours and isotherms. It is concluded that LBM has good potential to simulate mixed convection heat transfer problems. Keywords—gravity, inclined lid driven cavity, lattice Boltzmann method, mixed convection. I...|$|R
50|$|The Uranian axis of {{rotation}} is approximately parallel with {{the plane of the}} Solar System, with an axial tilt of 97.77° (as defined by prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away. Only a narrow strip around the equator experiences a rapid day-night cycle, but with the Sun low over the horizon. At the other side of Uranus's orbit the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness. Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus giving a period of day-night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets. In contrast to the other planets, whose motions around the Sun resemble that of spinning <b>tops,</b> Uranus's <b>motion</b> can be visualised as that of a ball rolling on the ecliptic plane near solstices and of a spinning rifle bullet near equinoxes.|$|R

This mixed fluid must be separated for subsequent processes by using wash tanks or separators. To design such a system, a proper numerical-prediction tool for multiphase fluids is required.

The new MPS method for multifluid system includes extra search methods for interface particles, boundary conditions for interfaces, buoyancy-correction model, and surface-tension model for interface particles. The new particle interaction models are verified through comparisons with published numerical and experimental data.
