The microstructures of the newly developed ternary Sn– 9 Zn–X solder alloys were composed of fine needle-like α-Zn phase with some IMC dispersed in the β-Sn matrix. The relatively small and compact shaped Al 6 Zn 3 Sn IMC was found to be uniformly distributed in the β-Sn phase which results in an increase in the tensile strength, due to the second phase dispersed strengthening mechanism. On the contrary, the large flower shaped Cu 6 Sn 5 and rod shaped Cu 5 Zn 8 IMC develops some sort of weak interface with the parent β-Sn matrix results in a decrease in the tensile strength.

Both <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> were tested at the joint-scale (~ 180 μm) using specially designed specimens on a shear testing facility developed at the Stokes Institute. With the use of new lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> in electronic manufacturing processes, there are two critical considerations: reliability and cost. The reliability of electronic assemblies is linked to the mechanical performance of solder joints. SAC 105 is more cost effective than SAC 305 due to its lower silver content than SAC 305, but it is known to exhibit inferior reliability to SAC 305 under thermal fatigue. An Anand viscoplastic constitutive model is developed in this thesis for thermally preconditioned SAC 105 from a series of creep tests under varying constant shear stresses (5 MPa to 15 MPa), constant shear strain rates (1 E- 6 (1 /s) to 1 E- 2 (1 /s)) and temperatures (20 ºC to 100 ºC), in order to increase the understanding of the creep behaviour of the alloy. An extensive comparison is made of the creep characteristics of SAC 105 <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> to that of SAC 305. The microstructure of both alloys is found to be a beta-Sn matrix with precipitates of Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5; SAC 305 is noted to feature more Ag 3 Sn precipitates and smaller Sn dendrites than SAC 105, which are the primary reasons for its superior creep resistance. In terms of practical usage, SAC 105 is found to be preferable for applications which may experience high strain rate stimuli (portable electronic devices) as the alloy undergoes plastic flow at lower stress levels than SAC 305, minimizing the risk of interfacial failures. SAC 305 is superior for applications which feature thermo-mechanical fatigue (desktop computers, for example, or servers) as it accumulates less strain than SAC 105. SAC 105 is found to be significantly less creep resistant than SAC 305. With the Anand model parameters developed here, however, practitioners using finite element modelling can determine the suitability of the lower cost SAC 105 alloy for applications which induce thermal fatigue...|$|R

In the present work, effects of trace amounts of rare earth Ce on the wettability, mechanical properties and microstructure of Sn-Ag-Cu solder {{have been investigated}} by means of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis systematically.

Moreover, it was observed that the trace amount of rare earth Ce in Sn-Ag-Cu solder may refine the joint matrix microstructure, modify the Cu 6 Sn 5 intermetallic phase at the copper substrate/ solder interface, and the intermetallic compound layer thickness was reduced significantly. In addition, since rare earth Ce possesses a higher affinity to Sn in the alloy, adding of rare earth Ce can also lead to the delayed formation and growth of the intermetallic compounds of Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 in the alloy. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Surface morphology and elemental quantitative analysis of the <b>soldering</b> <b>alloys</b> before and after intra-oral placement in patients was determined by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM/EDX). Statistical analysis was performed by t-test, Mann Whitney tests and Pearson's correlation. For all tests a 95 % confidence level was used (α = 0. 05). Results. Both <b>soldering</b> <b>alloys</b> demonstrated substantially increase in surface roughness after intra-oral aging. Statistical analysis illustrated a significant decrease in the Cu and Zn content after treatment. OS demonstrated higher Cu release than US (p 0. 05) with intra-oral exposure time, apart from Zn in OS (r = 0. 840, p = 0. 04). Conclusions. Both <b>soldering</b> <b>alloys</b> demonstrated a significant Cu and Zn reduction after intra-oral exposure that may raise biocompatibility concerns...|$|R
40|$|The {{packaging}} of optoelectronics and MEMS devices is placing challenging {{requirements for}} the interconnection and soldering technology. These requirements {{can no longer be}} met with standard flux– based processes which use a long temperature reflow profile and are implementing a lot of mechanical handling steps and processes. Basically, the packaging of these new devices is requiring fluxless soldering, no thermal stress by localized heating, low respectively no mechanical contact and damage on sensitive membranes in MEMS or optical components (like lenses, etc.). Some of these applications even require 3 D–packaging and selective solder application in 3 D-structures, like cavity, vertical assembly, etc. An additional, very challenging requirement is a high flexibility in <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> because eutectic tin lead and other lead-based <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> are not applicable. Instead Gold/Tin and Indium-based <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> are required. In order to fulfill the specific needs in these applications, a new laser-based solder jetting technology has been developed. This technology fulfills all the needs of fluxless soldering, local heating and reflow, no mechanical contact and stress during <b>soldering,</b> high <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> flexibility and capability of 3 D-packaging. Prior to developing the Solder Ball Bumper Jet (SB-Jet) process, many potential applications have bee...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{percentages}} of Al {{addition to the}} microstructure of bulk, intermetallic compound (IMC) formation, wetting properties and mechanical properties of Sn- 0. 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 0305) <b>solder</b> <b>alloy</b> was investigated. SAC 0305, SAC- 0. 5 Al, SAC- 1 Al, SAC- 1. 5 Al and SAC- 2 Al were prepared via casting process. The <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> were reflowed onto Cu substrate at 260 ºC for 10 seconds. The composition of each <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> were determined using XRF. DSC {{was used to evaluate}} the thermal characteristics while wetting balance test and spreading test were used to analyze the wettability. The microstructures of the bulk solder as well as the interfacial IMC layer were observed using SEM equipped with EDX. Meanwhile, ball shear test was carried out to assess the reliability of the solder joints. The wettability of <b>solder</b> <b>alloys</b> decreased with the increasing amount of Al, but still within the acceptable range. Addition of Al resulted in the formation of Ag 3 Al and Cu-Al IMC, lowered the amount of Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC and refined β-Sn dendrites. Further addition of Al above 1 wt. ...|$|R
