5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although {{he would no longer}} be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking}} the train.

5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK43.0 million, while <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> would involve the southern side and cost NOK35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|E

50|$|The launch {{proceeded}} {{according to}} plan until T+288.6 seconds {{at an altitude of}} 145 km, when <b>the</b> second and <b>third</b> <b>stages</b> of <b>the</b> booster began separation. Only three of the six locks holding the stages together released and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage's</b> engine ignited with the second stage still attached below it. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage's</b> thrust broke <b>the</b> remaining locks, throwing the second stage free but putting the booster under unexpected strain that caused it to deviate from the proper trajectory. At T+295 seconds, the deviation was detected by the Soyuz's guidance system, which activated an automatic abort program. As the escape tower was long gone by this point, the abort had to be performed with the Soyuz's own engines. This separated the spacecraft from the third-stage booster and then separated the orbital and service modules of the Soyuz from the re-entry capsule.|$|R
5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial. On the second stage, he was donned the yellow jersey {{thanks to a}} third place, which gave him four bonus seconds. He {{was involved in a}} mass pile-up on <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> and finished the race slowly. After a visit to the hospital, it was revealed that he had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in his lower back and he had to abandon.|$|E
5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest dweller) and Sannyasa (renunciation) as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Aucouturier {{had a clear}} lead and seemed set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> the Tour {{returned}} to France; at the border, the riders were stopped by two French customs {{officers and the}} delay took so long that the stage had to be restarted.
