5000|$|During {{his tenure}} as an Iron Chef, Nakamura was always {{compared}} to Michiba, who was regarded as the <b>top</b> <b>Iron</b> Chef during his tenure. It was said that Nakamura was even ostracised by his family whenever he lost, which was why Nakamura had acquired a pet Shiba dog named [...] "Chef" [...] one year into his tenure. Curiously, despite a sub-par overall performance as an Iron Chef, Nakamura has won the majority of battles against returning challengers going 3-1-1 and other Iron Chefs going 2-1. After a grueling battle with Toshiro Kandagawa (in which he lost), Nakamura retired from kitchen stadium in 1998 {{at the age of}} 50. His final battle was against Yukio Hattori in Tuna Battle on February 20, 1998, a battle in which he won. He did return for Iron Chef Morimoto's one year anniversary, which was Battle Egg on March 12, 1999 (a battle in which he won).|$|E
50|$|Open fire systems {{had three}} major {{disadvantages}} that prompted an evolutionary series of improvements from the 16th century onwards: it was dangerous, it produced much smoke, {{and the heat}} efficiency was poor. Attempts were made to enclose the fire to make better use of the heat that it generated and thus reduce the wood consumption. An early step was the fire chamber: the fire was enclosed on three sides by brick-and-mortar walls and covered by an iron plate. This technique also caused {{a change in the}} kitchenware used for cooking, for it required flat-bottomed pots instead of cauldrons. The first design that completely enclosed the fire was the 1735 Castrol stove, built by the French architect François de Cuvilliés.This stove was a masonry construction with several fireholes covered by perforated iron plates and was also known as a stew stove. Near the end of the 18th century, the design was refined by hanging the pots in holes through the <b>top</b> <b>iron</b> plate, thus improving heat efficiency even more.|$|E

40|$|Iron ore {{is among}} the biggest, {{non-energy}} extractive industry {{in the world in}} terms of value, and the biggest in terms of the volumes of cargo it channels in international trade. Two key characteristics of the iron ore market are central to its study: firstly, there is only a small number of buyers and sellers; and secondly, there is a great degree of interdependence among buyers and sellers and both groups are aware of this interdependence. For buyers, security of supplies is crucial. For sellers, long-term commitment from importers is essential in order to maintain the long-run viability of mining projects. Since the 1960 s, long-term contracts have been, and still are, the main vehicle used in international iron ore trade. Under the light of the above peculiarities of the iron market, a non-competitive analytical framework is adopted. This thesis proposes an alternative profit maximising behaviour different to the solutions offered by oligopoly and bilateral monopoly theorists. In this case, the importer enters negotiations with complete knowledge of his own minimum acceptable price, a possible idea of his partner's maximum acceptable price and also an idea (which can be held with varying degrees of certainty) of what alternative suppliers may be able to offer. This will restrict the range of prices over which negotiations take place and will mitigate the bargaining power of the seller. A buyer is likely to act in a similar manner, knowing that the seller has alternative export outlets, but he can also use other bargaining tools to achieve a better deal. A quite common tool is the promise of long term commitment through the signing of contracts, acquisition of equity stakes in mines or provision of financing facilities. The behaviour of the trading partners in such an oligopoly/oligopsony (or bilateral oligopoly) environment is also studied empirically with a relatively simple and tried econometric technique, borrowed from consumption and investment theory and applied for the first time for all <b>top</b> <b>iron</b> ore importers, who collectively have accounted for approximately 90...|$|E
