Theorell, 1990) {{indicates}} that job control {{and social support}} enable workers <b>to</b> engage in <b>problem</b> <b>solving.</b> In turn, <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> is thought <b>to</b> influence learning and well-being (e. g., anxious affect, activated pleasant affect). Two samples (N = 78, N = 106) provided data up to 4 times per day for up to 5 working days. The extent to which job control was used for <b>problem</b> <b>solving</b> was assessed by measuring {{the extent to which}} participants changed aspects of their work activities <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problems.</b> The extent <b>to</b> which social support was used <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problems</b> was assessed by measuring the extent to which participants discussed <b>problems</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problems.</b> Learning mediated the relationship between changing aspects of work activities <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problems</b> and activated pleasant affect. Learning also mediated the relationship between discussing <b>problems</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problems</b> and activated pleasant affect. The findings indicated that how individuals use control and support to respond to problem-solving demands is associated with organizational and individual phenomena, such as learning and affective well-being...|$|R

That is a contradiction. This means, that finding collisions cannot be easier than solving P.|$|E
5000|$|Kolmogorov {{followed}} the same lines but phrased his interpretation in terms of problems and solutions.

When this is true, solving A cannot be harder than solving B. [...] "Harder" [...] means having a higher estimate of the required computational resources in a given context (e.g., higher time complexity, greater memory requirement, expensive need for extra hardware processor cores for a parallel solution compared to a single-threaded solution, etc.).|$|E

We first give in Algorithm 3 the steps of the neighbourhood change function which will be used later. Function NeighbourhoodChange (...) compares the new value f(x') with the incumbent value f(x) obtained in the neighbourhood k (line 1). If an improvement is obtained, k is returned to its initial value and the new incumbent updated (line 2). Otherwise, the next neighbourhood is considered (line 3).|$|E
5000|$|As the {{application}} of precise algorithm <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problem</b> is very limited, we often use approximate algorithm or heuristic algorithm. The result of the algorithm can be assessed by C / C* ≤ ε [...] C is the total travelling distance generated from approximate algorithm; C* is the optimal travelling distance; ε is the upper limit for {{the ratio of the}} total travelling distance of approximate solution to optimal solution under the worst condition. The value of ε >1.0. The more it closes to 1.0, the better the algorithm is. These algorithms include: Interpolation algorithm, Nearest neighbour algorithm, Clark & Wright algorithm, Double spanning tree algorithm, Christofides algorithm, Hybrid algorithm, Probabilistic algorithm.|$|E

5000|$|According to Jenkins, [...] "Rather than {{dealing with}} each {{technology}} in isolation, {{we would do}} better to take an ecological approach, thinking about the interrelationship among different communication technologies, the cultural communities that grow up around them, and the activities they support." [...] Jenkins also suggested that the traditional school curriculum guided teachers to train students to be autonomous problem solvers. However, today's workers are increasingly asked to work in teams, drawing on different sets of expertise, and collaborating <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>problem.</b> Learning styles and the methods of collecting information have evolved, and [...] "students often feel locked out of the worlds described in their textbooks through the depersonalized and abstract prose used to describe them". These twenty-first century skills can be attained through the incorporation and engagement with technology. Changes in instruction and use of technology can also promote {{a higher level of}} learning among students with different types of intelligence.|$|E
