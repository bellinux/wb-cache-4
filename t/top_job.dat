5|$|Tangherlini was {{considered}} a leading candidate for Metro's <b>top</b> <b>job</b> on a permanent basis before he resigned to work as D.C. City Administrator under Mayor Adrian Fenty. On November 6, 2006, Tangherlini was replaced as interim general manager by Jack Requa, Metro's chief bus manager. John B. Catoe, Jr., who was previously the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, became the agency's eighth permanent General Manager on January 25, 2007. He resigned three years later following the deadliest crash in the Metrorail system's history.|$|E

They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker {{for the remainder of the}} 2007 season, before being appointed in August to the <b>top</b> <b>job</b> for two years. With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in 43 years, Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010, his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith. The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra, eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle.|$|E

25|$|Mueller became {{increasingly}} involved with NASA and the Apollo Program. NASA's Administrator James E.

Mueller accepted the job – although he took a substantial pay cut. The reorganization of NASA and the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF) was announced in November 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{aftermath}} {{of the world cup}} was similar to the last, as coach John Mitchell was dropped.

25|$|A {{few days}} later in the Second Test at Melbourne, with Benaud still absent, Simpson led Australia for the first time. Simpson's {{appointment}} to the <b>top</b> <b>job</b> raised eyebrows in some quarters, as he {{had a reputation for}} being abrasive, and others had been more successful and experienced at domestic level. Lawry had led Victoria to the Sheffield Shield in 1962–63 and Western Australia's Barry Shepherd had also been praised for his aggressive and bold leadership. At the time Simpson had scored only 1246 runs at 32.78 and taken 22 wickets at 39.40 in 23 Tests and had not scored a century.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{his reign}} as Barcelona manager, Cruyff {{suffered}} a heart attack and was advised to quit coaching by his doctors. When he left in 1996, he would never take another <b>top</b> <b>job,</b> but his influence would not end there. Though he vowed never to coach again, he remained a vocal football critic and analyst. Cruyff's open support helped candidate Joan Laporta to victory in Barcelona's presidential elections. He continued to be an adviser for him, although he held no official post at Barcelona. Back in an advisory capacity alongside Joan Laporta, he recommended the appointment of Frank Rijkaard in 2003. Again Barca was successful, winning back-to-back league titles and another Champions League crown in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, {{the deputy}} chief judge is no longer {{guaranteed}} the automatic right of succession to the <b>top</b> <b>job.</b> Under the new system the deputy only becomes acting chief judge {{in the event of}} a vacancy in the highest office, and only becomes chief judge in his own right if subsequently elected.

Even this rule only applies to a deputy chief judge who was appointed by an elected chief judge. A deputy chief judge appointed by an unelected chief judge does not become acting chief judge; instead there must be an election.|$|E

25|$|He {{scored a}} duck and 55 not out, {{being at the}} crease as Australia scored the winning runs to take a 1–0 lead in the series. Benaud then {{informed}} the Board of Control {{that he would be}} retiring at season's end, so it was arranged for Benaud to return to the team and play under Simpson to give the latter experience for the forthcoming tour of England. Australia lost the Fourth Test heavily by ten wickets, the other two matches were drawn, and the series finished 1–1. Simpson scored half-centuries in both the Third and Fourth Tests and ended the series with 361 runs at 40.11 average. His combination with Lawry consistently propelled Australia to solid starts, posting at least 50 in each of their opening stands. However, he continued to be plagued by an inability to convert his starts into large scores at the highest level of competition. He passed 25 in 8 of his 10 innings for the series, but could only manage three fifties. As a captain, Simpson was less willing to bowl, taking only two wickets for the Test series, and only four wickets in seven first-class matches since taking up the <b>top</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1967, a {{transition}} to an elected government was scheduled, and after a power struggle within the military, Thiệu ran for the presidency with Kỳ as his running mate--both men had wanted the <b>top</b> <b>job.</b> To allow the two to work together, their fellow officers had agreed to have a military body controlled by Kỳ shape policy behind the scenes. The election was rigged to ensure that Thiệu and Kỳ's military ticket would win, and strong executive powers meant that junta, in effect, still ruled. Leadership tensions persisted, and Thiệu prevailed, sidelining Kỳ supporters from key military and cabinet posts. Thiệu then passed legislation to restrict candidacy eligibility for the 1971 election, banning almost all would-be opponents; Kỳ and the rest withdrew as {{it was obvious that}} the poll would be a sham; Thiệu went on to win more than 90 percent of the vote and the election uncontested, while Kỳ retired. With the fall of Saigon, Kỳ fled to the United States. He continued to heavily criticize both the communists and Thiệu, and the former prevented him from returning. However, in 2004, he became the first South Vietnamese leader to return, calling for reconciliation between communists and anti-communists.|$|E

He ultimately [...] "grabbed hold of the <b>top</b> <b>job</b> [...] and never let go". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season {{because of concerns about}} Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, [...] "I see a real assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on." [...] On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of a double steal in an 11–4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997. [...] He eventually played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular starting catcher. Statistically, he committed only two errors, which tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a [...]259 batting average. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.|$|E
