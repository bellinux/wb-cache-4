5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E

50|$|Parker J 1981 1 Lloyd’s Rep 476 held <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> sold was not seed {{at all and}} did {{not look}} at the statute. On the basis that clause 1 said 'any seeds or plants sold', he held <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> sold could not be {{considered}} seeds (because they simply did not work) and therefore the exclusion in clause 2, which <b>was</b> attached to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> sold in clause 1 had no effect.|$|R
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> important is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Roach and Brinkman has called into {{question}} the cooperative pack hunting behavior of Deinonychus, based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the taphonomy of tenontosaur sites. Modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) and Komodo dragons display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is cannibalized. When this information {{is applied to the}} tenontosaur sites, it appears <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> found is consistent with Deinonychus having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other Deinonychus. On the other hand, a paper by Li et al. describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the origin}} of the burst was soon disputed, and by April 2016 it was {{established}} that the emission instead originates from an active galactic nucleus that is powered by a supermassive black hole with dual jets blasting outward from the black hole. It <b>was</b> also noted <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> thought to be an [...] "afterglow", did not fade away as would <b>be</b> expected, meaning <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> observed was unassociated with the actual fast radio burst.|$|R

5|$|As the GTA and PVE launch further {{attacks on}} the Shivans, it is quickly {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> left is unorganised, leading the alliance to co-ordinate a full invasion of their main strongholds, as other systems they occupied slowly return under Terran and Vasudan control. But as the last remaining threat from the Shivans is crushed, officers in the highest echelons of the GTI effect an attempt to cover-up plans for a coup against the GTA by going after the Krios, the only ship aware of the plot and thus {{a threat to their}} plans. However, the pilots sent out by the Krios during the final fight with the Shivans, return early, arriving in time to discover the treason and alert GTA command. Realising that much of the GTI has gone rogue and fighting against the alliance, the remnants of the GTI loyal to the GTA cause is merged with its battle-groups and begins conducting operations to bring down the ringleaders, including the capture of the Repulse.|$|E

25|$|Sunglasses or sun {{glasses are}} a visual aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent strong light {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sufficient}} to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic {{can be reduced to}} a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> true in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate conic).|$|E

25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not {{necessarily}} {{play an important role in}} structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967). Others argued <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966). The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Some in Japan have {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> being demanded is {{that the}} Japanese Prime Minister or the Emperor perform dogeza, in which an individual kneels and bows {{his head to the}} ground—a high form of apology in East Asian societies that Japan appears unwilling to do.

25|$|The {{dilemma is}} that {{classical}} evolutionary theory says <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> maintained in a lineage {{is that which}} ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could only evolve as a side effect, or epiphenomenon of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical evolution theory (See neo-Darwinism) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.|$|E
