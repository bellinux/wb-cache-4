500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|NPR critic Bob Mondello {{adds that}} [...] "despite {{working with a}} plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a {{character}} check {{the soles of his}} boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he's checking for." ...|$|E

After a positive article in PC Week, the company was selling 1,000 machines per month. Michael Dell appeared in PC's Limited advertisements in national magazines, asking readers to [...] "give us a chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> [...] can do". Dell's family went on to lend him $500,000 to fund {{the growth of the}} company, but the loans were repaid in 1986.
