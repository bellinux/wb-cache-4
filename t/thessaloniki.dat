5|$|He {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} combat during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. As a young officer, he was stationed, {{along with his}} elder brother, in the field staff of his father; and he accompanied the latter {{at the head of}} the Army of Thessaly during the capture of <b>Thessaloniki</b> in 1912. King George I was assassinated in <b>Thessaloniki</b> soon afterwards, and Alexander's father ascended the throne as Constantine I.|$|E
5|$|In 894 Stylianos Zaoutzes, basileopator {{and leading}} {{minister}} of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), convinced the emperor {{to move the}} Bulgarian market from Constantinople to <b>Thessaloniki.</b> That move affected not only private interests but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated with the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The Bulgarian merchants were allowed to live in Constantinople, resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes. The city was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia and {{the transfer of the}} Bulgarian market to <b>Thessaloniki</b> cut short the direct access to goods from the east, which under the new circumstances the Bulgarians would have to buy through middlemen, who were close associates of Stylianos Zaoutzes. In <b>Thessaloniki</b> the Bulgarians were also forced to pay higher tariffs to sell their goods, enriching Zaoutzes' cronies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{capitulation}} of TSAM, {{the remnants of}} the 19th Mechanized Division surrendered to the Germans at Serres in the afternoon of 10 April, while {{the remnants of the}} Krousia Detachment did so near <b>Thessaloniki.</b> The division's commander, chief of staff, and a few other officers chose instead to withdraw to the area of Chalkidiki. Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon as news came of the fall of <b>Thessaloniki,</b> the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, Bojić {{reached the}} Greek island of Corfu, {{where he was}} {{recruited}} to work for Serbian military intelligence. That summer, he was transferred to <b>Thessaloniki,</b> where he continued working for the military. In August, he was granted leave and sailed to France, where he reunited with his fiancée and his brother. Bojić returned to Greece several weeks later, and was diagnosed with tuberculosis in September the following year. Owing to the political connections of his patrons, he managed to find care at an exclusive military hospital in <b>Thessaloniki,</b> but by late October his condition worsened. He died in early November {{at the age of}} 25. He was initially buried at the Allied military cemetery at Zeitenlik, but in 1922, his siblings had his remains relocated to Belgrade, where they were reburied beside those of his parents.|$|E
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize <b>Thessaloniki.</b> After the Arabs plundered the city, {{it was an easy}} target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of <b>Thessaloniki.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Panzer Division (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia {{from the}} east {{on the morning of}} 6 April and {{advanced}} westward through the Struma Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, mines and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day's objective, the town of Strumica. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counter-attack against the division's northern flank was repelled, and the following day, the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the thinly manned defensive line of the Greek 19th Mechanized Division south of Doiran Lake. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward <b>Thessaloniki</b> succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April. <b>Thessaloniki</b> was taken after a long battle with three Greek divisions under the command of General Bakopoulos, and was followed by the surrender of the Greek Eastern Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on 10 April. In the three days it took the Germans to reach <b>Thessaloniki</b> and breach the Metaxas Line, some 60,000 Greek soldiers were taken prisoner. The British and Commonwealth forces then took over the defence of Greece, with the bulk of the Greek Army fighting to maintain their old positions in Albania.|$|E

5|$|The Venizelist advance was not {{an attempt}} to {{undermine}} the king's pact with Bénazet, since it had been planned long before that. The failure of the secret agreement was caused by subversive activities within segments of the royalist government in Athens to paralyze and disrupt the <b>Thessaloniki</b> provisional government.|$|E
5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into <b>Thessaloniki,</b> just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of <b>Thessaloniki,</b> the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Petar Mutafchiev, {{after the battle}} Samuil was {{in control of the}} Balkans. According to some historians, the northeastern parts of the Bulgarian Empire were liberated in the years after the battle. However, according to other sources, they were liberated ten years prior to the battle, in 976. The Bulgarians firmly took the initiative and launched continuous attacks towards <b>Thessaloniki,</b> Edessa, and the Adriatic coast. The Serbs were also defeated and their state incorporated into Bulgaria.|$|E

The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|Macedonia (as {{a current}} {{geographical}} term) {{refers to a}} region of the Balkan peninsula in south-eastern Europe, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around <b>Thessaloniki</b> and Serres.|$|E
5|$|Nothing is {{mentioned}} of Strez until {{the events in}} the wake of the sudden death of Tsar Kaloyan (1197–1207) during his siege of the Crusader-held <b>Thessaloniki.</b> Just like Alexius Slav, another noble who would later emerge as a separatist, Strez was a nephew of the Asen brothers Peter, Ivan Asen and Kaloyan, who were the first three emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, it is unclear whether through his relation to the early Asens he was a first cousin or a brother of Boril (1207–1218).|$|E

5|$|The Ottomans did {{not keep}} Macedonia as an {{administrative}} unit: since 1864 parts of geographical Macedonia lay in three vilayets, which also comprised some non-Macedonian areas. Northern Macedonia {{was part of the}} Kosovo vilayet and then of Skopje; the <b>Thessaloniki</b> (south Macedonia), and the Monastir (Central Macedonia) vilayet were also created.

5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, {{the gains}} in the east against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the Arabs in 902, and in 904 <b>Thessaloniki,</b> the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E
5|$|With Simeon on the throne, the {{long-lasting}} {{peace with}} the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, allegedly acting under pressure from his mistress Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to <b>Thessaloniki,</b> where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The Bulgarians sought protection by Simeon, who in turn complained to Leo. However, the Byzantine emperor ignored his embassy.|$|E
