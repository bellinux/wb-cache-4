5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E
25|$|Believer {{was formed}} in Colebrook, Pennsylvania in 1986 by drummer Joey Daub and vocalist-guitarist Kurt Bachman. The band was joined by Howe Kraft (bass) and David Baddorf (guitar). They began playing melodic metal and {{released}} the cassette The Return in 1987. Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ”We realized that we could write thrash better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> write anything else”.|$|E
25|$|Sportwereld was {{so young}} and so small for the big Ronde that we wanted. We had bitten off more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> chew. It was hard, seeing a band of second-class riders riding across Flanders, {{scraping}} {{up a handful of}} centimes to help cover the costs. The same happened in 1914. No van Hauwaert, no Masselis, no Defraeye, no Mosson, no Mottiat, no Van Den Berghe, all forbidden to take part by their French bike companies.|$|E

25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
500|$|Film is {{absolutely}} right for this project. It has scale, big exterior locations and that's something that still challenges HD.... The HD cameras available to us on our budget are still vulnerable in difficult weather conditions [...] There's no doubt that what we've got on 35mm is just so much more detailed. It has so much more depth of field and richness <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have got on HD.|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, the Surgeon General, Thomas Parran, Jr., {{appeared}} before the House Committee on Military Affairs and said, [...] "In my opinion, the country has received and increasingly will receive substantial returns on this investment.

White County Bridge Commission member Jim Clark stated, [...] "the cost to make repairs was more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> imagine." [...] However, Clark then made the decision to close the bridge immediately after receiving the complete report from a team of nine engineers who inspected the bridge on April 29.|$|E
500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ever have imagined." [...] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage {{for the first time at}} the Cabaret Metro.|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|By then, the {{positions}} of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941. The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942, wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar. American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing [...] "ninety percent of the work" [...] on the bomb, it would be [...] "better for us to go along for the present without sharing anything more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> help". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so slowed down the American project. In retaliation, the British stopped sending information and scientists to America, and the Americans then stopped all information sharing.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Johnny Blaze, Schwartz {{said that}} [...] "Marvel TV is {{introducing}} {{the idea of}} multiple Ghost Riders into its mythology, which {{sets the stage for}} Robbie Reyes not being the only one possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in this world. That's more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have hoped for Agents of SHIELDs take on the iconic Marvel hero." [...] She [...] speculated that a spin-off featuring Blaze and/or Reyes was now a realistic possibility. Buxton said that [...] "Marvel just established a much bigger Ghost Rider mythos that can be explored on TV, in movies, or Netflix and that is really damn exciting." [...] Valentine felt the appearance was a [...] "pretty amazing development", and stated, [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. almost seemed hamstrung by its connections to the Marvel Universe, seemingly unable to make a move without first consulting what precisely was happening in the movie universe. [...] we’re shown what Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been all along: a sister piece that plays to the outer elements of the MCU that the movies haven’t been able to touch." ...|$|E

60|$|Reuben Cox {{was able}} to move about {{on the fourth day}} after he succeeded in getting inside the fort, and as I saw this man and that, who had {{formerly}} been his close comrades, move aside lest he should speak to them, I decided that the man's punishment was far greater <b>than</b> any <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have inflicted upon him. Death, according to my way of thinking, would have been far preferable to being thus scorned.|$|R
500|$|Tonight {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album has a total score of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 32 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". It {{did not receive}} the amount of critical acclaim their first two studio albums received. Critics often praised the album's sound and the instrumentation of the songs on the album. The album's sound was also subject to criticism by some critics, {{as well as the}} lyrics and album production. Clash magazine commented that it could be [...] "the band's most complete work to date. Worth the wait, and in all honesty better <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ever have hoped for." [...] The Financial Post states that [...] "Tonight is the band's best album: Paradoxically, they've allowed themselves a degree of release from their characteristic tension by creating structures within which they can cut loose." [...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything that has made the band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one. Smart and danceable, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand proves that Franz Ferdinand are the masters of dance-rock." [...] NBC commented on how 'Franz Ferdinand has once again managed to outdo themselves with their best album to date.' ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the back}} of two {{consecutive}} playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: [...] "I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes." [...] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as [...] "phenomenal" [...] and criticized his supporting cast, stating Duncan [...] "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free throws, adding four assists and two blocks nd once again, he did not have enough help." [...] Also, Robinson said [...] "Tim [...] was like Superman out there", and conceded that the Lakers were simply better, just like in the last playoffs campaign.|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music crtitcs. Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's {{doing in this}} song {{is so much more}} impossibly fun <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars. Emily Mackay of The Quietus wrote in detail about the song: ...|$|E

60|$|During {{those hours}} of peace we ate {{the food that}} {{remained}} to us, washed ourselves as thoroughly as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> and rested. Well was it, in view of what followed, that we had this time of repose. For just as the breeze was failing I looked aft and there, coming up behind us, still holding the wind, was the whole fleet of Pongo canoes, thirty or forty of them perhaps, each carrying {{an average of about}} twenty men. We sailed on for as long as <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> for though our progress was but slow, it was quicker <b>than</b> what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have made by paddling.

Of the four men who remained, only Peltier {{was strong enough to}} stand and greet them. The floorboards had been dug up for firewood, and the skins which covered the windows had been removed and eaten by the starving men. Richardson wrote that [...] "the ghastly countenances, dilated eyeballs and sepulchral voices of Captain John Franklin and those with him were more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> at first bear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{commander}} of United States Special Operations Command, General Bryan D. Brown, commented on Combat Controllers in a May 2011 {{interview with the}} publication, The Year in Special Operations 2011-2012 Edition, stating: [...] "During this kind of warfare the USAF combat controller [...] guys really carried an incredible load. During the opening days in Afghanistan, we deployed some SF teams without a CCT, {{and the difference between}} those that had controllers and those that didn’t was dramatic. Quite frankly no one wants to go to war without them. They are admired, capable, and requested at a rate far greater <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ever provide. Their efforts were critical {{in the early days of}} OEF and still are. Here is another force [...] true impact on the battlefields around the world will never be known or appreciated.
