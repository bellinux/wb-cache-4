5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned {{of the success of}} Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{battle was}} bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin {{and a part}} of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, {{planting}} the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled {{with the arrival of the}} flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit, but more than 50,000 were taken prisoner. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded and captured while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to cross the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|In <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to escape}} before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover {{records in the}} library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, {{only to find that}} Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, {{they were the ones who}} dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock.|$|E

25|$|After the Labour Party won the 1945 election, Creech Jones was {{appointed}} as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, with The Times wondering {{why he was}} not given a more senior post. He was a delegate to the first sitting of the United Nations General Assembly in London in 1946. Creech Jones' support for eventual self-government of the colonies by all their inhabitants was unpopular with those colonies which were run by British settlers, {{and he had to}} moderate his speeches when he visited colonies such as Kenya. He also dealt with the British mandate in Palestine, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of peacefully establishming the Jewish state.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe arrived outside Quebec on 28 June. For much of {{the rest}} of the summer, he probed the defences of the city, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> through. Montcalm {{constantly}} frustrated him, shifting his own troops about in response. The cat-and-mouse game between the two generals reached a climax towards the end of the summer. If Wolfe could not capture the city he would likely be forced to withdraw in the face of the hostile Canadian winter. An attempt to land on the Montmorency was beaten back at the Battle of Beauport, and almost proved disastrous. Wolfe now searched for another place to land and make his attack. On 12 September the British learned of a convenient landing spot, and Wolfe moved his army there at night. The following day the Battle of the Plains of Abraham took place. It proved to be a decisive British victory, though one in which both Wolfe and Montcalm were killed. The British then took over the city.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{conservation}} efforts being implemented to increase populations now {{is the use of}} hatcheries for protected egg incubation, the goal of which is to create a protected environment for the hatchlings where they can incubate and emerge from the sand without threat of predators and then be released out to sea safely. Unfortunately, this result has not been documented in practice. Often, when hatchlings emerge from the sand in the incubator, they remain enclosed inside and expend much of their preserved energy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out. They also lose the extremely important dark, night hours used to get far away from shore. They are released out to sea, often in the early morning hours, when many predators are about, which limits their chance of survival. In addition, the hatchlings are also often too weak to gain a long distance from shore due to the energy lost in the incubator after hatching. These results have led many to believe that hatcheries are ineffective and should only be used as a last resort. No extensive research has shown the survival rate of the hatchlings after they are released to sea, but one study proclaimed a possible 50% loss after release.|$|E

500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also quite obvious in that 'Fill the Void' {{takes place in a}} world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Tenacious D {{started their}} second {{nationwide}} concert tour, performing at larger venues, {{many of which}} sold out. Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars, rarely with a full backing band. The band has also staged two international concert tours as well as numerous domestic tours, though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are [...] "a little funky" [...] because [...] "the subtleties do get lost in translation". In addition, he comments on the angst they experience before concerts saying: [...] "We're {{always looking for a}} loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to cancel the show at the last minute." [...] The band permits live recording during concerts if the venue allows recording. Many of these recordings have been recorded and released through Live Music Archive and are available for free digital download.|$|E

They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks.

It's being aware of it and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for it to be able to discuss {{in a way that makes}} sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E

A man picks the ticket out of the trash and is then hit by a truck after Weems warned him (to no avail) that [...] "something bad will happen." [...] Later, Mulder comes to {{question}} Weems again and another one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems but his bullet ricochets off Weems' pocket knife, barely grazes Mulder's arm, and hits and kills the enforcer. Weems confesses that he's been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to get $100,000 to pay for an expensive medical treatment for the serious illness of a boy in his apartment building named Richie (Shia LaBeouf). Weems attempts at getting the money, however, have brought him above the radar. Later, after Weems is hit by a car, it appears that Henry's lucky streak has reached its end. Cutrona kidnaps Richie's mom, Maggie, to stop Henry from testifying against him. Weems turns himself in to Cutrona so he would let Maggie go; instead, they plan to kill him. As they are about to execute Weems in the basement (where Maggie is also being held), Cutrona and his mobster partner, Dominic, are killed in a bizarre turn of events, whereas Weems and Maggie are unharmed as Mulder arrives with backup. In the end, it turns out by surprise that Cutrona is an organ donor and a perfect match for Richie, who gets the treatment and lives. Weems then activates a toy Goldberg machine that he made for Richie earlier.|$|E
