5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

25|$|The NDP's {{strategy}} {{had changed}} in that they were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004, where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure, prompting some criticism from Paul Martin. Andrew Coyne suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, {{but also because the}} Liberals were likely <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals' strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight.|$|E

[...] Most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most investment banks and it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> for firms under a RICO indictment.

500|$|In 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, B. L. van der Waerden, {{arrived at}} the University of Göttingen. He {{immediately}} began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was [...] "absolute beyond comparison". In 1931 he published Moderne Algebra, a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition [...] "based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether". She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> for her ideas, helping them develop their careers {{at the expense of}} her own.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, a {{provision}} {{was added to}} the LCFS that allows refiners <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credits</b> for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar steam generation. Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery is a form of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology. CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credits</b> for deploying innovative crude production technologies.|$|R
500|$|Major League Baseball {{recognizes the}} player or players in each league {{with the most}} wins each season. In baseball, wins are a {{statistic}} used to evaluate pitchers. Credit for a win is given by the official scorer to the pitcher whose team takes and maintains the lead while he is the pitcher of record. If a game is tied or if the lead changes to the other team, all pitchers who have participated and exited the game to that point are unable <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> for the victory. A starting pitcher is ineligible for the win if he has not completed five or more innings of the game; instead, the scorer would award the victory to the relief pitcher who was [...] "most effective... in the official scorer's judgment".|$|E
500|$|Track six is [...] "Simple Man", {{originally}} {{performed by}} Graham Nash for his debut album, Songs for Beginners (1971). Written about an individual getting over a bad relationship, Nash wrote the song immediately after {{breaking up with}} his then-girlfriend Joni Mitchell. David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars" [...] is the seventh track, also written by Bowie. During an interview with Playboy in 1975, Bowie was asked what he thought regarding Streisand's cover; disappointed, he claimed that it was [...] "bloody awful" [...] and [...] "atrocious". The preceding track ("Since I Don't Have You") was written by seven of the band members from the Skyliners and advertised as a [...] "classic" [...] on ButterFly. [...] "Crying Time" [...] and [...] "Let the Good Times Roll" [...] finish off the record, serving as the ninth and tenth tracks, respectively. The former song was written by Buck Owens, originally performed by Ray Charles, and previously recorded by Streisand during a live television special called Barbra Streisand…and Other Musical Instruments in 1973. Author Francis David compared Streisand's vocal capabilities on the track to those of Aretha Franklin's. Meanwhile, [...] "Let the Good Times Roll" [...] is a cover of the 1956 Shirley & Lee original. Written by Leonard Lee and Shirley Goodman, Goodman does not receive a writing credit on the album's official liner notes and would later take Lee to federal court <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E
500|$|Also at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson {{noted that}} there were still [...] "a couple pickup shoots" [...] {{to do for the}} film to [...] "clarify the logic". Further content for the film's {{training}} sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences [...] "loved [...] and wanted more". Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August. Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes, which Derrickson described as [...] "script analysis and dialogue work", not enough <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>credit</b> in the film. Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to [...] "give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts." [...] Before the film's sets were demolished, [...] director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was [...] "kind of perfect" [...] to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene. A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel. Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and [...] "kept throwing lines at" [...] Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film. Additional options Gunn filmed included: Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being [...] "totally crazy"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character [...] "HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in {{the final version of the}} film, but ended up being too long for the scene. By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.|$|E

Her innocent mirth was called licentiousness, and the royal splendour which she had been taught to maintain, was looked upon as iniquitous extravagance.
