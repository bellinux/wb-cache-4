5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> unpredictability {{so it can}} be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, was designed to be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} of the Prometheus descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art {{director}} Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in Alien. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in Alien, but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the Prometheus, and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.|$|E
25|$|Blanchett {{is married}} to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in 1996 {{on the set of}} a TV show and were married on 29 December 1997. Blanchett and Upton have four children: {{biological}} sons Dashiell John (b. December 2001), Roman Robert (b. April 2004), and Ignatius Martin (b. April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed in March 2015. Blanchett said {{that she and her husband}} had been wanting to adopt ever since the birth of their first child. After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} Wittgenstein's {{work is that}} for some term or utterance <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> it must be conceivable that it be doubted. For Wittgenstein, tautologies do not have sense, do not say anything, and so do not admit of doubt. But furthermore, if any other sort of utterance does not admit of doubt, it must be senseless. Rush Rhees, in his notes on lectures given by Wittgenstein, while discussing the reality of physical objects, has him say: ...|$|R

25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E

30|$|Different from 47, 48 conveys enough {{information}} because the focus associate in the sentence is differentials {{rather than the}} relation of superiority.

40|$|In {{this article}} on the social {{processes}} of integration in adolescents and youth, we describe and explain the factors which, in {{a representative sample of}} 413 immigrant adolescents in Huelva, Spain, are linked <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging <b>to</b> Spain. Approximately fifty percent of those interviewed reported <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging to Spain, although the degree of belonging to this country was lower or non-existent in other cases. This paper attempts to delimit the elements that largely explain the degree of the sense of belonging to a country, which is crucial to understanding the processes of identificative integration. We found several variables linked to the sense of belonging to Spain: life satisfaction, structural opportunities perceived in Spain, orientation towards the Spanish language (monolingual or bilingual), multiple territorial identification, participation in Spanish celebrations and activities, and trust in Spanish people...|$|R

500|$|In {{preparation}} for his composition, Wall studied Miller's music, {{noting that he}} and Miller differed on their use of music theory. Miller, according to Wall, felt that [...] "melody could easily {{get in the way}} of the experience of playing the game", but Wall felt that some melody provided something thematic for the player to grasp. Wall wanted the music <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> purpose while still preserving interactivity, so he composed [...] "reward music" [...] for completing puzzles and recorded the score with a real orchestra.|$|E

500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, achondroplasia, {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs. While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor", to know [...] "that it's not your problem. It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know what I would say. Everyone's different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended the}} game <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater <b>sense</b> of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains {{known as the}} Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.|$|R

500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Takashi Hasegawa, who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia; Koki Matsumoto, who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia; Hideo Baba, who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth; and Takaaki Okuda, a newcomer to the series. The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star shining on the land, similar to Venus in the evening sky. The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> justice that did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs. One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other. A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede, who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura.|$|E
2500|$|The {{episode was}} criticised by Irish viewers for {{depicting}} Irish stereotypes such as drinking Guinness and whisky chasers in pubs, and the Irish cast {{were accused of}} putting on [...] "over-the-top" [...] Irish accents. Oisin Stack defended the show, saying, [...] "It's a psychological thriller that's meant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> suspense. Everything {{is meant to be}} heightened. I think if people are giving out about the realism, they're missing the point of the genre. It's meant to be stylised and filled with dramatic suspense." ...|$|E
500|$|Whales are {{not thought}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good <b>sense</b> of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. [...] However, some toothed whales have {{preferences}} between {{different kinds of}} fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste. The presence of the Jacobson's organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth, which might {{be similar to the}} sensation of taste.|$|R

2500|$|Lindeman {{states that}} social motives (i.e., [...] "to {{comprehend}} {{self and the}} world, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often [...] "more easily" [...] fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information. Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially. Operating within {{a different set of}} rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is [...] "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{has gone}} on record saying [...] "I {{like the idea of}} {{preserving}} at least a little shred of mystery and making the band to be more an entity—without hopefully sounding too pretentious – as a work of art [...] ". [...] Turner has also {{said in an interview in}} New Zealand music magazine Rip It Up that [...] "we don't want to hand-feed everything to the listener. We just want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mystery". There is a definite attitude that art and music are interchangeable and synonymous to the band; he feels that [...] "the songwriting and the artwork come from the same place". This logic relates to visual and aural aspects as well as overt intellectualisation, through literary references and driving philosophies. Books such as Don Quixote, House of Leaves, Labyrinths and the philosophies of Jeremy Bentham have all played a role in shaping the themes of Isis' releases.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike his {{comic book}} counterpart, Snake Eyes {{did not play}} a major role in the Sunbow's [...] TV series, with the {{exception}} of the first miniseries [...] "The M.A.S.S. Device", where some of his origins were explored. He was always portrayed as a trusted and loyal teammate, and even proved <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor, as seen when he broke into a break-dancing routine on-stage, and later in a disguise resembling Boy George in the [...] "Pyramid of Darkness" [...] miniseries. In the first miniseries, Snake Eyes appeared in his [...] "V1" [...] uniform, but for all of his later appearances he wore a bluish-grey version of his [...] "V2" [...] uniform. Additionally, he does not have a rivalry with Storm Shadow in the cartoon, who instead fights with such characters as Spirit and Quick Kick. Although Snake Eyes does not speak, the vocal effects of Snake Eyes' wolf Timber were provided by Frank Welker.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Yorkshire has {{developed}} over the county's history, influenced by the cultures of those who came to control the region, including the Celts (Brigantes and Parisii), Romans, Angles, Vikings and Normans.

50|$|Consciousness is {{the quality}} or state of being aware of an {{external}} object or something within oneself.

30|$|Conversely, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{plan for}} the future is {{positively}} associated with economic attachments to both country of origin (remitting every month) and the host country (own a home) and to the socio-cultural attachments (high degree of approval for Italian lifestyle, frequent use of Italian at home and (though only for men) <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> network with more Italians).

2500|$|The {{basic premise}} of Confucianism {{is the idea}} that human beings are {{fundamentally}} good. [...] With this optimistic view on human potential, Confucius advocates for ruling through li – traditional customs, mores, and norms – which allow people <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> shame and become humane people with good character, rather than through government regulations and penal law. [...] The idea is that people will internalize the acceptable norms and only take proper actions. [...] This will not only lead to a harmonious social order, but it will also provide the additional benefit of improving an individual’s inner character and the overall quality of the society. [...] In contrast, codified laws require external compliance, and people may abide by the laws without fully understanding the reason for compliance. [...] As such, a social order achieved through formal laws does not come with the additional benefit of better citizenry. [...] It is worth noting, however, that even Confucius did not advocate for the elimination of formal laws. [...] Rather, according to Confucius, laws should be used minimally and reserved only for those that insist on pursuing one’s self-interests without taking into account the well being of the society.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{publication}} {{took place}} in Spencer, Indiana, and upon its release was shipped to retail chains such as Fry's Electronics, Egghead Software and CompUSA. The design of the game cover closely mimicked that of the Windows 95 packaging. During development, Parroty Interactive had planned to promote the game at the COMDEX computer expo by Fall in 1997. The presentation was to include a Bill Gates lookalike. However the staff were expelled by security from the convention and the distribution plan was shut down. Despite this setback, the company presented their product at the Macworld expo in Silicon Valley, San Francisco next January, receiving praise from Macintosh users. At the event they demoed the CEO-themed Tamagotchi spoof [...] "Billagotchi", and [...] "Windows Exploder" [...] game where players blows away error messages. CD copies of the game were sold in a booth for $20 each. Microsoft also debuted some new products at Macworld such as Office 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0. While noting that he was yet to examine the Palladium Interactive title, Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray commented that [...] "ours are probably a little more serious" [...] than Microshaft Winblows 98, and that the corporation [...] "tr <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor about this sort of thing".|$|E
2500|$|Confident {{of having}} been given free hand by French Premier Pierre Laval, and certain that the British and French would be {{forgiving}} because of his opposition to Hitler's revisionism within the Stresa front, Mussolini received with disdain the League of Nations' economic sanctions imposed on Italy by initiative of London and Paris. In Mussolini's view, the move was a typically hypocritical action carried out by decaying imperial powers that intended to prevent the natural expansion of younger and poorer nations like Italy. In fact, although France and Britain had already colonized parts of Africa, the Scramble for Africa had finished {{by the beginning of}} the twentieth century. The international mood was now against colonialist expansion and Italy's actions were condemned. Furthermore, Italy was criticized for its use of mustard gas and phosgene against its enemies and also for its zero tolerance approach to enemy guerrillas, authorized by Mussolini. Between 1936–1941 during operations to [...] "pacify" [...] Ethiopia, the Italians killed hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian civilians, and are estimated to have killed about 7% of Ethiopia's total population. Mussolini ordered Marshal Rodolfo Graziani [...] "to initiate and systematically conduct a policy of terror and extermination against the rebels and the population in complicity with them. Without a policy of ten eyes to one, we cannot heal this wound in good time". Mussolini personally ordered Graziani to execute the entire male population over the age of 18 in one town and in one district ordered that [...] "the prisoners, their accomplices and the uncertain will have to be executed" [...] as part of the [...] "gradual liquidation" [...] of the population. Believing the Eastern Orthodox Church was inspiring Ethiopians to resist, Mussolini ordered that Orthodox priests and monks were to be targeted in revenge for guerrilla attacks. Mussolini brought in Degree Law 880, which made miscegenation a crime punishable with five years in prison as Mussolini made it absolutely clear that he did not want his soldiers and officials serving in Ethiopia to ever have sex with Ethiopian women under any circumstances as he believed that multiracial relationships made his men less likely to kill Ethiopians. Mussolini favored a policy of brutality partly because he believed the Ethiopians were not a nation because black people were too stupid <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nationality and therefore the guerrillas were just [...] "bandits". The other reason was because Mussolini was planning on bringing millions of Italian colonists into Ethiopia and he needed to kill off much of the Ethiopian population to make room for the Italian colonists just as he had done in Libya.|$|E
