5|$|A revival can be {{identified}} by {{the dedication of the}} first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site's first ballcourt.|$|E
5|$|A second station, {{later called}} Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath {{extension}} of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.

5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their housekeeper {{had lived in the}} Leslie Mansion (the mansion on the property). The mansion was over a hundred years old, was a frame building, had very few rooms, provided poor living conditions, and had a water pump at the main entrance.|$|E

To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock Signal Tower – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing {{the history of the}} lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E

5|$|Control {{of water}} {{was the primary}} concern in <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam. Power {{generation}} has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds {{from the sale of}} power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multimillion-dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1160s, Foliot {{also served as}} a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, but left the archbishop's service as Becket's dispute with the king began to intensify. He was elected to Hereford in 1173, and served as a royal and papal judge while bishop. Archeological {{evidence}} links <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bishop's Palace at Hereford to his episcopate. After his death, Foliot was buried in Hereford Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{policies}} {{led to the}} GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GTP {{that they did not}} agree to. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Tonbridge Priory was {{demolished}} to {{make way}} for <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first railway station.

In 1849, Somerhill was bought by Sir Isaac Goldsmid, who passed it on to his son Frederick in 1859.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Goss, then bishop, {{awarded the}} {{commission}} for <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833–1875). By 1856 the Lady chapel {{of the new}} cathedral had been completed. Due to financial resources being diverted {{to the education of}} Catholic children, work on the building ceased at this point and the Lady chapel now named Our Lady Immaculate served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million {{donation}} led to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, {{which became}} the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979.|$|E
