5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal <b>times</b> <b>is</b> a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E

An alternative, or perhaps secondary, usage for the causeway in Roman <b>times</b> <b>is</b> suggested by landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state {{that it may}} have been constructed for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating that the value of jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction.|$|E

5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical <b>times</b> <b>is</b> apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E

5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata.

5|$|The {{male and}} female {{dichotomy}} of polar opposites with the former oppressing the latter at all <b>times</b> <b>is</b> refuted in the Indian context because it was men who initiated social reform movements against various social evils.

Not all women are powerless at all times.|$|E

40|$|The <b>time</b> can <b>be</b> {{viewed from}} two aspects: {{objective}} and subjective one. Objective <b>time</b> <b>is</b> that which exist in itself, outside {{of man and}} independently of him. In its relationship to events happening in it <b>time</b> <b>is</b> physical, cosmic, astronomic, zoological, biological and athropological. The <b>time</b> <b>is</b> part cyclical but in whole, and especially in anthropology, it <b>is</b> linear. Subjective <b>time</b> <b>is</b> that feeling of <b>time</b> which <b>is</b> experienced by the man himsef or herself. It is sensed in the biorhythm and psychorhythm of every human being. Psychological <b>time</b> <b>is</b> molded from the primary childhood {{to the end of}} life and flies short or dilatory in accordance with subjective dispositions. In this manner <b>time</b> <b>is</b> part of human internal structure and lives in man as a regulator of his development...|$|R

5|$|Between 1961 and 1989, when Real {{dominated}} La Liga, only Atlético {{offered it}} any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977.

Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013.
