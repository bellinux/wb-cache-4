5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of offending Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E

5|$|Unternehmen Paula (Undertaking or Operation Paula) is the German codename {{given for}} the Second World War Luftwaffe {{offensive}} operation to destroy the remaining units of the Armée de l'Air (ALA), or French Air Force during the Battle of France in 1940.

To complete the defeat of France, the Germans undertook a second phase operation, Fall Rot (Case Red), to conquer the remaining regions. In order to do this, air supremacy was required.

5|$|The {{deployment}} {{plan for}} 2nd Army Group saw the 1st Army in the Bačka region between the Danube and the Tisza, with formations centred around {{the towns of}} Sombor, Bačka Topola and Senta, with the 3rd Cavalry Division held in depth, south of the Danube in the Fruška Gora region. The 2nd Army deployment plan {{saw it in the}} Baranya and Slavonia regions between Slatina and the Danube, with its formations positioned south of the Drava from just east of Slatina to Valpovo, and around the towns of Osijek and Vinkovci. Of <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Army Group, two infantry divisions of the 2nd Army were partly mobilised, while the remaining two infantry divisions, the 3rd Cavalry Division, and the two brigade-strength infantry detachments had only commenced mobilisation. To the right of the 1st Army Group was the 6th Army, an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav Banat region east of the Tisza. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the Sava through Obrenovac. On the left flank of the 2nd Army Group was the 1st Army Group, which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, along the Yugoslav–Hungarian west of Slatina, Yugoslav–Reich and Yugoslav–Italian borders. The army group boundary ran from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka.|$|E

The formation of non-lamellar phases is significant in biomedical studies which include drug delivery, the transport of polar and non-polar ions using solvents capable of penetrating the biomembrane, increasing the elasticity of the biomembrane when it is being disrupted by unwanted substances (viruses, bacteria, solvents, etc.) and functioning as a channel or transporter of biomaterial.|$|E

25|$|There are two geochemical {{classes of}} komatiite; {{aluminium}} undepleted komatiite (AUDK) (also known as Group I komatiites) and aluminium depleted komatiite (ADK) (also known as Group II komatiites), defined by their Al2O3/TiO2 ratios. These {{two classes of}} komatiite are often assumed to represent a real petrological source {{difference between the two}} types related to depth of melt generation. Al-depleted komatiites have been modeled by melting experiments as being produced by high degrees of partial melting at high pressure where garnet in the source is not melted, whereas Al-undepleted komatiites are produced by high degrees of partial melts at lesser depth. However, recent studies of fluid inclusions in chrome spinels from the cumulate zones of komatiite flows have shown that a single komatiite flow can be derived from the mixing of parental magmas with a range of Al2O3/TiO2 ratios, calling into question this interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> the different komatiite groups.
