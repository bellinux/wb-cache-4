5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E

25|$|Rendezvous {{in orbit}} {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed {{to catch up with}} another, the result is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other. To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} edition of Richard Elliott Friedman's book Who Wrote the Bible?, in which he {{explained}} and defended the documentary hypothesis, he put forth {{the claim that the}} Deuteronomist, who is generally thought to have either written or edited the books from Deuteronomy to II Kings, was Baruch ben Neriah. He defended this assertion by comparing a number of different phrases in the Book of Jeremiah with phrases in other books. Some reject this claim on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> beyond the evidence.|$|E
25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> against the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE. It is also being argued by the opposers that the irreparable damage caused during the childhood of the individual, cannot be rectified at a later stage. Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically poor is highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root cause of the problem. Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of general category students do not complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students. This is used as an {{argument against}} reservations claiming that the reserved class candidates are not adequately prepared to face the challenging academic life in IITs.|$|E
25|$|The Nochiya Tribes {{territory}} {{is unique in}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through three different countries: Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. The {{reason for this is}} because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to how the United States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the Battle of Chaldiran split the Targawar, Bagzadeh and Margawar Clans away from the central Şemdinli district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the Zagros mountain range {{in the eastern part of}} their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.|$|E

25|$|The Kyoto Protocol is {{the most}} {{prominent}} international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> too far or not nearly far enough in restricting emissions of greenhouse gases. Another area of controversy {{is the fact that}} China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita, they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of e and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of e respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita e emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of e. Nevertheless, China is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and India 4th (see: countries by greenhouse emissions). Various predictions see China overtaking the US in total greenhouse emissions between late 2007 and 2010, and according to many other estimates, this already occurred in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{gave the}} book a starred review, stating, [...] "This subtle, {{brilliant}} {{examination of the}} period between the War of Independence and the Louisiana Purchase puts Pulitzer-winner Ellis (Founding Brothers) among the finest of America's narrative historians." [...] Jon Meacham, reviewing the book for The New York Times, called the book [...] "illuminating", writing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> [...] "beyond the familiar critique of the founding to explore a point that remains underappreciated: that America was constructed to foster arguments, not to settle them". Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times also praised the book, writing that [...] "It is Ellis's achievement that he leaves us with a keen appreciation of the good fortune America had in having the right men {{in the right places}} at the right times".|$|E

On July 22, 2010, the music video was [...] released on Aguilera's VEVO channel. Two days before the release, a sneak peek of the music video was revealed. According to Billboard writer Monica Herrera, the clip contrasts with the music video for the [...] lead single of Bionic [...] "Not Myself Tonight", while Chris Ryan for MTV Buzzworthy thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> [...] "back to basics".|$|E

The Ventura County Reporters Matthew Singer thought it was [...] "overflowing with great individual scenes", particularly Troy McClure's Meat Council propaganda video, which he said [...] "may be the funniest isolated segment {{in the history of}} the show". MSNBC's Patrick Enright, who listed the episode as his second favorite of the series, highlighted the [...] "You don't win friends with salad!"

[...] The song also contains influences of disco, opening with a [...] "summer-y disco guitar" [...] before moving into [...] "hands-in-the-air synth blasts" [...] as a critic for Vice magazine described. The pitch shifting of the samples was influenced by the works of Jay Dilla. The song's composition and arrangement was compared by Spin magazine's Garrett Kamps to the works of Boards of Canada, while other listeners compared the track's use of soul samples to that of [...] "The Glory," [...] a track from Kanye West's third album Graduation (2007).|$|E
500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end.

500|$|An {{aspect of}} {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express which received largely negative reactions was the repetitive nature of many tasks the player must complete. 2404 accused {{the game of}} reducing Christie's novel, and the game, {{into a series of}} repetitive and secretarial tasks, such as collecting fingerprints, passports, and other random items. The site further {{went on to say that}} the player is made to feel [...] "like a secretary for Poirot." [...] Game Over Online agreed with this view, saying that much of the game consisted of [...] "goofy little errands" [...] such as completing tasks for characters and mindlessly searching for objects. Eurogamer provides an example of this, by saying that at one point in the game the player is required to go through each cabin checking the shoe sizes of the various passengers' shoes to check if one matches shoe prints outside the train. The inventory system featured in Murder on the Orient Express has also received significant criticism. IGN complained that instead of being able to find item combinations through trial and error in the main screen, the player is forced to drag items to a separate screen, leading to tedious gameplay. Some reviewers, in contrast, praised the inventory system, with Quandary calling it intuitive, and easy for players to organize. The puzzles in Murder on the Orient Express received positive responses from some reviewers. GameSpot commented favourably on the relatively small number of puzzles in the game, saying that they are integrated fairly well within the plot, and are not excessively difficult. The review went on to say that later puzzles in the game often rely more heavily on inventory combinations, but are still reasonably satisfying to solve. Game Over Online, in comparison, accused the game of giving the player too little information to solve puzzles, and also called the puzzles convoluted. The choice of the developers of Murder on the Orient Express to use Antoinette Marceau, rather than Poirot, as the protagonist and player character was criticized by some. 2404 disapproved of the choice, accusing the developers of not fully utilizing the talent of David Suchet, arguably the most famous and successful portrayer of Poirot. The reviewer even went so far as to tell AWE Productions to [...] "make use of talent like David Suchet when you've got it." [...] Like its predecessor, Murder on the Orient Express was criticized for diverging from Christie's original ending. Adventure Gamers called the new ending [...] "a little too contrived for the game's good." [...] 2404 also disapproved of the ending, commenting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> off in too much of a Hollywood direction, and that the original ending is much better and a far more satisfying conclusion.|$|E
