25|$|In the Test arena, Taylor's {{performances}} were somewhat below {{what one would}} expect of a player at Test level. However, this was attributed to his young age and premature elevation to the national team. However, since Zimbabwe's return to the <b>Test</b> <b>circuit,</b> Taylor has shown remarkable maturity, both as the side's leading batsman and captain. He scored two Test centuries and when he scored a century in the fourth innings of the Test match against New Zealand, on a fifth day pitch, (inclusive of 5 huge sixes), he became the second Zimbabwean after Arnott to score a fourth-innings century in a Test match. Taylor has announced that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. He also scored two half-centuries, 71 against Bangladesh and 50 against New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{initiated}} in the Organic Electronics group at Linköping University within a project called ‘Brains & Bricks’. The {{purpose was to}} develop a prototype of a wireless humidity sensor with a solid polyelectrolyte as the humidity sensing material. The humidity levels can be estimated from the resonant frequency of a <b>testing</b> <b>circuit.</b> The readings were performed by a wireless method between two coils. Both the <b>testing</b> <b>circuit</b> and the simulation programs were designed in this thesis work. The operating frequency of the sensor was chosen to be in the range of 100 kHz to 200 kHz at which the solid polyelectrolyte, Polystyrene Sulfonic Acid (PSSH), was sensitive to humidity variations. Three different types of humidity sensors were fabricated and tested. These sensor heads promised for printability and low-cost manufacturing. A shift, responding to a humidity variation, in the resonant frequency of the <b>testing</b> <b>circuit</b> was detected by a reader coil which was 1 cm away from a sensor coil. These measurements matched the results simulated by a Matlab program. The feasibility of fabricating a low-cost wireless humidity sensor with a solid polyelectrolyte as humidity sensing material by printing technique was proved in the thesis work. Subsequent research will be continued to develop humidity sensors having a lateral structure and an improved performance...|$|R
