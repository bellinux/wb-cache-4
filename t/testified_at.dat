5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Frank, now entirely across Fremont {{street and}} still walking {{at a good}} pace {{according}} to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before {{he was shot in}} the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, as {{a result}} of the {{declarations}} of Di Carlo, the judicial inquiry was reopened. In April 2006, more than 35 years after De Mauro’s disappearance, the trial on his murder started at the Court of Palermo with the former Mafia boss of bosses Riina as the only remaining defendant. (D'Agostino and Bontate were killed by Riina’s Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War; Badalamenti died in a US prison in April 2004.) In 2011 the new Mafia turncoat Naimo <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the trial saying that the journalist was killed by the Mafia on the orders of Riina.|$|E

5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a number of American POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E

She <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> a Meese Commission hearing on pornography, while Attorney General Edwin Meese was serving socially conservative President Reagan.

5|$|The United States Department of Justice was {{investigating}} the company's practices {{at the time}} and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam’s testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam’s manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.|$|E

5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|By April 1944, Göth {{had been}} {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain), having received a double promotion, skipping the rank of SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant). He was also appointed a reserve officer of the Waffen-SS. In early 1944 the status of the Kraków-Płaszów Labour Camp changed to a permanent concentration camp under the direct authority of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (WVHA; SS Economics and Administration Office). Mietek Pemper <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the trial that it was during the earlier period that Göth committed most of the random and brutal killings for which he became notorious. Concentration camps were more closely monitored by the SS than labour camps, so conditions improved slightly when the designation was changed.|$|E

Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet {{apparently}} never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had stolen the food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E
5|$|The Zagros Mountains {{have been}} {{occupied}} {{since at least}} the Lower Palaeolithic, and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave. Historical records for the region are available {{from the end of the}} third millennium BCE onward. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud. The Battle of the Zab – which ended the Umayyad Caliphate – took place near a tributary of the Great Zab, and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Great Zab basin saw frequent uprisings of local Kurdish tribes striving for autonomy.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, {{not only because of}} his {{position}} but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in an old man. In February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague's corruption.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt {{said in his}} {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen {{through the prism of}} domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton <b>testified</b> <b>at</b> an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E
