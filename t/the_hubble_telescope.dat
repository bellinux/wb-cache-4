5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope</b> have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope</b> to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope.</b> Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E

50|$|In {{celebration of}} the 25th anniversary since the launch of <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space <b>Telescope,</b> astronomers {{assembled}} a larger and higher-resolution photograph of the Pillars of Creation, which was unveiled in January 2015 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle. The image was photographed by <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>Telescope's</b> Wide Field Camera 3, installed in 2009, and produced using near-infrared and visible light exposure.|$|R
50|$|Mission was {{intended}} to deploy <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space <b>Telescope</b> into orbit. <b>The</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space <b>Telescope,</b> {{and most of the}} previously assigned crew (except Young, who was replaced by Loren Shriver), would eventually fly on STS-31 in 1990.|$|R
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of Â±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>Telescope</b> scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope,</b> and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E

25|$|On 29 September 2008, NASA {{announced}} {{that due to}} a problem with <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope,</b> they would be revising the manifest to postpone STS-125 until 2009, so {{a solution to the}} issue with the telescope could be integrated into the flight plan. This moved STS-126 to the next flight, so on 23 October 2008 Endeavour was moved from launch pad 39B to 39A.|$|E
25|$|Ferris {{believes}} that the Big Bang theory is correct because of microwave background radiation which gives space a temperature of 3 kelvins. <b>The</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope</b> has also shown, through the Doppler effect, that galaxies are moving away in proportion to their distances from earth, which is evident by the redshift caused by lower frequencies generated from their normal frequency radiation.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to the era}} of the Hubble Space Telescope {{and space}} probes {{reaching}} the outer Solar System, attempts to detect satellites around asteroids were limited to optical observations from Earth. For example, in 1978, stellar occultation observations were claimed as evidence of a satellite for the asteroid 532 Herculina. However, later more-detailed imaging by <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>Telescope</b> did not reveal a satellite, and the current consensus is that Herculina does not have a significant satellite. There were other similar reports of asteroids having companions (usually referred to as satellites) in the following years. Also, a letter in Sky & Telescope magazine at this time pointed to apparently simultaneous impact craters on Earth (for example, the Clearwater Lakes in Quebec), suggesting that these craters were caused by pairs of gravitationally-bound objects.|$|E

25|$|Launch is {{scheduled}} for spring 2019 on an Ariane 5 rocket. The observatory attaches to the Ariane 5 rocket via a launch vehicle adapter ring {{which could be used}} by a future spacecraft to grapple the observatory to attempt to fix gross deployment problems. However, the telescope itself is not serviceable, and astronauts {{would not be able to}} perform tasks such as swapping instruments, as with <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>Telescope.</b> Its nominal mission time is five years, with a goal of ten years. JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L2, which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime, and it is being designed to carry enough for ten years. The planned five year science mission begins after a 6-month commissioning phase. An L2 orbit is meta-stable so it requires orbital station-keeping or an object will drift away from this orbital configuration.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Galileo mission, {{astronomers have}} {{continued}} monitoring Io's active volcanoes with adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory in Chile, as well as imaging from <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope.</b> These technologies are used to observe the thermal emissions and measure the composition of gases over volcanoes such as Pele and Tvashtar. Imaging from the Keck telescope in February 2001 revealed the most powerful volcanic eruption observed in modern times, either on Io or on Earth, at the volcano Surt. Earth-based telescopes coming online over the next decade, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory, will provide more-detailed observations of Io's volcanoes, approaching the resolution achieved by Galileos near-IR spectrometer. Hubble ultraviolet, millimeter-wave, and ground-based mid-infrared observations of Io's atmosphere have revealed strong density heterogeneities between bright, frost-covered regions along the satellite's equator and its polar regions, providing further evidence that Ionian atmosphere is supported by the sublimation of sulfur dioxide frost on Io's surface.|$|E

2500|$|One of O'Keefe's most {{controversial}} decisions occurred in January 2004, when he cancelled an upcoming Space Shuttle mission {{to service the}} aging Hubble Space Telescope. O'Keefe claimed that, {{in light of the}} Space Shuttle Columbia accident, the mission would be too risky, since any potential shuttle damage while visiting the Hubble, would mean insufficient fuel to dock with the space station as a [...] "safe haven". While members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) supported this decision numerous astronomers felt that <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>telescope</b> was valuable enough to merit the risk.|$|E
2500|$|The JWST's primary {{scientific}} {{mission has}} four key goals: {{to search for}} light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the Universe after the Big Bang, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, to understand the formation of stars and planetary systems and to study planetary systems and the origins of life. These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason the JWST's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> <b>Telescope,</b> but will have a much greater capacity to perform infrared astronomy. The JWST will be sensitive {{to a range of}} wavelengths from 0.6 (orange light) to 28 micrometers (deep infrared radiation at about [...] ).|$|E
