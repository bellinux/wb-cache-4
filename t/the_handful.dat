5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among <b>the</b> <b>handful</b> of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.|$|E

5|$|As the queen's son Radama grew to adulthood, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{by the high}} death toll of his mother's military campaigns and traditional measures of justice, and was frustrated by her unilateral rejection of European influence. The young prince developed sympathetic relationships with <b>the</b> <b>handful</b> of Europeans permitted by Ranavalona to frequent her court, namely Jean Laborde and Joseph-François Lambert, with whom he privately concluded the lucrative Lambert Charter. The charter, which would come into effect upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted Lambert large tracts of land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, timber harvesting and other activities on the island. In May 1857, when Rainilaiarivony was 29 years old, Lambert consequently invited Prince Radama, Rainivoninahitriniony, Rainilaiarivony {{and a number of}} other officers to conspire with him in a plot to overthrow Ranavalona.|$|E

5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and <b>the</b> <b>handful</b> of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E

Several attacks were repulsed, but because of men leaving their positions L Company's strength dwindled from 100 to 40 men. The remnant of L Company withdrew toward I Company's position on the crest of P'il-bong, only to find that this company under a relatively minor attack had left the hill.

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan as , , and , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra evolves into Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra evolves into Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. Able to remember everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam is also one of <b>the</b> <b>handful</b> of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E

This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E

On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. <b>The</b> <b>handful</b> of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just reached the end of their flour supplies. They began slaughtering <b>the</b> <b>handful</b> of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E

50|$|The cities {{along the}} {{proposed}} route also pushed to prohibit trucks over 4.5 tons (4.0 metric tons) from using SR 85 (similar to the I-580 truck ban in Oakland).

The restriction is legally in effect from SR 85's southern terminus at U.S. Route 101 to Interstate 280 (exit 19B), although current signage permits southbound trucks to travel further to Stevens Creek Boulevard (exit 18). This ban has been a prime factor in reducing the level of noise that the freeway would otherwise produce as most large trucks are unable to use the freeway.|$|R
