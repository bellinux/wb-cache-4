5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E

5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> the hearing.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect.

The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E

Neither view is helpful to make decisions on competing claims: <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> treatment ignores <b>the</b> problem and <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> opportunity holds all claims to be equally valid. To escape this deadlock one needs an external criterion to replace fairness viewed as student-student comparison.

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> on <b>the</b> {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> allocations. We consider {{three different}} notions <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> namely proportionality, envy-freeness, and equitability for allocations of divisible and indivisible goods and chores. We present {{a series of}} results on <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> under <b>the</b> three different notions that quantify the efficiency loss in fair allocations compared to optimal ones. Most of our bounds are either exact or tight within constant factors. Our study is of an optimistic nature and aims to identify <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> in allocations. ...|$|R
40|$|Health care {{resource}} allocation {{is a central}} moral issue in health policy, and opinions about it have been studied extensively. Allocation situations have typically been described and presented in a positive manner (i. e., who should receive medical aid). On the other hand, the negative valence allocation situation (i. e., who should not receive medical aid) has been relatively neglected. This paper demonstrates how positive versus negative framing of the exact same health care {{resource allocation}} situation can affect <b>the</b> perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> allocation principles. Participants usually perceived non-egalitarian principles (i. e., need, equity and tenure) to be fairer in positively framed situations (i. e., to deliver health care resources to certain patients) than negatively framed situation (i. e., not to deliver health care resources to other patients). However, framing did not affect <b>the</b> perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equality principle (i. e., a random draw). The paper offers a theoretical explanation for the effect of framing on <b>the</b> perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> health care resource allocation and discusses implications for both researchers and policy makers. attribute framing, health care resource allocation, perceived fairness. ...|$|R
