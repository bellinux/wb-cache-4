[...] Perry begins singing each verse on the beat ("you think I'm pretty ...") but then falls off it {{before the end of the}} first line ("... makeup on"), syncopating the melody, creating additional tension. [...] "Her lines dovetail elegantly into each other. This contributes to the feeling of suspension <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> above. As listeners, we're waiting for her to get to the point." [...] Pallett says she does indeed do this in the pre-chorus, when she accentuates the imperatives ("Let's go all the way tonight ...") by returning to the beat. Pallett than calls it [...] "genius" [...] that the chorus itself inverts the weighting of the verses, as the line [...] "You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream" [...] goes from off beat to on and then back again, in a single line.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The {{young lady}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to you, my dears, as having {{interested}} me so very much,' remarked Mr Pecksniff. 'Excuse my interrupting you, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} that would be your feeling. <b>I</b> repeat <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> them only because you once said you {{intended}} {{to do something for}} me, as the phrase is, and I thought you oughtn't to do it in ignorance." ...|$|R
3000|$|SR: So it’s kinda narrow, my way {{to answer}} this question. <b>I</b> {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> only <b>mentioned</b> the similarities but not the differences. So <b>I</b> am thinking <b>that</b> maybe if <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> more kinds of the meeting in the beginning, that would really help. (Faye) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye be no outlaws," [...] {{the lady}} {{superior}} said, [...] "for the outlaws are men who fear God {{and respect the}} church. Were ye what ye say, ye would be provided with the warrants <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention.</b> <b>I</b> warn you, therefore, that if you use force, you will be excommunicated, and placed under the ban of the church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to {{you that}} the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of {{security}} unless our doors were locked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{never thought}} of that!" [...] the girl exclaimed. [...] "I am sure he looks honest. It was only because he spoke so well <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've heard that, too, eh?" [...] he muttered. [...] "It {{occurred}} {{to me from the}} first, Chetwode. It certainly did occur to me. You will remember <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening," [...] he said. [...] "Now, madame, let us come to {{business}} at once. You will observe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> no names, but I {{know who is}} in the next room, and what he carries in that valise. That is the point which brings me here. I have come to dictate terms of surrender." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{unfavorable}} impression I {{may have}} produced on you, I dare not inquire. So little capable am I of concealing the vile feelings which sometimes {{get the better}} of me, that Miss Cristel (observe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> her with respect) appears to have felt positive alarm, on your account, when she looked at me.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>I</b> denied; <b>mentioning</b> several {{instances}} in which I had conquered the most intractable tempers among the sex.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! not at all--only {{the number}} of the family, the baker's dozen, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> last evening; now in visiting Miss Henly there is no such {{interruption}} to be apprehended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, your ladyship, that it's worth {{while my}} {{sitting down and}} detaining you, for I--I have not got the letters <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> when I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was then, even then, in {{the hour}} of his desolation, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> your name, that it might the more disgust him; and while he wept over his virtuous and sainted wife, I dwelt on the vices of his {{rejected}} mistress." ...|$|E
6000|$|Is it needful to say <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{what had}} {{occurred}} to Dr McTougall that amiable little man opened his eyes to their widest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the glamour and mystery, I was never half so serious in my life. They are, after all, very real things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In plain words, doctor," [...] I said, [...] "you don't {{think the}} {{circumstances}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> to you worthy of serious investigation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{a letter}} is a spell, I {{think you have}} a spell of mine, which is a spell of my own weaving. You were to show me the letter in which I asked you to come to see me. It was in that, I think you said, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> your debts; but I don't {{remember}} doing so. Show it to me!' ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{how simple}} a thing it seems when done by others. I saw the {{difference}} {{at once the}} very next day, {{the second day of}} my visit, when Beverly-Jones took round young Poppleton, the man <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> above who will presently give a Swiss yodel from a clump of laurel bushes to indicate that the day's fun has begun.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} she was no fool. Behold! As I palpitated to the situation, princess and sea-cuny and love not a little that {{threatened}} big, I racked my cuny's brains for wit to carry the thing off with manhood credit. It chanced, early in this first meeting, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> what I had told all the Court, that I was in truth a Korean of {{the blood of the}} ancient house of Koryu.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{undertake}} to say <b>that,</b> Mr. Dockwrath. <b>I</b> {{think it}} will perhaps be better <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>mention</b> it, and then see you afterwards." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Locke {{argues that}} {{children}} are capable of reasoning at a young age: “It will perhaps be wonder’d, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> reasoning with children; and yet I cannot but think that the true {{way of dealing with}} them. They understand it as early as they do language; and, if I misobserve not, they love to be treated as rational creatures, sooner than is imagin’d,” Rousseau disagreed: “Use force with children and reasoning with men." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hamblin added, [...] "I {{believe if}} the rules <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> were {{observed}} {{there should be}} little difficulty on our frontier with the Red Man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Sir,--In {{the report}} of my speech (which by the bye is given very [...] incorrectly) in the 'M[orning] Herald', 'Day', and 'B[ritish] Press', [...] they state <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> 'Bristol', a place I never saw in my life [...] and knew nothing of whatever, nor 'mentioned' at all last night. Will [...] you {{be good enough to}} send to these 'papers' 'immediately', and have [...] the mistake corrected, or I shall get into a scrape with the Bristol [...] people? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> Linda's name," [...] he protested. [...] "She went to bed soon after tea in an {{absolutely}} hopeless state. I am afraid that to-night I was selfish. I was thinking of myself. I have had nothing {{in the shape of}} companionship all day. I came and looked at the table, and the thought of dining alone wearied me. I have to {{spend a great deal of}} time alone, unfortunately. You and I are, perhaps, a little alike in that respect." ...|$|E
60|$|Here we parted {{with the}} first Chilian <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned,</b> and I ordered one of my midshipmen {{to give him a}} hat, and a piece of black baize, enough to make him a cloak, which so obliged the man that he knew not what way to testify his joy; but I knew what I was doing in this, and I ordered my {{midshipman}} to do it that he might make his acquaintance with him against another time, and it was not a gift ill bestowed, as will appear in its place.|$|E
60|$|At dinner <b>that</b> evening <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to {{my father}} the episode of the three Buddhist priests, and found, as <b>I</b> had expected, <b>that</b> {{he was very much}} {{interested}} by my account of them.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> wish now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>mentioned</b> it. It {{would have}} been better for [...] both of us. I should have been saved much pain, and you, perhaps, [...] some uneasiness.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I want to trace briefly how Franz Kafka reacted to some salient {{cultural}} features of his time. I will select segments of his writings which I believe reflect his view, or even his {{characterization of the}} three main historical periods he lived through: pre-World War I, the war years 1914 to 1918, and five and {{one half of the}} postwar years. Of course, this {{is by no means a}} complete, thorough discussion of those periods and his works <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins' prescription, but {{you will}} {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> an empty box of bromide powders. One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes, and cause it {{to be taken in}} the last dose. You will learn later that the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp's medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed.|$|E
60|$|There are {{degrees of}} grace in the world, some have less, and some bigger {{measures}} thereof, {{and according to}} the measure of grace received, so is a Christian capable of action. He that has little, acts but weakly; he that has much, acts more strongly; and he of the saints that has most, acteth best of all: but yet none of these three can act so as they should and would, and, consequently, so depart from iniquity as is their duty. Witness those four <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> but now, for they are among the first-rate of saints, yet you see what they did, and hear what they said.|$|E
6000|$|The library scheme <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to you {{is already}} begun under the {{direction}} of Captain Riddel. There is another in emulation of it going on at Closeburn, under the auspices of Mr. Monteith of Closeburn, which will be on a greater scale than ours. Captain Riddel gave his infant society a great many of his old books, else I had written you on that subject; but, one of these days, I shall trouble you with a commission for [...] "The Monkland Friendly Society," [...] a copy of The Spectator, Mirror, and Lounger, Man of Feeling, Man of the World, Guthrie's Geographical Grammar, with some religious pieces, will likely be our first order.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{would any}} lord of a manor refuse to allow forty yards in breadth out of <b>that</b> road <b>I</b> <b>mentioned,</b> {{to have the}} other twenty made into a firm, fair, and {{pleasant}} causeway over that wilderness of a country? ...|$|R
30|$|As a {{preliminary}} note, all remarks concerning the feedback and reaction of students during the workshop <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will <b>mention</b> here come from personal notes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took during the discussions. Therefore, no {{quotes from the}} participants are provided.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} tell me," [...] I said, in surprise, [...] "how you knew <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> am sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never <b>mentioned</b> the fact to any one, and the wiring was a rush order not {{completed}} until this morning." ...|$|R
