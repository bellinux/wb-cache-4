25|$|General {{classification}} leader Michael Rasmussen {{was expected}} to lose {{a great deal of}} time, having had one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> trials ever for a top-flight professional in the 2005 Tour de France. He finished 11th originally, much better than expected, and was upgraded to 10th when Vinokourov was disqualified, though his own premature exit from the Tour days later casts doubt on this performance.|$|E
25|$|Many {{military}} {{historians have}} pointed out that Westmoreland became chief of staff at <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> in history with regard to the Army. Guiding the Army as it transitioned to an all-volunteer force, he issued many directives to try to make Army life better and more palatable for United States youth—e.g., allowing soldiers to wear sideburns and to drink beer in the mess hall. However, many hard-liners scorned these as too liberal. Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of South Carolina in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{during the}} summer months can be challenging. Courses {{students}} have taken at their old schools may not fulfill the graduation requirements at their new school. Moving during the winter holidays or mid-year, however, has traditionally been viewed as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> to move. The student is forced to join classes that have already begun. Social groups become even more difficult to break into, and activities that the student enjoyed may be barred to him or her. For example, an athlete {{may not be able to}} join his or her sport because they missed tryouts and the season had already begun. A student who excelled at their old DoDDS or DDESS school suddenly feels inadequate at the larger school. Recent studies, however, show that mobility during the school year may be less traumatic than summertime moves.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, Krugman {{published}} a substantial updating {{of an earlier}} work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. In the book, he discusses {{the failure of the}} United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.|$|E
500|$|What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> in my whole life".|$|E

In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time.

500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Let's All Chant" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} with [...] "Love Express" [...] as a B-side in December 1977, on Christmas week. Zager thought it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> to release the single because many artists usually released their albums during this period and thought the single would only become a [...] "disco hit". However, the single became an unexpected smash hit. It climbed to {{number one on the}} disco chart on February 18, 1978, knocking Cerrone's [...] "Supernature" [...] off the top spot, and remained atop the chart for one week, before being toppled by Bionic Boogie's [...] "Dance Little Dreamer". In the US, [...] "Let's All Chant" [...] also charted at number 15 on the Soul Singles chart, number 25 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles, number 31 on the Record World and number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100.

500|$|Between {{the years}} 1970 and 2012, Shoshone National Forest {{averaged}} 25 fires annually, of which half {{were due to}} natural ignition from lightning, which accounted for 90percent of the total acreage burned. The remaining acreage that burned was due to campfires that got out of control or from other causes. In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of [...] burns annually, with the worst year {{in the past century}} being 1988, when [...] burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the Yellowstone region fires of 1988, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a controlled burn plans to reduce the chances of a catastrophic fire. The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of bark beetle may have a great impact on future forest fires. Fire managers have stated <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> for increased fire activity is 1–2years after the trees are killed and then again after the trees have fallen many years later.|$|E

500|$|MacArthur {{accelerated}} his timetable {{yet again}} in September 1944, and brought forward the planned invasion of Leyte to October 1944. That this was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> {{of the year}} for campaigning on Leyte was not overlooked. Typhoons and heavy rains hampered the efforts to construct and rehabilitate airbases, and without them, large numbers of aircraft could not operate from Leyte. This meant not only that few air strikes could be flown in support of the Sixth Army, but that the Allied Air Forces could not prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Leyte. An additional five Japanese divisions and two mixed brigades were sent to Leyte, and the battle became one of grinding attrition. Able to view his troops in action more often than hitherto, Krueger found much to criticize. He noted that tanks were employed poorly, that the infantry were not aggressive enough, and saw poor sanitation and meals as a sign that officers were not taking adequate care of their men. Krueger's generalship has also been questioned, with Ronald Spector criticizing [...] "Krueger's disastrous decision to delay the push into the mountains west of Carigara in favor of beach defense." [...] Krueger based his cautious appreciation of the situation on various intelligence sources rather than relying solely on Ultra.|$|E

2500|$|When {{nearly half}} of Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the Cheka sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but they were {{captured}} and, after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 the Free Territory – Makhnovist region – was inundated with Red troops, including the 42nd Rifle Division and the Latvian & Estonian Division – in total at least 20,000 soldiers. Viktor Belash noted that even in <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>time</b> for the revolutionary army, namely {{at the beginning of}} 1920, [...] "In the majority of cases rank-and-file Red Army soldiers were set free". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release [...] "in all four directions" [...] captured Red Army soldiers. This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in Huliaipole. To this it must be added that the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine included a choir of Estonian musicians. The problem was further compounded by the alienation of the Estonians by Anton Denikin's inflexible Russian chauvinism and their refusal to fight with Nikolai Yudenich.|$|E
