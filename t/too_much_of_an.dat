5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effort.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 {{one of the}} U.S. Senate {{seats for}} Delaware became vacant and the Union Republicans in the Delaware General Assembly {{attempted}} to electing Addicks. Although {{they did not have}} enough votes to do so, the Union Republicans were able to block the election of any other candidate. Because of this deadlock, the seat remained vacant for four years. When the other Senate seat came open in 1901, it too was left vacant due to the deadlock. Finally, in 1903, the matter became national news and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment. Addicks relented and allowed Ball to be elected to the remaining two years left on the first seat and Addicks' lieutenant, J. Frank Allee was elected to the second seat.|$|E

Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by Māori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find Pākehā tramping through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground. Surveyors became involved in skirmishes with the Māori, most of whom refused to budge, and were provided with weapons to continue their work.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} the two World Wars saw an {{increase}} in the volume of traffic, as the motor car and Southampton Corporation Tramways evolved. It became essential to develop new routes around the Bargate as the central arch was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obstruction. By 1931, a tram passed through the Bargate every 30 seconds and over the course of 14 hours, 2000 cars and 6000 bicycles would use the same narrow passage between Above Bar and the High Street. The photographs (below) illustrate the problem. Several old buildings and part of the medieval walls were demolished {{on both sides of the}} Bargate. In 1932, the Bargate was bypassed on its eastern side. The Bargate became an island when it was bypassed on its western side in 1938.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outlier with other poll results.|$|E

25|$|January 17: Only {{days after}} agreeing to avoid {{arbitration}} with Prado, the Braves {{agreed to a}} one-year contract worth $2.49 million with reliever Eric O'Flaherty. Making $895,000 in 2011, the left-handed pitcher posted a 0.98 ERA in 78 appearances, leading all Major League relievers. O'Flaherty also became the first pitcher in Major League history to post a sub-1.00 ERA with at least 70 appearances. Hours later, the Braves avoided arbitration on starting pitcher Jair Jurrjens and center fielder Michael Bourn, the final two arbitration-eligible players on the Braves roster, by tendering them both one-year contracts. Both clients of Scott Boras, Jurrjens will receive $5.5 million and Bourn will receive $6.845 million in 2012. Later the same day, the Braves announced the signing of free agent relief pitcher Peter Moylan to a one-year Minor League contract worth $1 million. Moylan, who suffered injuries {{through most of the}} 2011 season, was not tendered a contract by the Braves which would have allowed him to undergo the arbitration process. Expecting around $2 million through arbitration, the Braves felt Moylan's surgically repaired right shoulder posed <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injury risk. With his contract including an invitation to the Major League Spring training camp, Moylan will have an opportunity to prove his health.|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't {{want to put it}} out because it was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{considered}} the Jim and Dwight scenes {{to be one}} of the only highlights of the episode, especially due to them being the core element to the series. She criticized Robert's role in the episode and series, calling his character [...] "a tool ... I mean that in both senses", and also wrote that he was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inconsistent character. She concluded that while the episode was not [...] "terrible", it was a mediocre conclusion to the Florida storyline and wrote that [...] "I've got a suspicion that the best part of Season 8 is behind us". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, writing that the only drawback for the episode was the Scranton subplot, because it [...] "turned really old, really fast", although he did compliment Lieberstein's performance in the episode.|$|E

500|$|The most criticized {{aspect of}} the Climax Series is the one-game {{advantage}} that is awarded to the regular-season champions for the Final Stage. When the rule was implemented the for the 2008 Climax Series, many players reacted negatively with some describing the rule as [...] "unfair", [...] "bad", [...] "bull" [...] and [...] "messed up". Former player and current manager Alex Ramírez, however, believed that the league champion deserves the advantage. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey believes that the [...] "phantom win" [...] gives the pennant winner <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> advantage. According to him, the First Stage bye plus all home games during the Final Stage should be advantage enough for the top-seeded team.

500|$|In 2003, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson {{commented that}} the episode was a good start to season three, but it [...] "gets sappy on {{more than a few}} occasions, and it lacks the acerbic bite of the series' best shows. Nonetheless, it tosses out some good laughs, and the guest {{appearance}} by Jackson—under a pseudonym—works well; Michael shows an ability to mock himself that still surprises me." [...] In a 2004 review for Digitally Obsessed, Nate Meyers wrote that [...] "there are many funny gags in this episode, especially in the first act when Homer gets a tour of the [...] hospital. Some clever references are made to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but {{the second half of the}} episode is not especially funny. The jokes seem forced and there is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> effort to sentimentalize the relationship between Bart and Lisa, causing the show to lose its narrative drive."

500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style {{is all over}} the record, as most tracks sound too formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E

[...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, {{the appeal of the}} game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".|$|E
