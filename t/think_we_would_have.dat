I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I hope we can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|Armagh manager Joe Kernan {{claimed he}} would have {{resigned}} had his side won but defeat encouraged him to continue. He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and {{got back to the}} final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added that he was confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I think if Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man down I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things {{and that was one of}} them." [...] McDonnell applauded Conor Gormley's tackle which prevented him from scoring: [...] "...I'd say it was one of the best tackles ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Tarkenton's fourth {{with the}} Giants, New York showed marked improvement, fielding their most {{competitive}} team since 1963. After an 0–3 start the Giants won 9 {{out of their}} next 10, [...] and went into their season finale against the Los Angeles Rams {{with a chance to}} win the NFC East Division. Though New York took an early 3–0 lead, the Rams scored the next 31 points, dashing the Giants hopes and leaving them out of the playoffs. Tarkenton had his best season as a Giant in 1970 and made the Pro Bowl. Much of the team's success was credited to him. Teammate Fred Dryer later commented, [...] "ithout Tarkenton, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won any games." [...] Running back Ron Johnson also made the Pro Bowl and ran for 1,027yards, becoming the first Giant ever to gain 1,000yards rushing in a season, and Webster was named NFL Coach of the Year. Meanwhile, the Jets, much as the Giants had in 1964, fell apart, dropping to a 4–10 record after several consecutive seasons of success, with Namath breaking his wrist in a Super Bowl III rematch with the Baltimore Colts and missing the final eight games.|$|E

2500|$|Seven jury members, {{including}} Gildea, signed separate petitions requesting Ryan's {{death sentence}} be commuted {{to life in}} prison. Later, some of the jurors came forth and stated {{they would never have}} convicted Ryan of murder had they known that he would in fact be executed. Gildea said [...] "We didn't want the rope. If we had known Ryan would hang, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone for manslaughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elbegdorj {{has long}} been an {{advocate}} for women's rights and more proportional representation of women in decision making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. [...] "We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges," [...] Elbegdorj said [...] "Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more women in power, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict." ...|$|E
2500|$|Webber caused {{controversy}} with {{a series}} of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: [...] "I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. I saw no black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good." [...] The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.|$|E
5000|$|Then one day, {{just like}} in the {{beginning}} of the series, Ki-joo throws a coin into a fountain and makes a wish to see Tae-young again. As he turns, he sees her standing there. The next scene shows them sitting by a river. Tae-young breaks the silence and asks, [...] "If we had not met in Paris, do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> ended up together?" [...] Ki-joo answers, [...] "Most likely <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{opening the}} Victorian Returned Services League Conference {{shortly before his}} {{retirement}} as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who {{had served in the}} Vietnam War. [...] "People who throw stones at Americans," [...] he said, [...] "should stop and <b>think</b> where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in 1942 without the Americans." [...] Such remarks earned him a rebuke from the then acting State Opposition Leader, Frank Wilkes, as [...] "untactful" [...] for a representative of the Crown.|$|R

2500|$|Piquet Jr. was criticised {{by many in}} the {{community}} and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want {{to be associated with the}} Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. [...] "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place." [...] Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> any interest [...] at Red Bull Racing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{glanced down}} at her in swift surprise, and then his face became a mask again. [...] "Well," [...] he said slowly, [...] "when I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been beaten without it, {{somebody}} lent us enough dollars to carry us through. It sounds very simple, but it has made a new man of me. To have dragged down all the men who trusted me would have hurt me horribly." ...|$|E
60|$|January 5.--Went by {{invitation}} to wait upon a priest, who almost rivals my fighting bishop of Malta. He {{is the old}} Bishop of Tarentum,[507] and, notwithstanding his age, eighty and upwards, is still a most interesting man. A face formed to express an interest in whatever passes; caressing manners, and a total absence of that rigid stiffness which hardens {{the heart of the}} old and converts them into a sort of petrifaction. Apparently his foible was a fondness for cats; one of them, a superb brindled Persian cat, is a great beauty, and seems a particular favourite. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> got on well together if he could have spoken English, or I French or Latin; but hélas! I once saw at Lord Yarmouth's house a Persian cat, but not quite so fine as that of the Bishop. He gave me a Latin devotional poem and an engraving of himself, and I came home about two o'clock.|$|E
5000|$|Penny Krowitz, {{who is the}} {{executive}} director of Act to End Violence Against Women was also critical of the billboard. Speaking to the National Post, she said “If we had enough men coming forward saying, ‘I need shelter from this abusive woman’ or ‘I need shelter from this situation,’ do you not <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> provided those services to men?” and adding that “if service providers were finding that there was such a need for men’s shelters, there would be men’s shelters,” ...|$|R
5000|$|Stevie Nicks {{especially}} {{remembers the}} experience as unpleasant. Two weeks beforehand, {{she had gone}} into rehabilitation to attempt to end her cocaine addiction. However, the video shoot could not be rescheduled, {{and she had to}} take a break for it. Near {{the end of the first}} of three days, she was exhausted and said she wanted some cocaine. A small bottle that was discreetly brought to her was later thrown out before she could use any. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> gone on to make many more great videos like 'Gypsy' had we not been so into drugs." ...|$|R
50|$|In this context, {{where the}} court would {{necessarily}} be dealing with the future enforceability of the patents, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been appropriate, if {{it appeared that the}} Government's claims for further relief were substantial, for the court to have also entertained the Government's challenge to the validity of those patents.|$|R
6000|$|But when I have {{admitted}} all this, I {{ask if there}} is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery? I do not see that there is any parallel at all between them. Consider it. When have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-lumber laws of Maine, or the fact that Louisiana produces sugar, and Illinois flour? When have we had any quarrels over these things? When have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union? We have sometimes had peace, but when was it? It was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was. We have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not. I ask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest promise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas has intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office-seekers and ambitious Northern politicians. He thinks we want to get [...] "his place," [...] I suppose. I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us. The Bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> discovered that fact without the Bible. I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas.|$|E
6000|$|During {{the home}} journey Consuelo {{recovered}} her spirits, and parted from {{me with a}} magnanimous and forgiving pressure of the hand. I {{do not know what}} explanation of Chu Chu's original escapade was given to Enriquez {{and the rest of the}} family; the inscrutable forgiveness extended to me by Consuelo precluded any further inquiry on my part. I was willing to leave it a secret between her and Chu Chu. But, strange to say, it seemed to complete our own understanding, and precipitated, not only our lovemaking, but the final catastrophe which culminated that romance. For we had resolved to elope. I do not know that this heroic remedy was absolutely necessary from the attitude of either Consuelo's family or my own; I am inclined to think we preferred it, because it involved no previous explanation or advice. Need I say that our confidant and firm ally was Consuelo's brother--the alert, the linguistic, the ever-happy, ever-ready Enriquez! It was understood that his presence would not only give a certain mature respectability to our performance--but I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> contemplated this step without it. During one of our riding excursions we were to secure the services of a Methodist minister in the adjoining county, and, later, that of the Mission padre--when the secret was out. [...] "I will gif her away," [...] said Enriquez confidently, [...] "it will on the instant propitiate the old shadbelly who shall perform the affair, and withhold his jaw. A little chin-music from your oncle 'Arry shall finish it! Remain tranquil and forgot not a ring! One does not always, in the agony and dissatisfaction of the moment, a ring remember. I shall bring two in the pocket of my dress." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{material}} appetites of the passengers, sharpened by the keen mountain air, were more potent than their curiosity, and, as the breakfast-bell rang {{out at the}} moment the stage stopped, a majority of them rushed into the dining-room and scrambled for places without giving much heed to the vanished couple or to the Judge and Yuba Bill, who had disappeared also. The through coach to Marysville and Sacramento was likewise waiting, for Sugar Pine was the limit of Bill's ministration, and the coach which we had just left went no farther. In the course of twenty minutes, however, there was a slight and somewhat ceremonious bustling in the hall and on the veranda, and Yuba Bill and the Judge reappeared. The latter was leading, with some elaboration of manner and detail, the shapely figure of Miss Mullins, and Yuba Bill was accompanying her companion to the buggy. We all rushed to the windows to get {{a good view of the}} mysterious stranger and probable ex-brigand whose life was now linked with our fair fellow-passenger. I am afraid, however, that we all participated in a certain impression of disappointment and doubt. Handsome and even cultivated-looking, he assuredly was--young and vigorous in appearance. But there was a certain half-shamed, half-defiant suggestion in his expression, yet coupled with a watchful lurking uneasiness which was not pleasant and hardly becoming in a bridegroom--and the possessor of such a bride. But the frank, joyous, innocent face of Polly Mullins, resplendent with a simple, happy confidence, melted our hearts again, and condoned the fellow's shortcomings. We waved our hands; I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given three rousing cheers as they drove away if the omnipotent eye of Yuba Bill had not been upon us. It was well, for the next moment we were summoned to the presence of that soft-hearted autocrat.|$|E
60|$|We {{stopped at}} Mrs. Carson's, paid her what we owed her, and engaged {{her to go}} up to the tavern and put things in order. She was very sorry we were going, but hoped <b>we</b> <b>would</b> come back again some other summer. We said that it was quite {{possible}} that we might do so; but that, next time, <b>we</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> try to <b>have</b> a tavern of our own.|$|R

2500|$|A {{documentary}} titled Lockerbie Revisited {{aired on}} 27 April 2009, {{in which the}} film's director and narrator, Gideon Levy, interviewed officials involved with the case. Former FBI Laboratory scientist Fred Whitehurst described the FBI laboratory itself as a [...] "crime scene," [...] where an unqualified colleague Thomas Thurman would routinely alter his scientific reports. The interviews also revealed that the timer fragment had never been tested for explosives residue due to [...] "budgetary reasons." [...] Thurman, who led the forensic investigation and identified the fragment's Libyan connection, confirmed {{that it was the}} [...] "only real piece of evidence against Libya". When asked {{about the importance of the}} timer in the conviction of al-Megrahi, FBI Task Force Chief Richard Marquise stated, [...] "It would be a very difficult case to prove ...

5000|$|Some {{suggested}} {{implications for}} companies other than Facebook specifically. The IPO could jeopardize profits for underwriters who face investors {{skeptical of the}} technology industry. In the long-run, the troubled process [...] "makes it harder for the next social-media company that wants to go public." [...] While the Wall Street Journal called for a broad perspective on the issue, they agreed that valuations and funding for future startup IPOs could take a hit. Online travel company Kayak.com delayed its IPO roadshow {{in the wake of}} Facebook's troubles. Analyst Trip Chowdhry suggested an even broader conclusion with regards to IPOs, arguing [...] "that hype doesn't sell anymore, short of fundamentals." [...] CBS News compared the situation to the dot-com bubble, warning that [...] "You'd <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>would</b> <b>have</b> learned our lesson" [...] from that period of overvaluation.|$|R
60|$|That {{might well}} have been, but, as I expected, he was not. He broke water on a slack line and showed us all his dripping, {{colorful}} body nearer than a hundred feet. R. C. thereupon performed with incredible speed at the reel and quickly had a tight line. Mr. Sailfish did not like that. He slid out, wrathfully wagging his bill, and left a seamy, foamy track behind him, finally to end that play with a splendid long leap. He was headed away from us now, with two hundred yards of line out, going hard and fast, {{and we had to}} follow him. We had a fine straightaway run to recover the line. This was a thrilling chase, and one, I <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had if R. C. had been using heavy tackle. The sailfish led us out half a mile before he sounded.|$|R

The tour was officially announced via the band's official website in April 2010.
