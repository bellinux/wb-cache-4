5|$|Emergency Care Practitioner – This position, {{sometimes}} called 'Super Paramedic' in the media, {{is designed to}} bridge the link between ambulance care and <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general practitioner.

5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warden.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 14thcentury, the de la Warre family {{acquired}} the land through marriage. Thomas de la Warre refounded {{the church as}} a collegiate church in 1421. De la Warre gave the site of his manor house {{for the construction of a}} college, where eight priests, four clerks and six lay choristers lived in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warden. It is likely that building began between 1424 and 1429, and the main hall and cloister rooms finished by 1458. It remains the most complete building of its kind in the country, and at the time of its construction, was the second largest building in Manchester, surpassed only by the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious {{to suggest that the}} children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E
5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, while under <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before {{the end of}} the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E
5|$|Long ago, the {{continent}} of Archanea was invaded by the Dolhr Empire, led by the Shadow Dragon Medeus. Anri, a youth from Altea, defeated the Shadow Dragon using the divine sword Falchion. The Kingdom of Archanea was restored and the world entered an age of peace. However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and Elice sacrifices herself so Marth can escape. Accompanied {{by a handful of}} knights, he takes refuge in the island nation of Talys.|$|E

5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, John was passed from Eleanor into <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wet nurse, a {{traditional}} practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then left for Poitiers, {{the capital of}} Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done {{with the aim of}} steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulf de Glanvill, a leading English administrator. John spent some time {{as a member of the}} household of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the House of Commons was petitioned by Craven Berkeley, who had {{previously}} sat as the member of parliament for Cheltenham. He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, {{had been forced to}} join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a postulant (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit £80,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to François VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not tried to see Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that she was not a postulant, and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot.|$|E
