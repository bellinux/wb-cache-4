5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged <b>those</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

This was an {{enormous}} success and that limited section of the line made a surplus of £500 in the remainder of the year. The section between Irvine and Kilwinning opened on 23 March 1840.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at <b>those</b> <b>points,</b> allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. Using <b>those</b> <b>points,</b> the player is given the option of creating a racer with customized color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: Max Speed, Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer's ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points can be assigned {{to each of the}} five racing parameters. Customized racers can be used in all of the game's modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.|$|E

25|$|Borrowing {{terminology}} {{from special}} relativity, points with Q>0 are considered timelike; in addition, if x0>0, then {{the point is}} called future-pointing.

The null cone S consists of <b>those</b> <b>points</b> where Qnbsp&=nbsp&0; the future null cone N+ are <b>those</b> <b>points</b> on the null cone with x0nbsp&>nbsp&0. The celestial sphere is then identified with the collection of rays in N+ whose initial point is the origin of R4.

40|$|Abstract: in {{most modern}} robotic applications, having {{accurate}} object recognition and classification {{is becoming an}} ubiquitous requirement. To deal with the latter, several techniques have been proposed, using either monocular computer vision, stereo vision, and even laser arrays. Recently, new laser devices introduced into the market, are able to capture the whole environment as a sequence of several {{hundreds of thousands of}} points per second, sampled from the environment, along a cylinder around the laser device. Essentially, with correct pose estimation, <b>those</b> <b>point</b> clouds give us exactly 3 D point coordinates for a very fine-grain sampling of the scene around us. In this paper, we present two techniques for recognizing objects based on <b>those</b> <b>point</b> clouds. The first one i...|$|R

25|$|Using {{linear algebra}} one can {{construct}} finite difference approximations which utilize an arbitrary {{number of points}} {{to the left and}} a (possibly different) number of points {{to the right of the}} evaluation point, for any order derivative.

50|$|The term polar {{is often}} used for <b>those</b> <b>point</b> groups which are neither centrosymmetric nor chiral.

Thus some chiral space groups are also polar.|$|R

SC Reinach struggled in 2016–17, but the twins were vital in a relegation series win against SC Weinfelden, combining for four goals and seven points to save their squad's top-flight status. Of particular importance among <b>those</b> <b>points</b> were Raschelle's goal and assist and Chelsea's goal in a 4–0 fourth-game win to force a decisive fifth contest.|$|E

Thus Alinghi prevailed on <b>those</b> <b>points.</b> The court also ordered a hearing {{in order to determine the}} date on which GGYC could reasonably be compelled to produce the Custom House Certificate for its yacht.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{modification}} of standard WENO finite volume methods for Cartesian grids, which retains the full spatial order of {{accuracy of the}} one-dimensional discretization when applied to nonlinear multidimensional systems of conservation laws. We derive formulas, which allow us to compute high-order accurate point values of the conserved quantities at grid cell interfaces. Using <b>those</b> <b>point</b> values, we can compute a high-order flux {{at the center of}} a grid cell interface. Finally, we use <b>those</b> <b>point</b> values to compute high-order accurate averaged fluxes at cell interfaces as needed by a finite volume method. The method is described in detail for the two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. An extension to the three-dimensional case as well as to other nonlinear systems of conservation laws in divergence form is straightforward. Furthermore, similar ideas can be used to improve the accuracy of WENO type methods for hyperbolic systems which are not in divergence form. Several test computations confirm the high-order accuracy for smooth nonlinear problems...|$|R

25|$|By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan {{line was}} {{suffering}} from congestion caused by the limited capacity of its tracks between Baker Street and Finchley Road stations. To relieve this pressure, the network-wide New Works Programme, 1935-1940 included {{the construction of new}} sections of tunnel between the Bakerloo line's platforms at Baker Street and Finchley Road and the replacement of three Metropolitan line stations (Lord's, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage) between <b>those</b> <b>points</b> with two new Bakerloo stations (St. John's Wood and Swiss Cottage). The Bakerloo line took over the Metropolitan line's service to Stanmore on 20 November 1939. The branch remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1 May 1979, when similar congestion problems for the Bakerloo line caused by two branches converging at Baker Street led to the opening of the Jubilee line, initially created by connecting the Stanmore branch to new tunnels bored between Baker Street and Charing Cross.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{after four}} runner-up {{spots in the}} {{preceding}} six seasons, it was the Combined Islands' turn to win the Shell Shield trophy in 1980-81. After starting with a draw in Trinidad, the Combined Islands won both home games - first an innings win over Jamaica, in which Andy Roberts took 11 for 101 and completed a hat-trick, and then a 165-run win over Guyana which sealed the trophy with one game to play - against Barbados, who were 35 points behind. Despite going down by an innings and 16 runs, the Combined Islands finished 12 points ahead of Barbados - who had been docked nine of <b>those</b> <b>points</b> due to a slow over rate. The Test stars Richards and Roberts topped the batting and bowling tables respectively - Richards making 323 runs despite being dismissed for 13 and 4 by Barbados, while Roberts took 24 wickets in the three games not against Barbados - and one for 48 against the Bajans.|$|E
25|$|In , Williams {{employed}} the Supertec engine, {{which was a}} rebadged Mecachrome-Renault unit, and a new driver line-up. Villeneuve moved to the new British American Racing (BAR) team and Frentzen moved to the Jordan team. German Ralf Schumacher joined Williams in {{what amounted to a}} driver trade as Frentzen would be taking over Schumacher's old ride at Jordan. Alex Zanardi, an Italian driver who had won the last two CART series championships, also joined the team after Williams had {{spent the better part of}} the last year trying to sign him. The team managed three podiums, all scored by Ralf Schumacher, with third place in Australia and Britain and a second place in Italy. The team finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, the lowest finish for Williams in the 1990s; the team finished behind Stewart and Jordan, scoring a total of 35 points. Of <b>those</b> <b>points,</b> all were scored by Schumacher as Zanardi, who had not performed well in his previous stint in F1, failed to finish in the top six in any race. At the end of the season, Williams bought out Zanardi's contract.|$|E
