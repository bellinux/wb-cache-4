We address {{the dependence of}} the upper Lyapunov exponent of (T,A) on the dynamics T when the map A is kept fixed. We introduce explicit conditions on the cocycle that allow to perturb the dynamics, in the weak and uniform topologies, to make the exponent drop arbitrarily close to zero. In the weak topology we deduce that if X is a compact connected manifold, then for a C^r (r > 1) open and dense set of maps A, either (T,A) is uniformly hyperbolic for every T, or the Lyapunov exponents of (T,A) vanish for the generic measurable <b>T.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> case, we obtain that if X is of dimension greater than 2, then for a C^r (r > 1) generic map A, there is a residual set of volume-preserving homeomorphisms T for which either (T,A) is uniformly hyperbolic or the Lyapunov exponents of (T,A) vanish.

Mullen, Markov-recapture {{population}} estimates: a {{tool for}} improving interpretation of trapping experiments, Ecology 75 (1994) 1109] propose a four-state discrete time Markov process, which describes {{the structure of a}} marking-capture experiment as a method of population estimation. They propose this method primarily for estimation of closed insect populations. Their method provides a mark-recapture estimate from a single trap observation by allowing subjects to mark themselves. The estimate of the unknown population size {{is based on the assumption}} of a closed population and a simple Markov model in which the rates of marking, capture, and recapture are assumed to be equal. Using the one step transition probability matrix of their model, we illustrate how to go from an embedded discrete time Markov process to a continuous time Markov process assuming exponentially distributed holding times. We also compute the transition probabilities after time <b>t</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> time case and compare the limiting behavior of the continuous and discrete time processes. Finally, we generalize their model by relaxing the assumption of equal per capita rates for marking, capture, and recapture. Other questions about how their results change when using a continuous time Markov process are examined. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a continuous time stochastic neurite branching model {{closely related to}} the discrete time stochastic BES-model. The discrete time BES-model is underlying current attempts to simulate cortical development, but is difficult to analyze. The new continuous time formulation facilitates analytical treatment thus allowing us to examine the structure of the model more closely. We derive explicit expressions for the time dependent probabilities p(gamma, t) for finding a tree gamma at time t, valid for arbitrary continuous time branching models with tree and segment dependent branching rates. We show, for the specific case of the continuous time BES-model, that as expected from our model formulation, the sums needed to evaluate expectation values of functions of the terminal segment number mu(f(n),t) do not depend on the distribution of the total branching probability over the terminal segments. In addition, we derive a system of differential equations for the probabilities p(n,t) of finding it terminal segments at time <b>t.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> BES-model, this system of differential equations gives direct numerical access to functions only depending on the number of terminal segments, and we use this to evaluate the development of the mean and standard deviation of the number of terminal segments at a time t. For comparison we discuss two cases where mean and variance of the number of terminal segments are exactly solvable. Then we discuss the numerical evaluation of the S-dependence of the solutions for the continuous time BES-model. The numerical results show clearly that higher S values, i. e. values such that more proximal terminal segments have higher branching rates than more distal terminal segments, lead to more symmetrical trees as measured by three tree symmetry indicators.

40|$|Background: Retention in care (RC) is a {{key feature}} of the cascade of {{continuum}} of care that moves from HIV testing to linkage to care, engagement in care and RC. RC {{play an important role}} in achieving and maintaining therapeutic success and is crucial for reduction of HIV transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of RC in the Infectious Disease unit of San Martino Hospital, in Genoa and to identify predictors associated with failed RC. Methods: All new HIV tested and diagnosed subjects were consecutively enrolled from 01 / 01 / 2008 to 01 / 08 / 2014. Follow-up period was censored at 01 February 2015. Demographics, immune-virological status, co-infection with HCV and HBV and therapeutic data were collected at baseline and at the time of last observation.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter {{prospective}} cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To identify {{patient and}} treatment characteristics associated with treatment {{success or failure}} {{in the management of}} odontoid fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Odontoid fractures are the most common cervical spine fractures in the elderly and represent a significant management challenge with widely divergent views regarding operative versus nonoperative management. METHODS: A total of 159 patients 65 years and older with radiographically confirmed type II odontoid fractures were enrolled at 10 sites in the United States and 1 site in Canada between January 2006 and May 2009. Subjects were followed at 6 and 12 months post-initial treatment with Neck Disability Index and SF- 36 v 2 scores. Final treatment outcome was classified as failure or success. Treatment failure was defined as death by any cause, decline in Neck Disability Index by more than 9. 5 absolute points, or occurrence of a major treatment-related complication. Baseline characteristics between the groups were compared using <b>t</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> variables and χ 2 test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> categorical variables. Baseline characteristics associated with treatment outcomes were identified by multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 101 (63. 5 %) patients were treated surgically and 58 (36. 5 %) conservatively. Forty-four (27. 7 %) patients had a successful outcome and 86 (54. 1 %) had a treatment failure; for 29 patients (18. 2 %), treatment status could not be determined (3 withdrew; 26 were lost to follow-up). Twenty-nine (18. 2 %) patients expired before the 12 -month follow-up. Follow-up information was available for 103 of 127 surviving (81. 1 %) patients. Twelve-month SF- 36 v 2 scores were worse in the failure group. The characteristics associated with treatment failure were older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 08 for each year of age); initial nonsurgical treatment (OR = 3. 09); male sex (OR = 4. 33), and baseline neurological system comorbidity (OR = 4. 13).

40|$|O crescimento do setor avÃcola, tanto para atendimento ao mercado interno como para exportaÃÃo, tem movimentado o agronegÃcio brasileiro. A cadeia produtiva do frango de corte gera uma variedade e quantidade considerÃvel de resÃduos com as mais distintas caracterÃsticas. No caso dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio, tem-se um volume considerÃvel de {{material}} produzido, com grande potencial poluidor. Considerando a problemÃtica este projeto teve por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade de aproveitamento dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio por meio da co-digestÃo anaerÃbia. Para o ensaio de co-digestÃo foi utilizada uma bateria de 20 biodigestores, confeccionados com tubos de PVC, com capacidade para aproximadamente 60 L cada, simulando um biodigestor tubular horizontal. Os resÃduos foram cedidos pela Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata â Copacol e sÃo provenientes das unidades de CafelÃndia â PR (Abate de aves), Nova Aurora â PR (IncubatÃrio de Aves) e Formosa â PR (Unidade Produtora de LeitÃes â UPL). Cinco misturas foram avaliadas, sendo elas: Tratamento 1 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua do tanque de equalizaÃÃo da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 2 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 3 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio. Tratamento 4 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Tratamento 5 (Misto) : ResÃduos de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Cada mistura compÃs um tratamento, o qual foi repetido quatro vezes. Todas as misturas foram processadas em liquidificador. As diferentes misturas foram calculadas de maneira a obter um substrato com 4 % de sÃlidos totais no inÃcio do processo - fase batelada, e com 2 % de sÃlidos totais para fase contÃnua. AlÃm dos materiais avaliados, todos os tratamentos receberam uma porcentagem de 15 % de inÃculo (resÃduo de gado de corte) na fase batelada e fase de adaptaÃÃo do sistema na alimentaÃÃo contÃnua. Primeiramente foi realizado o ensaio em batelada, o que possibilitou definir o ponto de queima do biogÃs nos diferentes tratamentos, bem como a curva de produÃÃo de gÃs, definindo assim, o tempo de retenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TRH) do substrato nos biodigestores. Para a fase contÃnua os biodigestores foram descarregados no final da fase batelada onde o efluente foi peneirado. ApÃs a fraÃÃo lÃquida foi novamente disposta nos biodigestores. A partir desta fase iniciouse o abastecimento continuo onde durante um mÃs os biodigestores alÃm de sua carga diÃria tambÃm receberam uma porcentagem de inÃculo para que houvesse uma adaptaÃÃo do sistema. As anÃlises de caracterizaÃÃo foram realizadas no afluente e efluente dos biodigestores na fase batelada, nos resÃduos separadamente, no afluente e efluente da fase contÃnua como tambÃm no resÃduo retido no biodigestor apÃs fase de abastecimento contÃnuo. Foram utilizadas metodologias especÃficas para as anÃlises, tais como: ST, SV, carbono orgÃnico total, nitrogÃnio (NTK), minerais, pH, condutividade elÃtrica, DQO, bem como o potencial mÃdio de produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano, porcentagem de metano e diÃxido de carbono no mesmo. T 4 apresentou os melhores desempenhos em produÃÃo de biogÃs. Maiores porcentagens de CH 4 na fase batelada foram apresentadas pelo tratamento T 2. Para fase contÃnua as maiores porcentagens foram apresentadas pelos tratamentos T 2, T 4 e T 5. A maior reduÃÃo nos valores de DQO foi observada no tratamento contendo Ãgua residuÃria da lagoa anaerÃbia do frigorifico - T 2. A concentraÃÃo de minerais no efluente dos biodigestores, para todos os tratamentos, agregou ao biofertilizante valor agronÃmico. The {{growth of}} the poultry sector, both to supply the internal market and for export, has moved the Brazilian agribusiness. The productive chain of the broiler generates a considerable variety and quantity of waste with the most distinct characteristics. In the case of hatchery waste, has been a considerable volume of material produced, with high pollution potential. Considering the problems this project aimed to study the feasibility of use of hatchery waste by anaerobic co-digestion. To test the co-digestion was used a battery of 20 digesters made with PVC pipes, with a capacity of about 60 L each, simulating a horizontal tubular digester. The wastes were disposed of by Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata - Copacol and are from the units of CafelÃndia - PR (Slaughter of poultry), Nova Aurora - PR (Poultry Hatchery) and Formosa - PR (Unit Production of Piglets - UPL). Five mixtures were evaluated, as follows: Treatment 1 : Residue hatchery drained + Waste water tank agribusiness. Treatment 2 : Residue hatchery drained + water from the first anaerobic pond agribusiness. Treatment 3 : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery. Treatment 4 : Residue hatchery fresh + swine wastewater. Treatment 5 (Mixed) : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery + swine wastewater. Each composed a mixture treatment, which was repeated four times. All blends were processed in the blender. The different mixtures were calculated to obtain a substrate with 4 % total solids early in the process - batch phase, and 2 % total solids for solid phase. Besides the materials evaluated, all treatments received a percentage of 15 % of inoculum (cattle waste) during batch and adaptation phase of <b>the</b> system in <b>continuous</b> feeding. First test was performed in batch, {{making it possible to}} define the point of burning the biogas in the different treatments, and the curve of gas production, thus setting the hydraulic retention time (TRH) substrate in <b>the</b> digesters. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> phase digesters were unloaded {{at the end of the}} batch phase where the effluent was screened. After, the liquid fraction was again prepared in the digesters. From this phase, began one where supplies still over a month the digesters beyond their daily load also received a percentage of inoculum for there was an adaptation of the system. Analyses were performed to characterize the influent and effluent of the digesters in the batch phase, the waste separately, in the influent and effluent of <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> phase as well in residue retained in the digester after stage continuous water supply. Specific methodologies were used for analysis, such as: ST, SV, total organic carbon, nitrogen (TKN), minerals, pH, conductivity, COD, and the average potential of biogas production and methane content of methane and carbon dioxide carbon in it. T 4 showed the best performance in biogas production. Higher percentages of CH 4 in the batch phase were presented by <b>the</b> <b>T</b> 2. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>continuous</b> phase, <b>the</b> highest percentages were presented by the T 2, T 4 and T 5.
