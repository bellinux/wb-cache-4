He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: [...] "I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats.

This is the kind of innovation that appeals to me." [...] Other notable filmmakers who have praised it include Bernardo Bertolucci, Wim Wenders, Peter Bogdanovich, Noah Baumbach and Cameron Crowe. Henri Cartier-Bresson, who worked on the film before beginning a long career as a photojournalist, called it [...] "one of the summits of art and a premonition of everything that was to happen in the world."

2500|$|According to Lord Harewood, [...] "Very few Italian {{conductors}} {{have had}} a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin, and perhaps none, apart from Toscanini, more influence". In 1968, Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the [...] "really lucky" [...] opportunity of her career, because [...] "he taught me {{that there must be}} an expression; that there must be a justification. He <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> depth of music, the justification of music. That's where I really really drank all I could from this man".|$|E

2500|$|On Neuhaus: [...] "I {{learned a}} lot from him, even though he kept saying that {{there was nothing he could}} teach me. Music is written to be played and listened to and has always seemed to me to be able to manage without words... This was exactly the case with Heinrich Neuhaus. In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted. And so he left me to do as I liked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not yet {{formally}} {{nominated for}} the Vice Presidency, John Edwards took the stage at the Convention to give the first major national speech of his political career. Delegates raised red-and-white vertical [...] "Edwards" [...] banners and chanted his name. The theme of Edwards's address was the divide between the [...] "two Americas," [...] his populist message throughout the primary campaign and now one embraced by Kerry. He tied the division to his own roots in North Carolina, and introduced his family to the audience. Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: [...] "You <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for everyone. You taught me that there's dignity and honor in a hard day's work. You taught me to always look out for our neighbors, to never look down on anybody, and treat everybody with respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gackt's musical {{education}} {{began at}} age three {{when his parents}} initiated his classical piano education. He grew tired of the piano at age seven when he entered elementary school, and because of moving had to change teachers. It would take another four years until his parents allowed him to quit lessons. Since his father played the trumpet, Gackt was also familiar with brass instruments. He has credited the classical pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin with being [...] "the one who <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> beauty, depth, fun, sadness, the kindness of music; that music could grant people courage, {{and the meaning of}} the layers of sound. It isn't an exaggeration to say Chopin is the foundation of my music". Having only listened to classical music and enka while growing up, he did not become interested in rock music until he was a young adult. He cited Led Zeppelin's [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] as being particularly inspiring, and went on to master modern percussion and electric guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Rock Newman {{was a black}} {{businessman}} who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist. The week following his firing, Tracht {{held a press conference}} and made an apology to his listeners, [...] "Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> value of respect and restraint." [...] They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on BET Tonight with Tavis Smiley on Black Entertainment Television where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, [...] "Let me down off this cross, will you?" [...] Counseling was recommended.

2500|$|On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago {{during a}} tight pennant race, Newman {{took a turn}} in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits. Shortly after completion, Newman {{collapsed}} {{on the field and}} was immediately rushed to the hospital. After several tests, it was determined he had suffered a brain hemorrhage. His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down like that, because this is the guy who pretty much <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E
