5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when <b>to</b> <b>kiss</b> other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the wrong time <b>to</b> <b>kiss</b> will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E
