5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.|$|E

5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part}} of the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E

5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity.

5|$|First-person {{shooters}} are {{a type of}} three-dimensional shooter game, {{featuring a}} first-person point of view with which the player sees the action through <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player character.

5|$|Following {{the capture}} of the city Japanese {{soldiers}} massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the Nanking Massacre.

50|$|Some storyline {{details were}} changed from {{what had been}} issued as <b>the</b> story for <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, such as the game canvas being set in the Blood March, now located {{south-east}} of Midnight, instead <b>of</b> south-west as <b>the</b> original. Further, the original story had Luxor set Morkin out on <b>the</b> quest for <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, whereas <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Citadel had Luxor already captured. Game designer Singleton explained the continuity error by stating <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Citadel take place some 20 years prior to <b>the</b> events in <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|R

5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E

This action redeemed the division in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper hierarchy of the British military. In 1918, during the German Spring Offensive and the subsequent Allied Hundred Days Offensive, the division attacked several fortified German positions. It crossed the Ancre River, broke through the Hindenburg Line and German positions on the River Selle, ended the war on the Belgian frontier, and was considered one of the Army's elite units. The division was not chosen {{to be part of the}} Occupation of the Rhineland after the war, and was demobilised over several months. It ceased to exist by March 1919.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Evans {{returned}} to Arizona and resumed his studies. In 1985, he represented Australia at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan. The following year, {{he attempted to}} qualify for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh after only ten days training. He made the qualifying time, but was omitted. Evans later stated that he felt his admission of having only trained for ten days had lowered his standing in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selectors.

5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
