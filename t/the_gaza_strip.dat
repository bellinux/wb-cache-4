5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> the West Bank and East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> {{and removed the}} {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E

A total of 154,251 {{students}} were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> revealed {{that there was a}} nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology, science labs and extra curricular activities.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|Khalil al-Wazir {{was born}} in 1935 to Muslim parents {{in the city of}} Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were {{expelled}} in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
