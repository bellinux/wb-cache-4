40|$|Guidewires {{have been}} used in many {{operating}} rooms by vascular surgeons to assist them in positioning and maneuvering through a tortuous stenosis or lesion to a desired location, and {{to be used as a}} guide for the implantation of a catheter. Surgeons are tasked with having to insert a guidewire inside a small cavity, which requires a high level of skill and patience. The insertion of the guide wire is controlled by a <b>torque</b> <b>device,</b> which allows a surgeon to advance, rotate and grip the wet hydrophilic coating of the guidewire. Despite its many advantages, the <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> does, in fact, give rise to many time consuming issues that results in delays to the surgical procedure. One main problem in the use of the <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> is that it is introduced through the proximal end of the guidewire. Therefore, it requires the assistance of another individual, the surgical technician, to advance the <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> from the furthest point away from the patient. Once the <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> is in position, it is up to the surgeon to attempt to control the tightening, advancing and loosening of the device all with one hand. The other, free hand is used as a placement hand to secure the positioning of the guidewire within the patient. Another issue arises in the removal of the <b>torque</b> <b>device,</b> which must be loosened with one hand and slid off the same end it was introduced, often resulting in the unwanted ejection of the guide wire tip from within the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body. The process must then commence from the start, resulting in loss of valuable time, and be repeated until the distal tip of the guidewire is secure in the desired location and the catheter can now be introduced. The main purpose of this research is to investigate, design, and develop a new guidewire <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> to facilitate in a more controlled manipulation of a guidewire by vascular surgeons. Through in-depth interviews with both surgeons and surgical residents alike, direct observational time in the vascular surgery OR (operating room), and I obtained knowledge used as a design basis for the development of the product. For example, observations of relevant medical procedures were also accomplished at Tampa General Hospital to establish a basis for the design,and to assess current vascular surgery medical procedures. Initial design concepts where created using SolidWorks CAD software. After a period of researching and understanding user needs, an assortment of non-slip adhesives where found to be a viable solution to the problem. A characterization analysis was done on the highest rated non-slip adhesive to further define design parameters, and pave the way for FDA approval and product commercialization...|$|E

We investigate if the magnetization of the particle can be manipulated electronically, in the regime where the critical current for magnetization switching is negligibly weak, which could be due to the reduced particle dimensions. Using master equation simulations to evaluate the effects of spin-orbit anisotropy energy fluctuations on spin-transfer, we obtain reliable reading and writing of the magnetization state of such magnetic particle, and find that the device relies on a critical voltage rather than a critical current. The critical voltage is governed by the spin-orbit energy shifts of discrete levels in the particle. This finding opens a possibility to significantly reduce the power dissipation involved in spin-transfer torque switching, by using very small magnetic particles or molecules...|$|E

The qualitative picture obtained this way predicts complex hysteresis patterns that should occur in bilayers. By analyzing the phase portraits of the system we show that when the spin torque induced equilibrium exists, switching between "up" and "down" states proceeds through it as an intermediate state.

Recently, high variability has been reported about the accuracy of spring-style mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>devices</b> (S-S MTDs).

Currently, there is limited information on the steam sterilization influence on the accuracy of MTDs. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (&plusmn; 10 % of the target torque) of spring-style mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>devices</b> for dental implants. Materials and methods: Fifteen new S-S MTDs and their appropriate drivers from three different manufacturers (Nobel Biocare, Straumann [ITI], and Biomet 3 i [3 i]) were selected. Peak <b>torque</b> of <b>devices</b> (5 in each subgroup) was measured before and after autoclaving using a Tohnichi torque gauge. Descriptive statistical analysis was used and a repeated-measures ANOVA with type of device as a between-subject comparison was performed to assess the difference in accuracy among the three groups of spring-style mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>devices</b> after sterilization. A Bonferroni post hoc test was used to assess pairwise comparisons. Results: Before steam sterilization, all the tested devices stayed within 10 % of their target values. After 100 sterilization cycles, results didn&# 39;t show any significant difference between raw and absolute error values in the Nobel Biocare and ITI devices; however the results demonstrated an increase of error values in the 3 i group (P &lt; 0. 05). Raw error values increased with a predictable pattern in 3 i devices and showed more than a 10 % difference from target torque values (maximum difference of 14 % from target torque was seen in 17 % of peak torque measurements). Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, steam sterilization did not affect the accuracy (&plusmn; 10 % of the target torque) of the Nobel Biocare and ITI MTDs. Raw error values increased with a predictable pattern in 3 i devices and showed more than 10 % difference from target torque values.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 63 years) with edentulous maxillae received 168 implants (six each) and an implant-supported fixed interim prosthesis within 24 hours after surgery. After a mean healing time of 15 weeks, the patients received permanent screw-retained prostheses.

Muscle stretching of the right triceps surae muscle was performed using a motor <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> for 1 minute. Three different dorsiflexion torques (at approximately 5, 10, and 15 Nm) were applied during muscle stretching.

The amplitudes of the spinal reflexes in both the stretched and non-stretched muscles in the right (ipsilateral) leg were smaller during stretching compared to before, and at 0 and 5 min after stretching. Furthermore, the degree of reduction in the amplitude of the spinal reflexes in the right (ipsilateral) leg muscles increased significantly as the dorsiflexion torque (i. e., stretching of the right triceps surae muscles) increased. In contrast, reduction in the amplitude of the spinal reflexes with increasing dorsiflexion torque was not seen in the left (contralateral) leg muscles.

"December 2012 "Increasing petroleum prices have developed a strong demand for an invention to reduce fuel consumption, as well as cut the produced amount of carbon dioxide via consumed fuel. Hybrid vehicles are an effective invention in terms of the hybrid research area because they can accomplish a low fuel consumption rate, thus dropping the carbon dioxide volume that is produced correspondingly. The main goal of this research is to design and model a hydraulic hybrid transmission that has a controlled pressure displacement pump and a controlled displacement motor. The design will show reasonable safety factor numbers in the worst conditions of operation. In addition, modeling was done for the entire drive train including 16 equations that signify the mechanical path and the hydraulic path, which represent the Hydraulic Hybrid Transmission (HHT).

40|$|Spin {{transfer}} torque is a torque exerted on {{a magnet}} by transferring spin angular momentum from a current to the magnet. It enables efficient manipulation of nanomagnets using current and can enable important applications. This dissertation focuses on doing measurements of magnetic dynamics using spintorque-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), {{a technique that}} gives quantitative information about device parameters. This technique not only leads to deeper understanding of spin torque devices but can also provide an improved way to characterize devices for applications. In a spin <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> such as a magnetic tunnel junction, a microwave current can drive small magnetic oscillations, which yields an oscillating resistance. If a DC current is applied at the same time, an oscillating voltage will be generated by Ohm's Law. The first project in this dissertation makes use of this RF frequency oscillating voltage to perform a quantitative measurement of spin torque and magnetic damping of the device. The second project discusses the possibility of making this voltage larger than the input voltage and thus producing a microwave amplifier. The same type of magnetic dynamics can be excited using nonlocal spin torque from a pure spin current. In this dissertation, I also discuss how to quantitatively measure the nonlocal spin torque in a 3 -terminal device by adapting the DC-detected ST-FMR technique. Apart from being detected by electrical measurement, the same magnetic dynamics can be directly imaged using X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism. I will use a chapter in this dissertation to discuss our progress in doing so and studying magnetic normal modes, the fundamentals of magnetic dynamics. Last but not the least, in addition to measure conventional metal devices, I will talk about our effort in fabricating and measuring spin torque switching in ferromagnetic semiconductor devices. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|E

40|$|Several {{completely}} new approaches (such as spintronic, carbon nanotube, graphene, TFETs, etc.) to information processing and data storage technologies are emerging {{to address the}} time frame beyond current Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) roadmap. The high speed magnetization switching of a nano-magnet due to current induced spin-transfer torque (STT) have been demonstrated in recent experiments. Such STT devices can be explored in compact, low power memory and logic design. In order to truly leverage STT devices based computing, researchers require a re-think of circuit, architecture, and computing model, since the STT devices {{are unlikely to be}} drop-in replacements for CMOS. The potential of STT devices based computing will be best realized by considering new computing models that are inherently suited to the characteristics of STT devices, and new applications that are enabled by their unique capabilities, thereby attaining performance that CMOS cannot achieve. The goal of this research is to conduct synergistic exploration in architecture, circuit and device levels for Boolean and brain-inspired computing using nanoscale STT devices. Specifically, we first show that the non-volatile STT devices can be used in designing configurable Boolean logic blocks. We propose a spin-memristor threshold logic (SMTL) gate design, where memristive cross-bar array is used to perform current mode summation of binary inputs and the low power current mode spintronic threshold device carries out the energy efficient threshold operation. Next, for brain-inspired computing, we have exploited different spin-transfer <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> structures that can implement the hard-limiting and soft-limiting artificial neuron transfer functions respectively. We apply such STT based neuron (or ‘spin-neuron’) in various neural network architectures, such as hierarchical temporal memory and feed-forward neural network, for performing “human-like” cognitive computing, which show more than two orders of lower energy consumption compared to state of the art CMOS implementation. Finally, we show the dynamics of injection locked Spin Hall Effect Spin-Torque Oscillator (SHE-STO) cluster can be exploited as a robust multi-dimensional distance metric for associative computing, image/ video analysis, etc. Our simulation results show that the proposed system architecture with injection locked SHE-STOs and the associated CMOS interface circuits can be suitable for robust and energy efficient associative computing and pattern matching. ...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} that a spin-polarized current can exert a large torque on a ferromagnet, through direct transfer of spin angular momentum, offers {{the possibility of}} electrical current controlled manipulation of magnetic moment in nanoscale magnetic device structures. This so-called spin torque effect holds great promise for two applications, namely, spin torque oscillators (STOs) for wireless communication and radar communication, and spin transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) for data/information storage.   The STO is a nanosized spintronic device capable of microwave generation at frequencies in the 1 - 65 GHz range with high quality factors. Although the STO is very promising for future telecommunication, two major shortcomings {{have to be addressed}} before it can truly find practical use as a radio-frequency device. Firstly, its very limited output power has to be significantly improved. One possibility is the synchronization of two or more STOs to both increase the microwave power and further increase the signal quality. Synchronization of serially connected STOs has been suggested in this thesis. In this configuration, synchronization relies on phase locking between the STOs and their self-generated alternating current. While this locking mechanism is intrinsically quite weak, we find that the locking range of two serially connected spin-valve STOs can be enhanced by over two orders of magnitude by adjusting the circuit I-V phase to that of an intrinsic preferred phase shift between the STO and an alternating current. More recently, we have also studied the phase-locking of STOs based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ-STO) to meet the power specifications of actual application where the rf output levels should be above 0 dBm (1 mW). In addition to the spin torque terms present in GMR spin valves, MTJs also exhibit a significant perpendicular spin torque component with a quite complex dependence on both material choices and applied junction bias. We find that the perpendicular torque component modifies the intrinsic preferred I-V phase shift in single MTJ-STOs {{in such a way that}} serially connected STOs synchronize much more readily without the need for additional circuitry to change the I-V phase.   Secondly, equal attention has been focused on removing the applied magnetic field for STO operation, which requires bulky components and will limit the miniaturization of STO-based devices. Various attempts have been made to realize STOs operating in zero magnetic field. By using a tilted (oblique angle) polarizer (fixed layer) instead of an in-plane polarizer (standard STO), we show zero field operation over a very wide polarizer angle range without sacrificing output signal. In addition, the polarizer angle introduces an entirely new degree of freedom to any spin <b>torque</b> <b>device</b> and opens up for a wide range of additional phenomena.   The STT-RAM has advantages over other types of memories including conventional MRAM in terms of power consumption, speed, and scalability. We use a set of simulation tools to carry out a systematic study on the subject of micromagnetic switching processes of a device for STT-RAM application. We find that the non-zero k spin wave modes play an important role in the experimentally measured switching phase boundary. These may result in telegraph transitions among different spin-wave states, and be related to the back-hopping phenomena where the switching probability will decrease with increasing bias in tunnel junctions.

Recently, MTJ-based computing architectures such as logic-in-memory have been proposed and claim superior energy-delay performance over static CMOS. In this paper, we conduct exhaustive energy-performance analysis of an STT-MTJ-based logic-in-memory (LIM-MTJ) 1 -bit full adder and compare it with its corresponding CMOS counterpart. Our results show that the LIM-MTJ circuit has no advantage in energy-performance over its equivalent CMOS designs. We also show that the MTJ-based logic circuit requiring frequent MTJ switching during the operation is hardly power efficient.

40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, {{the family of}} Heusler {{compounds}} has attracted tremendous scientific and technological interest {{in the field of}} spintronics. This is essentially due to their exceptional magnetic properties, which qualify them as promising functional materials in various data-storage devices, such as giant-magnetoresistance spin valves, magnetic tunnel junctions, and spin-transfer <b>torque</b> <b>devices.</b> In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on the applications of the Heusler family in magnetic data storage. In addition to their important roles in the performance improvement of these devices, we also try to point out the challenges as well as possible solutions, of the current Heusler-based devices. We hope that this review would spark further investigation efforts into efficient incorporation of this eminent family of materials into data storage applications by fully arousing their intrinsic potential.
