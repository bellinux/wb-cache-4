5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of God, <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of religion, and <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|Upon seeing <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> approaching, Moore opened full sail and {{cut away}} his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> pulled closer, Moore opened fire. <b>The</b> <b>Unity</b> crew managed to avoid damage and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto <b>the</b> <b>Unity.</b> Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E

50|$|The Albion Order of Oddfellows {{was formed}} from <b>the</b> Manchester <b>Unity</b> in 1831. Several other secessions then {{occurred}} {{to form the}} Nottingham Independent Order, the Derby Midland Order, <b>the</b> Ilkison <b>Unity</b> and <b>the</b> Norfolk and Norwich <b>Unity.</b> <b>The</b> Kent <b>Unity</b> was formed in 1805; its first Lodge, however, was not formed until 1861.|$|R
5|$|After {{escaping}} the Machias men, the Margaretta {{was forced to}} jibe into brisk winds, {{which resulted in the}} main boom and gaff breaking away, crippling its navigability. Once Moore was in Holmes Bay he captured a sloop and took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta's. Moore also took its pilot, Robert Avery, captive. <b>The</b> <b>Unity</b> crew of about 30 Machias men elected Jeremiah O'Brien as their captain and sailed out to chase down the Margaretta. Since <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> was a much faster sailing vessel, O'Brien's crew quickly caught up to the crippled Margaretta, while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind.|$|E

5|$|An {{unofficial}} fan-made {{remake of}} the game for Microsoft Windows began development in 2015, being made in <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> engine by an ensemble of fans known as Gistix. A demo version, featuring a brief gameplay segment for Sonic, was released in January 2017. Unlike the original game, the demo was positively received by gaming journalists.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} early 2014, and {{prompted}} skepticism from both Square Enix staff and its prospective platform managers, {{who were more}} used to the dominant 2D-based mobile games. One of the problems cited by project leader Naoki Hamaguchi was creating realistic facial expressions equivalent to those used in the 2013 film Frozen. For development, the team used <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> game engine. The development team built {{a relationship with the}} team at Unity Technologies very early in the development of Unity 5 and this allowed them to have their opinions included in the engine. Despite being dependent on <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> 5 engine, the team also customised the game editor portion themselves. The team needed to take differences between different phone models into account to allow high performance. To help with development and overcome potential difficulties handling <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> engine, a special development environment and structure was created. The team used physically based rendering to create realistic lighting and environmental effects. The budget was far lower than graphically equivalent console titles, so the team were reluctant to buy in helping tools and had restrictions on staff numbers: one person was working on all the game's backgrounds, while three were in charge of character designs. Using experience from the development of Final Fantasy XIII, the team were able to create high-end graphics within mobile restrictions.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Rajagopalachari and {{the marchers}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} Civil Disobedience Movement as well as khadi and social issues like caste discrimination. They socialised with the untouchables and refrained from entering the temples in which the former were denied entry. They also swept {{the streets of the}} villages and spoke up for <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of Hindus and Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Firewatch runs on <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science proved <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of all {{man because}} all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., {{all members of}} a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{developed}} by a small team at Ubisoft Reflections for internal release, the game became popular between co-workers and was eventually planned for official release, confirmed in a blog post by Ubisoft on January 22, 2015.

5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of God's will, and he clearly believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E

The internal conflicts that come out from various reasons is an evident of that disintegration. This paper analyzes KH.

It reflects the concordance of faith and could be realized in anti-fanatism attitude in the Muslim society.
