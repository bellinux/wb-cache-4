500|$|The Big 12 Championship Game {{is held by}} the Big 12 Conference each year. The {{championship}} game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. Despite losing {{the last two games}} of the regular season, Colorado retained {{the best record in the}} North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Prior to the game, Colorado head coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I do not think anybody expects us <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> beat Texas." [...] His team lost the game 70–3, the most lopsided score in any college football conference championship to date.|$|E
2500|$|In early November, a {{new video}} was {{released}} from the incident showing Gaines talking into the camera, expressing her exhaustion but concurrent refusal to back down from arriving officers: [...] "I'm at peace. I'm in my home. I ain't trying to hurt nobody. ... They been quiet a while so they plotting <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> disturb the peace. ... I am not a criminal." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Basie {{took his}} {{orchestra}} to New York in 1937, {{they made the}} Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, [...] "We caught the great Count Basie band {{which is supposed to}} be so hot he was going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> set the Roseland on fire. [...] Well, the Roseland is still standing". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.|$|E
60|$|Keep away, Mrs. Pindar. If Mr. Pindar's home, {{find him}} {{and tell him}} not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> This man's crazy.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here! you haven't {{any right}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this fashion," [...] blustered Slugger, {{recovering}} somewhat from his surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall sit by my mother," [...] said Clara. [...] "Everybody seems <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here....</b> Mr. Calthorp, let me {{introduce}} you to Miss Edwards." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{splitting}} {{his time}} in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Class AAA – International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, {{he was the only one}} of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a [...] "leadership role" [...] at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel like I did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I can't {{understand}} why you treat me the way you do," [...] blurted out the shopkeeper. [...] "You promised <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> settle up over a week ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Show {{your men}} {{that you have}} a right <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> I will show them what they may expect if they try to follow, by an example on your own head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot bully me. Now {{that you}} have taken the trouble <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> {{let me tell you}} something. You just cast several {{reflections}} upon our characters. That has got to be stopped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those," [...] said Valentine gravely, [...] "are to {{keep out}} the smell of the halibut. I shouldn't like it <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> She had the lower berth. The top one was Miss Merril's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe I'd {{have dared}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> if I hadn't seen Pussy. But I thought {{anyone who was}} good to her {{would be good to}} me; and now I'm sure of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sa-a-c-r-r-r-e," [...] muttered Raoul {{between his}} teeth; [...] "Etooell, if an Englishman, he {{may very well}} take it into his head <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> perhaps anchor within half-a-cable's length of us! What think you of that, mon brave Américain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm sure," [...] said Briggs, [...] "if I did {{allow him}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> look arter thet sick Mexican, it ain't {{for me to}} be {{expected}} to look after his moril character too." [...] But here the entrance of a customer put a stop to further criticism.|$|E
6000|$|... "To help my boy. I {{want him}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> see the pictures, and let Nanna teach him to plait baskets; {{and he can}} rest, and you will like him, and he might get well if he had some money, and I have three {{quarters}} the friends gave me instead of bonbons. Would that be enough to send poor Giovanni into the country and have doctors?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now leave us, Clara," [...] he said. [...] "You were wrong, my love, {{to be in}} that room, {{and wrong}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> I will speak to you up-stairs--you must remain here no longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The I. W. W.! My God, Orcutt, don't {{you know}} enough not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> {{wasting my time}} talking about the I. W. W.? Those anarchists haven't got any organization. Can't you get that through your head?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The painter continued, bitterly: [...] "You used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> {{the first}} year, with notions of society women {{that would have}} disgraced a Goth, or a gorilla. Did you form your {{estimate}} of Miss Lynde from those premises?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{attempt is}} being made in certain of the most obscure and squalid parts of the Metropolis, where rooms are opened, at night, for the {{gratuitous}} instruction of all comers, children or adults, under the title of RAGGED SCHOOLS. The name implies the purpose. They who are too ragged, wretched, filthy, and forlorn, to enter any other place: who could gain admission into no charity school, and who would be driven from any church door; are invited <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> find some people not depraved, willing to teach them something, and show them some sympathy, and stretch a hand out, {{which is not the}} iron hand of Law, for their correction.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel's head {{began to}} turn giddy. [...] "One thing at a time, sir!" [...] she interposed, with a gesture of entreaty. [...] "The dog sleeps on my bed, and I had a bad night with him, he {{disturbed}} me so, and I am afraid I am very stupid this morning. His name is Tommie. We are obliged to call him by it, because he won't answer to any other than the name he had when my Lady bought him. But we spell it with an i e at the end, which makes it less vulgar than Tommy with a y. I am very sorry, sir--I forget what else you wanted to know. Please <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> my Lady will tell you everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps so, my dear, and {{in theory}} that is, no doubt, the case; but practically, I fancy {{you would find}} {{nineteen}} men out of twenty, {{even if they are}} what you call earnest men, retire from the ranks of hard workers if they come into a nice property. By the way, you must come in here this evening. There is a juggler in the station, and Mr. Hunter has told him to come round. The servants say the man is a very celebrated juggler, {{one of the best in}} India, and as the girls have never seen anything better than the ordinary itinerant conjurers, my husband has arranged for him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> we have been sending notes round asking everyone to come in. We have sent one round to your place, but you must have come out before the chit arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care. I {{intend to}} have him removed. I have taken a frightful dislike to him. He is a prig and a hypocrite, and has no {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this way, setting his low-down Indians up against the settlers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gilbert did {{not seem}} {{inclined}} to hurry his sister as they came near Madame Belmarche's. He lingered, and presently said, 'Should you be too tired <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> for a moment? it was an intolerable shame {{that none of them}} were asked.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't intend you shall," [...] said Mrs. Horncastle. [...] "We {{will stay}} here {{together}} until {{you go with}} me to Hymettus, or until Mr. Van Loo leaves the hotel. He will hardly attempt <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> again if I remain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lying there, still awake, he {{reflected}} that he wouldn't be a scout when he grew up, {{but would be}} something like Mr. Peyton, and have a train like this, and invite the Silsbees and Susy to accompany him. For this purpose, he and Susy, early to-morrow morning, would get permission <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> play at that game. This would familiarize him with the details, {{so that he would}} be able at any time to take charge of it. He was already an authority on the subject of Indians! He had once been fired at--as an Indian. He would always carry a rifle like that hanging from the hooks {{at the end of the}} wagon before him, and would eventually slay many Indians and keep an account of them in a big book like that on the desk. Susy would help him, having grown up a lady, and they would both together issue provisions and rations from the door of the wagon to the gathered crowds. He would be known as the [...] "White Chief," [...] his Indian name being [...] "Suthin of a Pup." [...] He would have a circus van attached to the train, in which he would occasionally perform. He would also have artillery for protection. There would be a terrific engagement, and he would rush into the wagon, heated and blackened with gunpowder; and Susy would put down an account of it in a book, and Mrs. Peyton--for she would be there in some vague capacity--would say, [...] "Really, now, I don't see but what we were very lucky in having such a boy as Clarence with us. I begin to understand him better." [...] And Harry, who, for purposes of vague poetical retaliation, would also drop in at that moment, would mutter and say, [...] "He is certainly the son of Colonel Brant; dear me!" [...] and apologize. And his mother would come in also, in her coldest and most indifferent manner, in a white ball dress, and start and say, [...] "Good gracious, how that boy has grown! I am sorry I did not see more of him when he was young." [...] Yet even in the midst of this came a confusing numbness, and then the side of the wagon seemed to melt away, and he drifted out again alone into the empty desolate plain from which even the sleeping Susy had vanished, and he was left deserted and forgotten. Then all was quiet in the wagon, and only the night wind moving round it. But lo! the lashes of the sleeping White Chief--the dauntless leader, the ruthless destroyer of Indians--were wet with glittering tears! ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{feel sorry}} for any federal agents that want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> try to push us around or {{anything}} like that. I really don't want violence toward them, but if they're going to come bring violence to us, well, if that's the language they want to speak, we'll learn it.|$|E

60|$|CANYNGE. [After {{consulting}} ST ERTH with a look] Ask De Levis to be {{good enough}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> Borring, you might see that Dancy doesn't leave the Club. We shall want him. Don't say anything to him, and use your tact to keep people off.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not long}} before the Widow Keswick, with a brisk, blithe step, entered the parlor. [...] "I couldn't eat without you, Robert," [...] she cried, [...] "and so I really haven't half {{finished}} my dinner.

5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the fight, the audience began chanting [...] "Fix!", having thought Seldon took a dive in order for Tyson to win the championship {{and move on to}} face Evander Holyfield. The crowd would continue to serenade Seldon with chants of [...] "Fix!" [...] as he remained in the ring for an interview with Jim Gray. Gray would openly ask Seldon if he did in fact take a dive, but Seldon professed his innocence, stating [...] "I didn't train 12 weeks <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> take a dive." ...|$|E
5000|$|Succop was {{selected}} 256th overall, the final selection in the 2009 NFL Draft, by the Kansas City Chiefs, earning him {{the title of}} Mr. Irrelevant.

I'm just trying not {{to get caught up}} in it and focus more on the task at hand, which is trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> help the team.

6000|$|The next morning, Mrs. Sharp, then a {{blooming}} abigail of three-and-thirty, {{entered her}} lady's private room and said, 'If you please, my lady, there's the frowsiest, shabbiest man you ever saw, outside, and he's told Mr. Warren as the singing-master {{sent him to}} see your ladyship.
