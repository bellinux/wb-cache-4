5|$|In 2000, paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren {{produced}} a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls, naming several new clades. Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia. Euskelia includes the temnospondyls {{that were once}} called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies, the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea. Dissorophoids include small, mostly terrestrial temnospondyls <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of modern amphibians. Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like Eryops. The second major clade, Limnarchia, includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls, {{as well as some}} Permian groups. Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls, the stereospondyls.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers {{of the wing}} than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time {{from all over the}} world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E

5|$|Osmólska and Roniewicz {{reported}} that the holotype specimen has abnormal pits, grooves and tubercles on {{the first and second}} phalanx of the left second finger <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of injuries to the joint between the two bones. The damage may have caused changes to the arrangement of ligaments of muscles. The two coracoids are also differently developed. A rib of specimen MPC-D 100/127 shows a healed trauma which has remodelled the bone. In 2012, bite marks on two gastralia of the holotype specimen were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behaviour instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E

25|$|During the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar {{brought his}} troops to Cabyllona in 59 BC, he found two Roman wine merchants already {{established}} in business trading {{with the local}} tribes. In places like Bordeaux, Trier and Colchester where Roman garrisons were established, vineyards were planted to supply local need and limit the cost of long-distance trading. Roman settlements were founded and populated by retired soldiers with knowledge of Roman viticulture from their families and life before the military; vineyards were planted in their new homelands. While {{it is possible that}} the Romans imported grapevines from Italy and Greece, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that they cultivated native vines <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of the grapes grown in those provinces today.|$|E

The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport {{as the most important}} for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E

25|$|For {{the making}} of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20years; and the pyramid is square, each side {{measuring}} 800feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than 30feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call 'rows' and others 'bases': When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>the</b> highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.|$|E
