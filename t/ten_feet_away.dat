5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
25|$|Also {{completed}} in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, {{which was designed}} by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> The building received the 1966 RIBA Architecture Award for the West Midlands. It was statutorily listed in 1993. Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of {{a quarter of a}} million pounds.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{it became}} dark, Lippincott went off in the gig, and {{returned}} {{in half an hour}} with the news that there were six feet of water {{at the foot of the}} rock, and twelve <b>feet</b> <b>ten</b> yards <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{shooting}} of Laquan McDonald {{took place on}} October 20, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois. McDonald was shot by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke from approximately <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> (3 m) <b>away.</b> After investigation, Officer Van Dyke was charged in November 2015 with first-degree murder and initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail. He was released on bail on November 30. The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family.|$|R
50|$|Widley {{has three}} local pubs within walking distance. The George Inn {{sits on the}} top of Portsdown Hill and is {{considered}} a fine real ale pub. Further west, approximately <b>ten</b> minutes by <b>foot</b> <b>away</b> from the George, lies the Churchillian. Further North on the A3 lies the Hampshire Rose which is considered a family pub serving pub food and international lagers. All three pubs are within ten minutes of one another by foot.|$|R
500|$|In [...] "Outsiders" [...] a scene {{required}} a lorry crashing {{into a car}} in front of Danny. Oyelowo had to stand <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the crash. The production crew considered having Oyelowo wearing sunglasses to shield his eyes from any possible glass shards, but they later chose against it. There were scenes where some of the characters snorted cocaine. The [...] "cocaine" [...] was in actuality glucose powder that the actors did have to snort. Elsewhere, the crew used vegetable soup as vomit. The alcohol used in the series were made from non-alcoholic drinks; the production crew used fruit juices as wine, ginger ale as brandy, and cold tea as beer.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{condemned}} man limped forward, {{he felt that}} the rope tying his elbows had become loose from the manhandling and had started to drop down! Realizing that his arms had suddenly become free, he quickly decided to run away and darted towards the sugarcane fields right behind the church (now the Holy Angel University campus). The startled executioners seemed paralyzed for a few seconds as Duman dashed away at full speed! The Spaniards were the first to react. They frantically loaded their rifles, aimed at their escaping prisoner who was just barely <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> and fired shot after shot! The bewildered Macabebe civil guards followed suit and started firing deadlier Caliber [...]43 bullets at their fellow Capampangan. Considering the tested accuracy of these then world-class rifles of hitting bulls-eye targets at a distance of 200 yards (roughly 600 feet!), it was incredible how these well-trained professional officers and soldiers could have missed their target, starting from a distance of only ten feet, and after initially firing a total of about twenty shots at their escaping prisoner! ...|$|E
60|$|Hal's heart {{seemed to}} leap into his throat. The horses were not over <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b> A moment more {{and the elderly}} gentleman would be crushed to death.|$|E
50|$|Essentially, {{to make a}} {{fire pit}} only a hole is {{required}} in order to safely contain a fire. This {{can be as simple as}} digging a hole in the ground, or as complex as hollowing out a brick or rock pillar. A wood burning fire pit should be located at least <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> (three metres) <b>away</b> from structures for safety. Use of a fire pit in adverse conditions should be avoided, and basic fire safety precautions apply.|$|R
5000|$|The monuments {{are three}} pairs of stuccoed poured {{concrete}} gateposts, six in total. When closed. the main pair's gate says [...] "The United Daughters of the Confederacy Memorial". Only the main pair have bronze plaques. The main pair are each two <b>feet</b> wide and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> tall, with 27 feet between them. The center pair has no road between them; they are three <b>feet</b> wide, <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> tall, and 285 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the main gates. The third set are 330 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the center gates, two <b>feet</b> wide and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> tall.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly before 10:30 a.m., {{he entered}} Classroom B-1, a special {{education}} classroom where his wife taught at, and walked [...] "a short distance" [...] inside. The 53-year-old teacher {{was standing in the}} middle of the room, about <b>ten</b> to fifteen <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the door. Without saying a word, the man opened fire with a [...] "large-caliber revolver", firing ten rounds and reloading once before shooting himself. Both the gunman and the teacher died. There were fifteen students ranging from the first to fourth grades, along with two teacher's aides, also in the classroom at the time. Two of the students suffered gunshot wounds, with one of them mortally wounded.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he caught}} sight of Tom's head, about <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from the houseboat. A glance showed him that his brother was {{unconscious}} and on the point of sinking again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't. Not yet. Might {{never find}} it. Might get lost <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from it. Sit over in this stall, near the horses. We'll rush {{for the house}} when the {{blizzard}} lifts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{if one of}} the Dutchmen {{who shot}} at Jack had known enough to put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr. Brice, who was only <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> {{standing}} before your son." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{magazine}} shanty {{was totally}} destroyed, leaving a crater fifteen <b>feet</b> across and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> deep. Thomas Fitzpatrick's house was about 200 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> {{from the site}} of the blast and was heavily damaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anywhere {{from right}} against the body up to <b>ten</b> or twelve <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> holding for the stomach, it's astonishing, Mr. Pathurst, {{what you can}} do with a weapon like this. Now you can't use a rifle in a mix-up. I've been down and under, with a bunch giving me the boot, when I turned loose with this. Talk about damage! It ranged them the full length of their bodies. One of them'd just landed his brogans on my face when I let'm have it. The bullet entered just above his knee, smashed the collarbone, where it came out, and then clipped off an ear. I guess that bullet's still going. It took more than a {{full-sized}} man to stop it. So I say, give me a good handy gat when something's doing." ...|$|R
60|$|The runner {{passed them}} a dozen <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> crossed the wet sand, never parsing, till the froth wash was {{to his knees}} while above him, <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> at least, upreared a was of {{overtopping}} water. Huge and powerful as his body had seemed, it was now white and fragile {{in the face of}} that imminent, great-handed buffet of the sea. Saxon gasped with anxiety, and she stole a look at Billy to note that he was tense with watching.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you do, Miss Wetherell?" [...] {{cried the}} young man joyously, while still <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> [...] "I'm awfully glad to see you, upon my word; I am. How long {{are you going to}} be in Washington?" ...|$|E
60|$|The long train roared past, and Reddy {{closed his}} eyes to shut out the dust and smoke. When he opened them again, he looked right into the wide-open mouth of Bowser the Hound, who was not <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|The gloom was {{so dense}} {{that it was}} {{necessary}} Jet should hold on to the leader's coat, otherwise they would speedily have been separated, and a watcher <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> could not have said a human being was passing.|$|E
60|$|A foot {{this side}} the brink the lichens were torn away where the sharp hoofs had cut down to solid earth. Thirty <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> {{well over the}} farther bank and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> below the level where I stood, the fresh earth showed clearly among the hoof-torn moss. Far below, the river fretted and roared in a white rush of rapids. He had taken the jump, a jump that made one's {{nostrils}} spread and his breath come hard as he measured it with his eye. Somewhere, over in the spruces' shadow there, he was hiding, watching me no doubt to see if I would dare follow.|$|R

60|$|Some <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> {{below the}} roof, the wall {{inclined}} slightly inward possibly {{a foot in}} the last <b>ten</b> <b>feet,</b> and here the climbing was indeed immeasurably easier, so that my fingers soon clutched the eaves.|$|R
60|$|Nearer and nearer he came. It {{was a tough}} struggle, for in {{the bend}} of the swollen stream the water boiled and foamed upon all sides. He was yet <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> from Dick, {{when he saw the}} youth sink beneath the surface.|$|E
60|$|Away Hans {{started for}} the stick, running as swiftly as his short legs would carry him. When about <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> he made a wild leap, stuck up both legs in the air, and came down {{flat on his back}} with a loud whack.|$|E
60|$|This {{had hardly}} been done {{when he saw}} a long tongue of flame leap out of the bushes at the right, not more than <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> and a bullet whistled so near his ear that he could hear it shrieking like a minnie ball.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Uncle Randolph, I didn't say {{the pumpkin}} was eight <b>feet</b> high and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> across. I said I {{saw it in}} a {{restaurant}} window eight <b>feet</b> high and <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> across," [...] and Tom drew down {{the corners of his}} mouth soberly.|$|R
50|$|Suppose one {{is looking}} through a window at a 30 ft house 240 <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> so it subtends a visual angle of about 7 degrees. The 30 in window opening is 10 <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> so it subtends a visual angle of 14 degrees.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "navy" [...] {{was some}} forty {{feet in length}} by <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> beam.

6000|$|Colonel Arran, of the Belleplain Argus, {{in another}} corner, not <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away,</b> {{was saying that}} the judge was [...] "a scoundrel, a blow-hard, and would down his best lover for a pewter cent," [...] to all of which the placid judge was {{accustomed}} and gave no heed.|$|E
6000|$|... "This ugly, plain thing," [...] said Nancy, calmly, [...] "was {{copied from}} one that Mrs. Van Alstyne Fisher was wearing. The girls say her {{bill in the}} store last year was $12,000. I made mine, myself. It cost me $1.50. <b>Ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> you couldn't tell it from hers." ...|$|E
60|$|The wretched {{creature}} flung itself again towards {{its only}} door of escape, {{fought with the}} vehemence of despair, to be flung back again, a hideous, bleeding mass of broken flesh. I tried to cling to Hal's arm, but one jerk of his steel muscles flung me <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|About {{twenty yards}} below, a wooded rock, some <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> high, {{hung over the}} stream. The river was not there more than fifteen yards broad; deep near the rock, shallow on the farther side; and Amyas's canoe led the way, within <b>ten</b> <b>feet</b> of the stone.|$|R
