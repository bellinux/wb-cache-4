40|$|Tagging {{graphical}} objects with <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> {{is a fundamental}} task {{in the design of}} many types of informational graphics. This problem is seen in its most essential form in the field of cartography, where <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> must be placed on maps while avoiding overlaps with cartographic symbols and other labels, though it also arises frequently in the production of other graphics (e. g., scatterplots). Although several techniques have bee...|$|R
30|$|Although {{experimental}} studies show show that graphic displays reduce task completion time more significantly than tabular <b>text</b> displays, <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> remain critical in identifying {{elements of the}} display [21]. <b>Text</b> <b>labels</b> are applied in Treemap right after it being created to help orient viewers [22]. Excentric Labeling has been applied in Treemap to show labels in an interactive manner [23]. However, the color and orientation of labels have not been comprehensively studied.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> for objects {{provided}} in LabelMe come from user input, {{there is a}} lot of variation in the labels used (as described above). Because of this, analysis of objects can be difficult. For example, a picture of a dog might be labeled as dog, canine, hound, pooch, or animal. Ideally, when using the data, the object class dog at the abstract level should incorporate all of these <b>text</b> <b>labels.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Text</b> <b>labels</b> in raster maps provide {{valuable}} geospatial information by associating geographical names with geospatial locations. Although present commercial {{optical character recognition}} (OCR) products can achieve a high recognition rate on documents containing text lines of the same orientation, text recognition on raster maps is challenging due to the varying text orientations and the overlap of <b>text</b> <b>labels.</b> This paper presents a text recognition approach that focuses on locating individual <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> in the map and detecting their orientations to then leverage the horizontal text recognition capability of commercial OCR software. We show that our approach detects accurate string orientations and achieves 96. 2 % precision and 94. 7 % recall on character recognition and 80. 6 % precision and 84. 1 % recall on word recognition. 1...|$|R

A 'tile' represents a GUI widget such as a text box or a <b>text</b> <b>label.</b> Tiles also represent widgets that hold other widgets, such as columns, radio button groups and the dialogs themselves. DCL provides built-in tiles for all major widgets, and new tiles can be defined through inheritance and composition of other tiles.|$|E

In this work we combine both 3 D diagrams and <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> by evaluating the legibility of text on 3 D shaded diagram elements. The focus is on using a transparent background for the <b>text</b> <b>labels</b> on the nodes. The investigation seeks to determine whether a transparent background for the node labels can result in better readings of the text and nodes in the diagrams. The results show that using a transparent background on the labels can considerably improve text legibility and maintain node visibility...|$|R

50|$|In graphic design, a {{drop shadow}} is a visual effect {{consisting}} of a drawing element which looks like the shadow of an object, giving {{the impression that the}} object is raised above the objects behind it. The drop shadow is often used for elements of a graphical user interface such as windows or menus, and for simple text. The <b>text</b> <b>label</b> for icons on desktops in many desktop environments has a drop shadow, as this effect effectively distinguishes the text from any colored background it may be in front of.|$|E
50|$|If {{the image}} is not {{completely}} labeled, the user can use the mouse to draw a polygon containing an object in the image. For example, in the adjacent image, if a person {{was standing in front}} of the building, the user could click on a point on the border of the person, and continue clicking along the outside edge until returning to the starting point. Once the polygon is closed, a bubble pops up on the screen which allows the user to enter a label for the object. The user can choose whatever label the user thinks best describes the object. If the user disagrees with the previous labeling of the image, the user can click on the outline polygon of an object and either delete the polygon completely or edit the <b>text</b> <b>label</b> to give it a new name.|$|E

The approach detects the sign in the image by color processing and multi-layer perceptron neural network.

It is important to examine also the <b>text</b> <b>label</b> passo-carrabile as an additional test and to differentiate this specific sign among all other prohibition signs.
