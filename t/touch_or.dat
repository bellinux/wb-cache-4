5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the <b>touch,</b> <b>or</b> surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, atoms, ions, {{electrons and}} the objects they form. This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> squeeze. As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E

5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the <b>touch,</b> <b>or</b> voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.|$|E

25|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Erigavo {{features}} a mild {{version of the}} semi-arid climate. The city generally sees equable temperatures year round, {{with some of the}} mildest weather in all of Somaliland. Despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude, temperatures rarely exceed 30 degrees Celsius. Nights are frequently chilly, even during the summer season. This is a trait shared with very few places in the world; notable locations with similar climate are Sana'a in Yemen or Arequipa in Peru. The city receives on average under 400mm of precipitation annually. Average monthly temperatures range from 14.3 C in the month of December to 19.7 C in the month of July. Absolute minimum temperatures sometimes <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> cross zero degrees Celsius isotherm.|$|E
25|$|The Genius feature, {{introduced}} in iTunes 8, automatically generates a playlist of {{songs from the}} user's library which {{are similar to the}} selected song. Genius playlists are created by the ratings system and collaborative filtering. An iTunes Store account is required because information about the user's library must first be sent anonymously to Apple's database. Algorithms determine which songs to play based on other users' libraries, and Genius becomes more intelligent given a larger data set. The resulting Genius playlist can contain 25, 50, 75, or 100 songs and can be refreshed for new results or saved. Once Genius becomes active in iTunes, it can be used on current generations of the iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>or</b> the iPhone. iTunes 9 added Genius Mixes, where the Genius software finds similar music and automatically puts them into mixes.|$|E
25|$|Dreamscape {{was first}} {{announced}} on April 8, 2014 which {{coincided with the}} release of the reveal trailer. At the same time the game was sent to Apple for review in order to get it onto the App Store. Shortly after Lippert discovered that, due a memory bug, the game would not run on the iPhone 3GS, iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>or</b> original iPad, and decided to pull the game from the review process. Lippert spent the next month working on fixing this issue, and bought an iPad in order to test the game on multiple devices. On May 30, 2011 Lippert announced that the bug had been fixed and that Dreamscape had been resent to Apple for review. A second trailer was released alongside this announcement. Dreamscape was released on June 9, 2011, and became the second game to run on iOS devices using Unreal Engine 3, the first been 2010's Infinity Blade.|$|E

25|$|Rugby seven {{teams have}} seven {{players on the}} field and can {{nominate}} five substitutes, but only three may play any one game. Games last for 14 minutes (7-minute halves) except for finals which can consist of two ten-minute halves. In international competitions there are two ingoal touch judges (one at each end) that assist the referee in determining successful shots at goal, touch in-goal and tries. Conversions are drop goals that must be taken within 40 seconds and the opposition must wait near the halfway. A player temporarily suspended must leave the game for two minutes. The scoring team restarts play by kicking off from the halfway. Free kicks are awarded to the opposition at the halfway if the ball does not travel ten metres, goes directly into <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> into the in-goal, or the kickers team are in front. Scrums are formed with three players.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>or</b> the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to <b>touch</b> <b>or</b> speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to process <b>touching</b> <b>or</b> broken characters in practical applications on optical character recognition. For <b>touching</b> <b>or</b> broken characters, a method based on mathematical morphology of binary image is put forward in the paper. On {{the basis of the}} relative theories of digital image processing, the overall process is introduced including separation of touching characters and connection of broken characters. First of all, character image is pre-processed through smoothing and threshold segmentation in order to generate binary image of characters. Then character regions which are <b>touching</b> <b>or</b> broken are processed through different operators of mathematical morphology of binary image by different structuring elements. Thus the touching characters are separated and broken characters are connected. For higher recognition rate, further processes are done to achieve normal and individual character regions...|$|R
