5|$|Nobody {{could call}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If {{the right of}} conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E

40|$|Remembrance and {{commemoration}} of traumatic historical past {{has become one}} of the major issues of the international museological practice over the last decades. By means of architectural and exhibition design the contemporary museum poses questions concerning history, memory, identity, alternative perceptions of the past and the present. These questions become crucial not only for the self-consciousness and self-identification of certain groups of people, but of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nations,</b> or even of the entire society. The present essay briefly examines a number of these issues in relation to several memorial museums of the last three decades, and poses theoretical questions concerning future museological perspectives on the realm of difficult memories...|$|R

25|$|After the Kalmar War {{broke out}} in 1611, the Danish king tried to revive the {{volunteer}} leidang, with dire results. As the Norwegian citizenry had not been armed or trained {{in the use of}} arms for nearly three centuries they were not able to fight. Soldiers deserted or were captured. The soldiers had to participate in military drills, while providing supplementary labor to the local community when not in active service. Although the army still did not represent <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nation,</b> as city residents were exempt from military duty, 1628 is generally regarded by historians as the year when the modern Norwegian army was born.|$|E

The 1926 All-Union Conference on Antireligious Propaganda voted in favour of Yaroslavsky's views on the antireligious campaign, but the debate still continued. The Moscow group argued that the antireligious struggle should be led only by the party and the industrial proletariat, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nation</b> which Yaroslavsky wanted to mobilize to conduct the antireligious campaign.|$|E
25|$|Richelieu's tenure was {{a crucial}} period of reform for France. Earlier, the nation's {{political}} structure was largely feudal, with powerful nobles and {{a wide variety of}} laws in different regions. Parts of the nobility periodically conspired against the King, raised private armies, and allied themselves with foreign powers. This system gave way to centralized power under Richelieu. Local and even religious interests were subordinated to those of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nation,</b> and of the embodiment of the nation — the King. Equally critical for France was Richelieu's foreign policy, which helped restrain Habsburg influence in Europe. Richelieu did not survive {{to the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. However, the conflict ended in 1648, with France emerging in a far better position than any other power, and the Holy Roman Empire entering a period of decline.|$|E
25|$|The {{first contact}} a {{defendant}} has {{with the criminal}} justice system is usually with the police (or law enforcement) who investigate the suspected wrongdoing and make an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>nation,</b> a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order. The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. The word comes from the Latin politia ("civil administration"), which itself derives from the Ancient Greek πόλις, for polis ("city"). The first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France, although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Marine Police in London, the Glasgow Police, and the Napoleonic police of Paris.|$|E
