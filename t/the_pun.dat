25|$|The spirit {{behind this}} rewritten riddle {{may be best}} {{exemplified}} by a pun in the penultimate line of the Exeter Book version. In the manner of other riddles, the riddle dares us to find the solution, calling the reader searoþoncum gleaw, 'clever with cunning thoughts'. As a separate word, searo has several competing senses. It may designate either a 'device' or the intellectual power that created such a device. But more specifically, searo can mean 'armour'—so <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> reads, 'clever with thoughts of armour'.|$|E

25|$|Following the August 1956 uprising, Lozano Díaz's health {{began to}} deteriorate, but he clung stubbornly to power.

The results seemed to confirm this charge, as <b>the</b> <b>PUN</b> candidates were declared the winners of all fifty-six seats in the congress. The joy of their victories was short, however. On October 21, the armed forces, led by the commanders of the army and air force academies and by Major Roberto Gálvez, the son of the former president, ousted Lozano Díaz and set up a military junta to rule the country.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{differ on}} the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of {{reaching}} above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called [...] "university wits"). The italicised phrase parodying the line [...] "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" [...] from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> [...] "Shake-scene", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer {{with the work of}} others, rather than the more common [...] "universal genius".|$|E
500|$|Four main {{strategies}} {{have been used}} by translators. The first leaves all characters' names unchanged and in their original spelling: thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting, but the liveliness of <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> is lost. Eva Malagoli varied this source-oriented approach by using both the English Christian names and the adjective earnest, thus preserving <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> and the English character of the play, but possibly straining an Italian reader. A third group of translators replaced Ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language, favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original. For instance, in Italian, these versions variously call the play L'importanza di essere Franco/Severo/Fedele, the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety, and loyalty. French offers a closer pun: [...] "" [...] is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness, so the play is commonly known as De l'importance d'être Constant, though Jean Anouilh translated the play under the title: Il est important d'être Aimé ("" [...] is a name which also means [...] "beloved"). These translators differ in their attitude to the original English honorific titles, some change them all, or none, but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of Englishness. Lastly, one translation gave the name an Italianate touch by rendering it as Ernesto; this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages.|$|E

500|$|Before Alexandru Ghica was {{replaced}} with Gheorghe Bibescu, his relations with Heliade had soured. In contrast with his earlier call for moderation, the writer decided {{to side with the}} liberal current in its conspiratorial opposition to Bibescu. The so-called [...] "Trandafiloff affair" [...] of early 1844 was essential in this process—it was provoked by Bibescu's decision to lease all Wallachian mines to a Russian engineer named Alexander Trandafiloff, a measure considered illegal by the Assembly and ultimately ending in Bibescu's decision to dissolve his legislative. These events made Heliade publish a pamphlet titled Măceşul ("The Eglantine"), which was heavily critical of Russian influence and reportedly sold over 30,000 copies. It was centered on <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> alluding to Trandafiloff's name—trandafir cu of în coadă (lit. [...] "a rose ending in -of", but also [...] "a rose with grief for a stem").

500|$|Work resumed on Living in the Material World over January and February, with Hussain and Jim Horn {{among those}} making {{contributions}} to the overdubs on the title track. Over the two [...] "spiritual sky" [...] sections, Hussain added tabla, replacing the rock rhythm section, while Horn played flute and Harrison played sitar. Author Alan Clayson likens Harrison's production style on Material World to that of Beatles producer George Martin and notes that [...] "this moderation resulted in arrangements flexible enough for the title track to flit smoothly" [...] between the contrasting rock and [...] "celestial" [...] Indian sections. The use of Indian instrumentation recalls Harrison's work with the Beatles during 1966–68, following which, Harrison admitted, he rarely played the sitar. Adding to <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> behind the [...] "Richie" [...] line in the verse referencing the Beatles, Starr provides a drum fill; later in the track, Horn's flute similarly acknowledges the mention of Krishna – flute being synonymous with Krishna in the Hindu faith.|$|E

500|$|The Importance of Being Earnests {{popularity}} has meant {{it has been}} translated into many languages, though the homophonous pun in the title ("", a masculine proper name, and [...] "", the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness) poses a special problem for translators. The easiest case of a suitable translation of <b>the</b> <b>pun,</b> perpetuating its sense and meaning, may have been its translation into German. Since English and German are closely related languages, German provides an equivalent adjective ("ernst") and also a matching masculine proper name ("Ernst"). The meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same. Yet {{there are many different}} possible titles in German, mostly concerning sentence structure. The two most common ones are [...] "Bunbury oder ernst / Ernst sein ist alles" [...] and [...] "Bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist, ernst / Ernst zu sein". In a study of Italian translations, Adrian Pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles. Since wordplay is often unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original—in this case the English adjective and virtue earnest—or creating a similar pun in their own language.|$|E
500|$|La Rivière {{argues that}} the use of the Tiger Moth as the star vehicle, and <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> on the Esso promotional banner of [...] "Put a Tiger in Your Tank", are more suited to an adult audience. Meanwhile, {{children}} [...] "had spent the entire 90 minutes eagerly waiting for the most fantastic piece of hardware to arrive. They got an old plane." [...] Thunderbirds historian John Marriott voices similar criticism of the Tiger Moth, writing that [...] "the big screen was an unsuitable place for the gentle irony of steam-age technology scoring triumphantly over an array of fantasy machines." [...] Science-fiction author John Peel is dismissive of the film in general and compares it pessimistically to the [...] "well-made fun" [...] of Thunderbirds Are Go. He summarises it as a [...] "big mistake" [...] and [...] "a feeble last fling for a brilliant series", with a long and illogical plot, poor jokes and little action during the final rescue sequences. Responding to claims that the tone of Thunderbird 6 differs significantly from that of its predecessor, Gerry Anderson maintains that the time that had elapsed since the airing of the final television episode meant that [...] "we were much more aware with the second one that it wasn't just a question of making a longer episode, but it was, indeed, to make something special for the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Tzara {{nonetheless}} {{rebelled against}} his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also {{belonged to the}} avant-garde trend, notably Benjamin Fondane and George Bacovia. Like {{in the cases of}} Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to Western Europe as a [...] "modern, voluntarist" [...] means of breaking with [...] "the peripheral condition", which may also serve to explain <b>the</b> <b>pun</b> he selected for a pseudonym. According to the same author, two important elements in this process were [...] "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an [...] "Oedipus complex" [...] which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to Mateiu Caragiale. Unlike Vinea and the Contimporanul group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate. In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with Zürich serving as a stage on his way to Paris. The 1916 Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto featured a cosmopolitan appeal: [...] "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates." ...|$|E
