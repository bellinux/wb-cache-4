40|$|Gasification of spent lignin pellets {{was used}} to obtain a gas {{suitable}} for energy production. Spent lignin was obtained from second-generation cellulosic ethanol demo plant using wheat straw as feedstock. Gasification of lignin did not give rise to any feeding problems, thus no significant changes were needed in the existing gasification installation. The rise of temperature and steam flow rate favoured the formation of H 2, while hydrocarbons (CnHm) and <b>tar</b> <b>contents</b> decreased. The increase of equivalent ratio (ER) also decreased hydrocarbons and <b>tar</b> <b>contents,</b> but syngas higher heating value (HHV) was reduced.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tar {{formation}} {{is one of}} the major problems to deal with during biomass gasification. To overcome with this problem a nickel-enriched catalytic bed material has been developed and was tested in a 100 kWth dual fluidized bed biomass steam gasifier. Different mixtures of olivine and catalyst (Ni-olivine) were used at different gasification temperatures (from 750 °C to 900 °C) and steam-to-fuel ratios (from 0. 3 to 0. 9). Gas composition and <b>tar</b> <b>contents</b> were analyzed using standardized methods. Water conversion rates, gas yields, and lower heating values were determined from mass and energy balances. The catalyst showed high activity in steam reforming of methane and tars and showed no noticeable deactivation during all experiments. The use of such an in-bed catalyst could be sufficient to produce a clean product gas and eliminating the need of downstream tar removal techniques...|$|R

40|$|For {{ecological}} and economic reasons, there has {{in recent years}} been an increased tendency also to use broken-up asphalt {{in the manufacture of}} asphalt mixes. In the case of broken-up materials having higher <b>tar</b> <b>contents,</b> this is possible only with the aid of cold-processing methods. For this reason, the environmental compatibility and practical applicability of two of these methods were tested in experiments in the laboratory and on site. Use of granulated material having pure tar as a binder created a very critical boundary condition in terms of the material composition. The leached contents of harmful substances from granulated material with pure tar also showed that, for water conservation reasons, such a material cannot be used unbound. After binding of such tarry broken-up road materials with asphaltic emulsion and cement, or cement alone, the leaching is reduced, with the result that such construction material mixtures can be placed in base courses above a frost blanket course.

40|$|Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) {{is a major}} source of human {{exposure}} to airborne particles. In order to provide more information necessary for human exposure investigations, the aim of the work presented here is to investigate experimentally the variation of the ETS particle concentration and size distribution under an actual indoor environment, in a room of 30 m 3, using human smokers. The effect of number of cigarettes and brands of cigarettes, the effect of sampling location and the effect of ventilation rates were investigated. The results indicated little difference in the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the ETS particles from those in background air. Under a ventilation rate of 0. 03 m 3 /s, the concentration of the ETS particles reached a peak value at the sampling point shortly after completing the smoking process. The GMD first increased due to coagulation and diffusion deposition, and finalize decreased due to the effect of ventilation. Smoking two cigarettes at the same time would increase the initial concentration and led to an increase in GMD of the ETS particles. Two different brands of cigarette with different <b>tar</b> <b>contents</b> released ETS particles of different GMDs but similar particle concentrations.

40|$|The need {{to produce}} energy from poor quality {{carbonaceous}} materials has increased, {{in order to}} reduce European dependency on imported fuels, diversify the use of new and alternative fuels and to guarantee secure energy production routes. The valorisation of a poor quality solid residual fuel (SRF), with high content of ash and volatile matter, through its conversion into fuel gas was studied. The rise of gasification temperature and equivalent ratio (ER) led to higher gas yields and to lower undesirable gaseous components, though higher ER values led to a gas with lower energetic content. To reduce the negative effect of SRF unfavourable characteristics and to diversify the feedstocks used, SRF blended with three different types of biomass wastes: forestry pine, almond shells and olive bagasse was co-gasified. The use of biomass wastes tested was valuable for SRF gasification, as there was an increase in the overall reactivity and in H 2 production and a reduction of about 55 % in tar released, without great changes in gas yield and in its HHV. The use of natural minerals mixed with silica sand was also studied with the aim of improving SRF gasification performance and fuel gas quality. The best results were obtained in presence of dolomite, as the lowest tar and H 2 S contents were obtained, while an increase in gas yield was observed. Co-gasification of this poor quality SRF blended with biomass wastes in presence of dolomite increased gas yield by 25 % while <b>tar</b> <b>contents</b> decreased by 55 %...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with carcinogenesis owing to the mutagenic and genotoxic effects of cigarette smoke. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects of Korean cigarettes using in vitro assays. Methods We selected 2 types of cigarettes (TL and TW) as benchmark Korean cigarettes for this study, because they represent the greatest level of nicotine and <b>tar</b> <b>contents</b> among Korean cigarettes. Mutagenic potency was expressed as the number of revertants per μg of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) total particulate matter whereas genotoxic potency was expressed as a concentration-dependent induction factor. The CSC was prepared by the International Organization for Standardization 3308 smoking method. CHO-K 1 cells were used in vitro micronucleus (MNvit) and comet assays. Two strains of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica; TA 98 and TA 1537) were employed in Ames tests. Results All CSCs showed mutagenicity in the TA 98 and TA 1537 strains. In addition, DNA damage and micronuclei formation were observed in the comet and MNvit assays owing to CSC exposure. The CSC from the 3 R 4 F Kentucky reference (3 R 4 F) cigarette produced the most severe mutagenic and genotoxic potencies, followed by the CSC from the TL cigarette, whereas the CSC from the TW cigarette produced the least severe mutagenic and genotoxic potencies. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the mutagenic and genotoxic potencies of the TL and TW cigarettes were weaker than those of the 3 R 4 F cigarette. Further study on standardized concepts of toxic equivalents for cigarettes needs to be conducted for more extensive use of in vitro tests...|$|R

40|$|The world annual {{production}} of rice {{is higher than}} 700. 7 million tons, which generates rice husk and straw wastes. Rice culture also produces big amounts of polyethylene (PE) bags used in rice packs and for seeds and fertilizer storage that usually end up in landfills, due to their degree of contamination. The energetic valorisation of these wastes may be accomplished by different processes, co-gasification {{is one of the}} most viable, as it leads to the {{production of}} a synthetic gaseous mixture (bio-syngas) that can be used for energy production to be used during rice milling processes. Gasification of rice husks has some challenges, due to these wastes high content of silica and alkali metals that lead to the formation of solids with lower melting point, thus, leading to bed agglomeration that causes reactor erosion and serious damage. PE has lower ash content and much higher energetic content than rice husks. However, PE polymeric structure may lead to the formation of higher <b>tar</b> <b>contents,</b> which compromise most gasification gas utilisations. Co-gasification of PE and rice husks allows taking advantages of each waste favourable characteristic, diluting the unsuitable features. Co-gasification of these wastes was done in presence of steam blended with air or oxygen. Steam promoted the gasification reactions and favoured H 2 production. Air or oxygen promoted the partial oxidation of the feedstocks to be co-gasified and supplied the energy necessary for the endothermic gasification reactions. The use of air has a low cost, but has the great disadvantage of diluting the bio-syngas produced, thus lowering its energetic content. On the other hand, the use of oxygen solves the problems related to gas dilution with nitrogen, but increases the operating cost. Bio-syngas composition obtained by co-gasification trials done with air enriched with different oxygen contents was compared with those obtained with air or pure oxygen to determine the best approach considering both the technical and economical sustainability...|$|R
