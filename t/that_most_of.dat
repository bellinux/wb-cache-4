5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) note <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Greece runestones {{are from}} Uppland and relate {{it to the}} fact that it was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies has been <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies {{are associated with}} only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, {{with only a few}} showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

5|$|According {{to several}} journalists {{who have worked}} {{independently}} on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} factors have led to wide {{speculation}} <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and encased in concrete. It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided {{the popularity of the}} story.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E

The models are consistent with observations of widely dispersed hot spots on the Io surface <b>that</b> radiate <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Io's heat loss.

5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the country's other major infrastructure remained functional. They {{estimated that the}} cost to clean {{up all of the}} roads and drains was $900,000 and the cost to repair the utilities and communications damage was another $505,000. Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, but none of these sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered by the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy {{before and after the}} first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
