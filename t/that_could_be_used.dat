5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as evidence.|$|E

5|$|Claims of {{short-lived}} lunar phenomena go back {{at least}} 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or reputable scientists. Nevertheless, the majority of transient lunar phenomenon reports are irreproducible and do not possess adequate control experiments <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to distinguish among alternative hypotheses to explain their origins.|$|E
5|$|He {{waited for}} a {{solution}} to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied {{the solution to the}} problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to solve the infinitely nested radicals problem.|$|E
5|$|Initially, various {{theories}} existed {{about the}} exact {{cause of the}} low platelets in HIT. Gradually, evidence accumulated on the exact underlying mechanism. In 1984-1986, John G.

5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by the imaging system.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} {{solar energy}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by humans {{differs from the}} amount of solar energy present near {{the surface of the}} planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.|$|E

5|$|Heaphy's {{contract}} with the company was for three years, primarily to create art <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as advertising for the company. In doing so he travelled extensively {{around the country and}} occasionally participated in overland treks, living out of a tent or staying with local Māori. He also sailed around parts of the country aboard the Tory and learned surveying from its captain. Another employee of the company travelling on the Tory was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, Russian {{authorities}} arrested nine individuals {{connected to}} a ransomware Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million.|$|E

5|$|Parker and Colesberry {{looked at}} {{locations}} near Jackson, Mississippi, where {{they set up}} production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. They also visited Canton, Mississippi before travelling to Vaiden, Mississippi, where they scouted more than 200 courthouses <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for filming. Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being shot {{in a number of}} locales in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would {{come into contact with}} the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|The County Divisions, {{including}} the Devon and Cornwall County Division, were around 10,000 men strong and assigned {{to defend the}} coastlines of threatened sections of the country, {{including the}} manning of coastal artillery. These divisions were largely static, lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery, engineers, and reconnaissance forces. Using the recruits in this manner allowed the regular infantry divisions to be freed up from such duties, undertake training, and form an all-important reserve <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to counterattack any possible German landing.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 Durso et al. {{were able}} to show <b>that</b> facial EMG <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to detect confusion, both in {{participants}} who admitted being confused and in those who did not, suggesting <b>that</b> it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an effective addition to a sensor suite as a monitor of loss of understanding or loss of situation awareness.|$|R

5|$|The Polikarpov design bureau (OKB) was ordered, in 1936, {{to begin}} {{development}} of a fast twin-engined aircraft <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for ground attack duties and as a heavy fighter. It delivered the ground attack version the following year for evaluation, although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but {{it was decided to}} give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.|$|E
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and {{did not include the}} tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E

50|$|The colonial {{aircraft}} {{were expected}} to have to use basic or unprepared strips, so needed a robust undercarriage. The R.16 had large 1150 mm diameter wheels, independently mounted and fitted with brakes <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> for steering, enclosed under large fairings. Each wheel was on a cranked steel half axle from the lower fuselage with a trailing recoil strut and a vertical oleo leg to the engine mounting.|$|R
50|$|Pets are {{available}} to all players through quests, monster drops and from the ingame pet shop. There are three main categories of pets: Normal, Rideable and Piggyback pets. A fourth type, the Weapon Spirits, was included with SAGA 11. Most pets have their own set of skills <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> to the master's benefit. All pets must be equipped before they can fight (or flee) along their masters.|$|R
