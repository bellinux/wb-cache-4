5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> gate dates from 1901. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when <b>the</b> <b>present</b> wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

40|$|Organisations {{can gain}} {{competitive}} advantage by taking risks within their market. An organisation may promote a particular approach to business opportunities within its employees. Increasingly organisations within a “knowledge-based economy ” trade in information assets. A simple example {{may be an}} employee travelling to a potential client’s premises to present details of their organisation’s work. Here the asset is <b>the</b> work being <b>presented,</b> which has value to <b>the</b> <b>presenting</b> party.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>presented</b> coder {{is based}} on an {{adaptive}} signal transformation technique, that is, the content of the signal and the dictionary of basis functions used to model the signal {{play an important role in}} determining how compact a signal can be represented (compressed). Hence, VBR (Variable Bit Rate) is the best way to <b>present</b> <b>the</b> performance benefit of using an adaptive decomposition approach. The inherent variability introduced in the number of TF functions required to model a signal and thereby the compression is one of the highlights of using ATFT. Although VBR would be more appropriate to <b>present</b> <b>the</b> performance benefit of <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> coder, CBR mode has its own advantages when using with applications that demand network transmissions over constant bitrate channels with limited delays. <b>The</b> <b>presented</b> coder can also be used in CBR mode by fixing the number of TF functions used for representing signal segments, however due to the signal adaptive nature of <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> coder this would compromise the quality at instances where signal segments demand a higher number of TF functions for perceptually lossless reproduction. Hence we choose to <b>present</b> <b>the</b> results of <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> coder using only the VBR mode.|$|R
