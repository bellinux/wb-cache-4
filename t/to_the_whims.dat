5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method <b>to</b> approach <b>the</b> missing baryons problem. We assume that the missing baryons reside in a form of Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> Our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent large scale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the Cosmic Web and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> (b) map its luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numerical simulations <b>to</b> relate <b>the</b> luminosity density <b>to</b> <b>the</b> density of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> (d) apply this relation to real data <b>to</b> trace <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> using <b>the</b> observed galaxy luminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2 dF redshift surveys. In our application we find evidence for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> along <b>the</b> line of sight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sculptor Wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported X-ray absorption line detections.

Ordinarily an engraver, such as William Hogarth, had his own shop or took his finished engravings to a publisher. In adopting the dual role of artist and print dealer, Boydell altered the traditional organisation of print shops. He was not subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of public taste: if his engraves did not sell well, he could supplement his earnings by trading in the prints of other artists.

For example, Gipsy Babes (1826), perhaps inspired by Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815), emphasizes [...] "human affections." [...] In 1835, she published a Gothic novel for adolescents titled Shanty the Blacksmith; it employs all the tropes of the genre—"lost heir, ruined castle, humble helpers and faithful retainer, sinister and mysterious gypsies, prisoner and plot" [...] in what Cutt calls [...] "a gripping" [...] and [...] "exciting tale." [...] In 1835 Sherwood published the novel Caroline Mordaunt; {{it tells the}} story of a young woman forced to become a governess. Her parents die when she is young, but luckily her relatives pay to educate her so that she can earn her own living. The novel follows her progress from a flighty, discontented girl to a reliable, content woman; she learns how to accommodate herself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of the proud nobility, silly literati, and dogmatic evangelicals. She realizes that in her dependent position she must content herself with less than complete happiness. Once she recognizes this, though, she finds God and, in the last chapter, an ideal husband, thus granting her near complete happiness.

The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice.

The British historian Edgar Feuchtwanger wrote that Schleicher's rapid rise and fall from power was due to the system of presidential government he had created in 1930, as the system of presidential government reduced almost everything down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of President Hindenburg, and gave enormous power to those like Papen who happened to enjoy Hindenburg's trust and favor.

On institutional grounds, Papen should had been in a weak position as he was a very unpopular former Chancellor without a seat in the Reichstag or even a political party, whose influence was based entirely on his friendship with Hindenburg.

2500|$|... 1835 was an {{important}} year for American labor with many workers particularly in [...] Boston, Philadelphia, New York City and Washington DC petitioning for higher wages, better working conditions [...] and a ten hour work day. In Washington D.C. from early {{in the nineteenth century}} many workers agitated for a reduction in the arduous twelve hour workday. [...] At the navy yard employment conditions, and enslaved labor created problems and strife. For the first thirty years of the nineteen century, the navy yard was the Districts principal employer of enslaved African Americans. White workers fearing job competition and a reduction in wages resented the presence of blacks on the navy yard. On the Yard enslaved African Americans worked as seamen, cooks, servants or laborers; they performed many of the most unpleasant and onerous jobs. The number of blacks free and enslaved rose rapidly and by 1808, muster lists reflect they made up one third of the workforce. On the navy yard slaveholders included both naval officers and senior civilians who collected the wages of their slaves, rented to the navy yard. [...] Labor trouble and racial tension broke out periodically as the restive and volatile workforce sought higher wages and better conditions. Most all naval shipyard workers were per diem or day labor. As such they were subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of the annual Congressional appropriation and periodic seasonal reductions [...] in the workforce. Workers during the early nineteenth century lived in a state of constant anxiety regarding employment and wages. Wages were subject to considerable change, in some cases daily pay fluctuated dramatically, e.g. WNY carpenters wages were reduced from a high of $2.50 per day in the year 1808 to $1.64 per day in 1820. [...] Workers actively responded, as early as March 1807; the blacksmiths writing to the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith claimed the “right to Demand an Equal Participation with others in the Benefit of our Labour” and their wages restored. The Secretary in response labeled them “a dissatisfied set of men” and threatened to “dismiss all complaining men as soon as publick convenience will permit…” and replace them with a “set of orderly, hard working fellows…” [...] Two Washington Navy Yard “job actions” had occurred previously. [...] The first on 13 March 1827, when a dispute over wages provoked laborers to leave the yard briefly to express their displeasure. The second began on 23 March 1830, when the laborers were recorded “standing out” for a week to show that their per diem wage rate should have been granted sooner. Except for the brief entries made by the officer of the watch however in the station log, {{little is known about the}} exact circumstances of either incident. These job actions represent a period when federal workers, though not unionized [...] could strike - an option later denied to government [...] employees with the passage of the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act. The workday in the all federal navy yards prior to 1835 was sunrise to sunset, with time off for breakfast and lunch. In May 1835, the Boston carpenters issued their famous “Ten Hour Circular,” advocating a ten hour day which found wide distribution throughout the major cities on the eastern seaboard and the District of Columbia and quickly became a rallying cry for reducing the length of the working day. Early in 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, but their petition was returned to them with the advice, [...] " [...] that to grant it would not be in the interest of the government." ...|$|E
