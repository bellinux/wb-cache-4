5|$|The port {{remained}} open {{to service}} the papermills, importing wood pulp and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after World War II. Requiring a return load, {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the <b>temporary</b> <b>detention</b> of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E

California, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the United States Supreme Court {{clarified}} when police officers may make arrests or conduct <b>temporary</b> <b>detentions</b> based on information provided by anonymous tips. In 2008, police in California received a 911 call that a pickup truck was driving recklessly along a rural highway. Officers spotted a truck matching the description provided in the 911 call and followed the truck for five minutes, but did not observe any suspicious behavior. Nevertheless, officers conducted a traffic stop and discovered [...] of marijuana in the truck. At trial, the occupants of the car argued that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, because the tip was unreliable, and officers did not personally observe criminal activity. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call was reliable, and that officers need not personally observe criminal activity when acting upon information provided by an anonymous 911 call.|$|R

Seven years after Gates, the Supreme Court held in Alabama v. White that an anonymous tip was sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to justify a <b>temporary</b> <b>detention,</b> because the tip accurately predicted several key details. Although the Court conceded that White was a [...] "close case", the tip in question [...] "exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability" [...] to justify a <b>temporary</b> <b>detention.</b> The Court explained that [...] if [...] "an informant is shown to be right about some things, he is probably right about other facts that he has alleged, including {{the claim that the}} object of the tip is engaged in criminal activity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of Colonel Karl Bendetsen, existing facilities had been designated for conversion to WCCA use in March 1942, and the Army Corps of Engineers finished construction on these sites on April 21, 1942.

The stables and livestock areas were cleaned out and hastily converted to living quarters for families of up to six, while wood and tarpaper barracks were constructed for additional housing, as well as communal latrines, laundry facilities and mess halls.

40|$|Objectives : Notwithstanding recent {{migration}} policy amendments, {{there is concern}} that Australian asylum policies have disproportionately burdened the health and wellbeing of onshore asylum seekers. There may be a {{case to be made}} that Australian governments have been in violation of the right to health of this population. The objective {{of this paper is to}} critically examine these issues and assess the implications for public health practice. Methods :The author undertook a review of the recent empirical literature on the health effects of post-migration stressors arising from Australian policies of immigration <b>detention,</b> <b>temporary</b> protection and the restriction of Medicare to some asylum seekers. This evidence was examined within the context of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s international law obligations. Results : Findings reveal that Australian asylum policies of <b>detention,</b> <b>temporary</b> protection and the exclusion of some asylum seekers from Medicare rights have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes for this population. This is attributable to the impact of these policies on accessing health care and the underlying determinants of health for aslyum seekers. Conclusion : It is arguable that Australian Governments have been discriminating against asylum seekers by withholding access on the grounds of their migration status, to health care and to the core determinants of health in this context. In so doing, Australia may have been in violation of its obligation to respect the right to health of this population. Implications : While the 2 ̆ 7 right to health 2 ̆ 7 framework has much to offer public health, it is an undervalued and poorly understood discipline. The author argues for more education, research and advocacy around the intersection between heath and human rights...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of asylum seekers and irregular migrants presenting as ʻboat peopleʼ. We evaluate key aspects of policies introduced to deter and contain these people – namely mandatory <b>detention,</b> <b>temporary</b> protection visas and offshore processing. Given {{the high rate of}} deaths and injuries associated with unauthorised boat arrivals, we argue that governments should do their best to discourage or prevent people from attempting to enter Australia in this way. However, the available evidence suggests that the rationale underlying deterrent policies is inherently flawed. Most have been totally ineffective in stopping unauthorised boat arrivals. History suggests that the best strategies prevent rather than deter, stopping the flow of asylum seekers at source and/or diverting desperate people away from dangerous and irregular modes of transport. We argue that no Australian government, acting alone, will be able to beat the people-smugglers now plying their trade out of Indonesia. What is needed are cooperative arrangements with ʻsource ʼ or transit governments, coupled with targeted resettlement programs to provide refugees with viable protection options. We challenge claims made about the effectiveness of the Howard governmentʼs Pacific Solution and question Laborʼs apparent acceptance that offshore processing in ʻregional ʼ centres will stop the boats. We ask whether the Conservatives ʼ loud and internationally publicised claims that Labor has ʻgone soft ʼ on border contro...|$|R
6000|$|Lise was {{the only}} member of the Bumpus family who did not find uncongenial such distractions and companionships as were offered by the civilization that {{surrounded}} them. The Bagatelle she despised; that was slavery--but slavery out of which she might any day be snatched, like Leila Hawtrey, by a prince charming who had made a success in life. Success to Lise meant money. Although what some sentimental sociologists might call a victim of our civilization, Lise would not have changed it, since it produced not only Lise herself, but also those fabulous financiers with yachts and motors and town and country houses she read about in the supplements of the Sunday newspapers. It contained her purgatory, which she regarded in good conventional fashion as a mere <b>temporary</b> place of <b>detention,</b> and likewise the heaven toward which she strained, the dwelling-place of light. In short, her philosophy was that of the modern, orthodox American, tinged by a somewhat commercialized Sunday school tradition of an earlier day, and highly approved by the censors of the movies. The peculiar kind of abstinence once euphemistically known as [...] "virtue," [...] particularly if it were combined with beauty, never failed of its reward. Lise, in this sense, was indeed virtuous, and her mirror told her she was beautiful.
