This research proposes a unification of provisions relating <b>the</b> <b>winding-up</b> of both solvent and insolvent companies in a single piece of legislation. Chapter 1 introduces the dissertation. Chapter 2 consists of a brief overview of the development of corporate law in South Africa. Chapter 3 will focus on a descriptive and comparative approach illustrating between single and dual systems, specifically those in between the USA and England, as well as discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the systems. Chapter 4 contains a discussion on the relationship between the 1973 and 2008 Companies Acts in view of their respective liquidation proceedings of insolvent companies. Chapter 5 consists of an analysis of the Draft Bill Proposals in context of a unified bill and corporate legislation. Lastly, Chapter 6 will draw conclusions.
