5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E

Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 June, the Allied {{meteorological}} team, headed by Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force, predicted that the weather would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go ahead on 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at Southwick House in Hampshire to discuss the situation. General Montgomery and Major General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory {{expressed concern that the}} conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead. Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to as much information as the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers, the II Corps {{had three}} options: to {{pass to the}} east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, {{although}} water would be a problem in that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the country to the south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E
5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated.

50|$|The episode, and the series, {{almost never}} {{happened}} {{due to an}} electricians strike at the BBC in 1987 which prevented filming and the project was shelved. Filming eventually went ahead after the industrial action was resolved.
