40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess whether}} the therapeutic aspects of published international asthma management guidelines are practically applicable in developing countries. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to expatriate doctors working in developing countries. RESULTS: Forty one replies were received from 24 countries in Africa and Asia. Oral salbutamol was prescribed "usually" or "often" by 35 of the 41 respondents, <b>theophyllines</b> by 30, inhaled bronchodilators by 12, inhaled steroids by two, and cromoglycate by two. <b>Theophyllines</b> were locally available in all 41 cases, oral salbutamol in 40, inhaled bronchodilators in 34, and inhaled steroids (usually beclomethasone 50 micrograms) in only 15. Where they were available, the median (range) coat of a beclomethasone 50 micrograms inhaler was 20 % (6. 8 - 100 %) of average local monthly income, salbutamol inhaler 13 % (3. 3 - 250 %), 90 salbutamol 4 mg tablets 3. 8 % (0. 8 - 75 %), and 90 aminophylline 100 mg tablets 4. 5 % (0. 5 - 70 %).

In contrast to their effects in vasopressin-treated bladders, the anesthetics do not inhibit cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow, consistent with an effect on vasopressin-responsive adenylate cyclase.

The best-studied case of the potential contribution of pharmacogenomics to treatment response in asthma comes from studies on human β 2 adrenergic receptors. In addition, genetic variation in β 2 -adrenergic receptor (Arg 16 Gly) may predict response to anticholinergics for the treatment of asthma. In case of inhaled corticosteroids, a recent investigation using a traditional SNP-based approach identified a gene for corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 as a potential marker of response. Another major pathway that has been investigated is the pathway underlying response to cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist.

Jacob aa It is of significant concern that the death rate from as-thma has stabilized and not further decreased {{during the last few}} years in most countries around the world [1]. Cur-rently, inhaled β 2 -adrenergic agonists are the mainstay of therapy in patients with acute asthma. Often they need to be given as frequently as every 20 min, or even as a con-tinuous nebulization along with steroids to achieve ade-quate control [2, 3]. <b>Theophyllines</b> have a low therapeutic index and frequent side-effects, making them increasingly unpopular [4]. There is, therefore, a need for the assess-ment of newer modalities of treatment. Numerous recent studies and case reports have des-cribed the use of intravenous {{magnesium sulphate}} (MgSO 4) to reverse bronchospasm in acute asthma [5 – 17]. A few studies are available on nebulized MgSO 4 as a helpful ag-ent to decrease airway resistance in bronchial challenge tests [18 – 20].

Typically the syndrome manifests in two phases: initial capillary leak phase characterized by generalized edema, serous effusion and hypotension which is followed by phase of volume overload or recruitment phase.

Prognosis, however, is poor in most of the patients. The important parameters of CLS are summarized: • CLS is due to increased capillary permeability from various etiologies. • Inflammatory mediators {{play a key role in}} CLS. • Diagnostic features of CLS are hemoconcentration, hypotension, generalized edema and hypoalbuminemia without albuminuria. • Fluid resuscitation is essential in the initial phase of CLS. • Clinical signs of volume overload herald the second phase of CLS which require diuretic/ ultrafiltration therapy. • In some specific conditions colloid has been found superior to crystalloids. • Vasopressor support/vasoconstrictors may be required based on the clinical setting. • <b>Theophyllines,</b> terbutaline, leucotriene inhibitors have been shown to be of benefit in SCLS. Withdrawal of offending medication usually causes improvement in drug associated CLS. Management of snake bite/sepsis/VHF associated CLS is mainly supportive; steroids may cause some benefit.
