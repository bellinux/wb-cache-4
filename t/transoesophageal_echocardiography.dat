The PVFV values were compared between transthoracic and <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> within the age groups, and intraindividually between {{the right and left}} upper pulmonary veins in <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography.</b>  RESULTS—Normal PVFV values for the right upper pulmonary vein in transthoracic and <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> are presented. The duration of flow reversal at atrial contraction was overestimated using transthoracic echocardiography (mean (SD) : 96  (21)  ms in <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography,</b> 120  (28)  ms in transthoracic echocardiography, p <  0. 0001).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{coronary}} vascular reserve {{stems from the}} description of coronary autoregulation by Mosher in 1964. Schematically, the coronary blood flow at rest depends on the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate, con-tractility and ventricular load). If maximal coronary vasodilation is produced, it results in a linear and steep pressure-flow relationship. The increment of coronary flow above its basal value is called the coronary flow reserve, which indicates the flow added to the basal flow for a given coronary perfusion pressure when the coronary vascular bed is maximally dilated. Thus, {{in the absence of}} epicardial coronary artery stenosis, the maximal coronary flow {{is a function of the}} coronary perfusion pressure and of the maximal surface area of the coronary circulation at the resistance vessel level. Evaluation of the coronary reserve in humans raises three major concerns: (I) methods for measuring or evaluating coronary flow are imprecise and inconvenient (diffusible indicators), invasive (coronary sinus thermodilution, intracoronary Doppler), expensive and require sophisticated technology (ultrafast computed tomography, positron emision tomography), or in the process of being validated (contrast <b>echocardiography,</b> <b>transoesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography,</b> myocardial scintigraphy); (2) the compounds used to produce maximal coronary vasodilation are administered either by the intracor-onary route (papaverine) or intravenously (dipyridamole, adenosine); (3) how to interpret the data: is the alteration of the coronary reserve due to a modification of the basal coronary flow or/and of the maximal coronary flow? Have the haemodynamic conditions changed between the measurement of the basal and maximal flow? Thus, each method has its ow...|$|R

RESULTS: In both groups, the highest flow velocity and the lowest coronary vascular resistance were observed during the adenosine infusion. Flow velocity values and indices of coronary vasodilator capacity observed after the adenosine bolus and the high-dose dipyridamole infusion were very close to those obtained during the adenosine infusion, especially in Group 1. Coronary flow velocity was lower and coronary vascular resistance higher after low-dose dipyridamole, significantly in Group 2. The maximal flow response to the adenosine bolus was observed within a few seconds after the injection, and was very short. The peak response to the adenosine infusion was observed 57 +/- 27 s after its start. The coronary flow velocity response to dipyridamole was dose dependent and differed between Groups 1 and 2.

40|$|Objectives: Tricuspid valve {{regurgitation}} {{is usually}} secondary and {{results from the}} changes in geometry of tricuspid annulus, dilatation or overload of right atrium and right ventricle. The aim {{of the study was}} the assessment of early and long-term results of tricuspid valve annuloplasty performed in the Department of Cardiac Surgery in Lodz, Poland between 1988 - 2003. Design: The study group consisted of 267 patients with tricuspid valve regurgitation. Tricuspid valve annuloplasty was performed using two methods: De Vega in 70 patients (26. 2 %) and Revuelta in 197 patients (73. 8 %). All patients were referred to tricuspid surgery on the ground of classic echocardiography and in 92 cases <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> was necessary to verify diagnosis. Intraoperative <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> was performed in 162 patients (60, 7 %). Results: Throughout the long-term follow-up rates of patients with good result of tricuspid annuloplasty were: 86 % after 5 years, 45 % after 12 years, and 40 % after 15 years. Since 1997, due to excellent results, tricuspid annuloplasty has been performed using Revuelta procedure only. Within 6 -years follow-up after tricuspid annuloplasty a necessity of reoperation was observed in 19 patients (7. 1 %) from a subgroup without intraoperative <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> and in only 2 (0. 75 %) from a subgroup with <b>transoesophageal</b> <b>echocardiography</b> monitoring.

However, its diagnostic value has not been tested in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. METHODS: Transmitral inflow patterns were studied by <b>transoesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography</b> in 43 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass after opening of the sternum (baseline) and during grafting of the left anterior descending artery. Peak early (E) and peak late (A) transmitral velocities and their ratio (E/A) were recorded. Myocardial ischaemia was defined by standard criteria using two-dimensional echocardiography and seven-lead electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (64 +/- 8 yr, 9 women) fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria for analysis. During distal revascularization, 16 patients showed myocardial ischaemia and 15 did not. The use of vasoactive drugs, haemodynamic findings and transmitral inflow patterns were similar in both groups at baseline and during grafting. In the ischaemic group, E was 67. 1 +/- 13. 9 cm s- 1 at baseline and 69. 5 +/- 23. 2 cm s- 1 during grafting, and the E/A ratios were 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 and 1. 4 +/- 0. 9, respectively.

DESIGN: A prospective study investigating the significance of aortic valve area, pressure gradient across the aortic valve, systolic left ventricular wall stress index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index in the coronary flow velocity profile of aortic stenosis; and comparing flow velocity profiles between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis using <b>transoesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography</b> to obtain coronary artery flow velocities of the left anterior descending coronary artery. SETTING: Tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENTS: Fifty eight patients with aortic stenosis and 15 controls with normal coronary arteries. RESULTS: Adequate recordings of the profile of coronary artery flow velocities were obtained in 46 patients (79 %). Left ventricular wall stress was the only significant haemodynamic variable for determining peak systolic velocity (r = - 0. 83, F = 88. 5, P < 0. 001). The pressure gradient across the aortic valve was the only contributor for explaining peak diastolic velocity (r = 0. 56, F = 20. 9, P < 0. 001). Controls and asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (n = 12) did not differ for peak systolic velocity [32. 8 (SEM 9. 7) v 27. 0 (8. 7) cm/s, NS] and peak diastolic velocity [58. 3 (18. 7) v 61. 9 (13. 5) cm/s, NS]. In contrast, patients with angina (n = 12) or syncope (n = 8) had lower peak systolic velocities and higher peak diastolic velocities than asymptomatic patients (P < 0. 01). Peak systolic and diastolic velocities were - 7. 7 (22. 5) cm/s and 81. 7 (17. 6) cm/s for patients with angina, and - 19. 5 (22. 3) cm/s and 94. 0 (20. 9) cm/s for patients with syncope. Asymptomatic patients and patients with dyspnoea (n = 14) did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Increased pressure gradient across the aortic valve and enhanced systolic wall stress result in characteristic changes of the profile of coronary flow velocities in patients with aortic stenosis. Decreased or reversed systolic flow velocities are compensated by enhanced diastolic flow velocities, particularly in patients with angina and syncope. This characteristic pattern of the profile of coronary artery flow velocities in patients with angina or syncope may be useful for differentiating those patients from asymptomatic patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of equipotent {{isoflurane}} and halothane anaesthesia. Six adult horses were investigated on two separate occasions at least 4 weeks apart. On both occasions anaesthesia was induced by ketamine 2. 2 mg/kg bwt given 5 min after i. v. administration 100 microg/kg bwt romifidine. Anaesthesia was maintained either by halothane or isoflurane (end-tidal concentrations 0. 9 - 1. 0 % and 1. 3 - 1. 4 %, respectively). Horses were ventilated by intermittent positive pressure to maintain PaCO 2 between 40 - 50 mmHg. Haemodynamic variables were measured using catheter-mounted strain gauge transducers in the left and right ventricle, aorta, and right atrium. Cardiac output (CO), velocity time integral (VTI), maximal aortic blood flow velocity (Vmax) and acceleration (dv/dt(max)), left ventricular pre-ejection period (PEP) and ejection time (ET) were measured from aortic blood flow velocity waveforms obtained by <b>transoesophageal</b> Doppler <b>echocardiography.</b> Flow velocity waveforms were recorded from the femoral arteries and veins using low pulse repetition frequency Doppler ultrasound. Time-averaged mean velocity (TAV), velocity of component a (TaVa), velocity of component b (TaVb) and early diastolic deceleration slope (EDDS) were measured. Pulsatility index (PI) and volumetric flow were calculated. Microvascular blood flow was measured in the left and right semimembranosus muscles by laser Doppler flowmetry. Maximal rate of rise of LV pressure (LVdp/dt(max)), CO, Vmax, dv/dt(max), ET, VTI were significantly higher at all time points during isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane anaesthesia. Pre-ejection period and diastolic aortic blood pressure were significantly less throughout isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane. Isoflurane anaesthesia was associated with significantly lower systemic vascular resistance than halothane anaesthesia. Femoral arterial and venous blood flow were significantly higher and EDDS and PI were significantly lower during isoflurane anaesthesia compared to halothane anaesthesia. In addition during both halothane and isoflurane anaesthesia, femoral arterial flow was higher and EDDS and PI lower in the left (dependent) artery compared to the right (nondependent) artery. This study supports previous work demonstrating improved left ventricular systolic function during isoflurane compared to halothane anaesthesia. This improvement was still evident after premedication with a potent-long acting alpha 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, romifidine, and induction of anaesthesia with ketamine. There was also evidence of increased hindlimb blood flow during isoflurane anaesthesia. However, there were differences observed in flow between the left and right hindlimb during maintenance of anaesthesia with each agent, suggesting that there were differences in regional perfusion in anaesthetised horses caused by factors unrelated to agents administeredPeer reviewe...|$|R
