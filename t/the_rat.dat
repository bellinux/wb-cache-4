5|$|Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is {{standardized}} by the NFRS as an {{equilateral triangle}} of white {{with a side}} that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length.

5|$|Rat Mups bind {{different}} small chemicals. 1-Chlorodecane is {{the most}} common ligand, with 2-methyl-N-phenyl-2-propenamide, hexadecane and 2,6,11-trimethyl decane found to be less prominent. Rat Mups also bind limonene-1,2-epoxide, resulting in a disease of the host's kidney, hyaline-droplet nephropathy, that progresses to cancer. Other species do not develop this disorder because their Mups do not bind that particular chemical. Accordingly, when transgenic mice were engineered to express <b>the</b> <b>rat</b> Mup their kidneys developed the disease.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like <b>the</b> <b>Rat</b> tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
50|$|On {{beginning}} {{his career as}} a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester, Robert Ader focused his research on behavioral conditioning and emotional responsiveness in rats. In 1974, he and a fellow researcher Nicholas Cohen were studying taste aversion in <b>rats.</b> <b>The</b> researchers gave <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> water sweetened with saccharin followed by an injection of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant which caused nausea. Through classical conditioning, <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> learned to avoid water that contained saccharin. When Ader and Cohen began to force feed <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> <b>the</b> saccharin solution, they noticed that <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> began to die. They also found that the rate of death was directly related to how much saccharin solution <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> consumed.|$|R

5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} <b>the</b> <b>rat</b> population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E

5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in <b>the</b> <b>rat,</b> but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E

40|$|Circumferential choledochoplasties with {{vascular}} grafts {{have rarely}} been attempted either experimentally or in clinical practice. In this study, choledochoplasties using autologous venous and arterial grafts were performed in rats.

The operative mortality in treatment groups B, C, D, and E, was 0, and 13 % in group A.

5|$|Footdrumming is used widely as a {{predator}} warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns {{in a number}} of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that <b>the</b> <b>rat</b> is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat. Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} investigating the hepatotoxic effect of mercury chloride and effects of zingiber officinale on this hepatotoxicity. These were carried out via estimation of liver function tests. Fifteen adult wistar rats {{were used for the}} experimental investigations.

Group 2 consists of rats administered with mercuric chloride (5 mg/kg body weight) through intraperitoneal injection. Group three consists of rats administered with mercuric chloride (5 mg/ kg body weight) through intraperitoneal injection and fed with diet supplemented with ginger. The experimental period lasted for twenty days. <b>The</b> <b>rats</b> were sacrificed on the twentieth day after being starved for twelve hours. The blood samples collected by cardiac puncture and placed in appropriately labeled bottles for the various assays. The data obtained was analyzed using the students' t-test distribution. Means of the data was obtained and recorded as mean + standard deviation. There was an increase in the weight of <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> in <b>the</b> control group. There was a decrease in the mean weight of <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> treated with mercury only while in <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> treated with mercury and ginger, there was an increase in the mean weight. The bilirubin level of <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> treated with mercury is significantly higher (P 0. 05) between <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> in <b>the</b> control group and <b>the</b> <b>rats</b> treated with mercury and ginger.
