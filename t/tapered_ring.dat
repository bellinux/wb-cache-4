5000|$|The first Vermilion Lighthouse was {{a wooden}} {{structure}} {{that was built}} in 1847 by a $3,000 grant from the Congress of the United States. In 1859 the lighthouse received a $5000 renovation that rebuilt the structure and added a whale oil lamp and 6th order Fresnel lens. In 1866 Congress appropriated funds to build a new, permanent lighthouse made from iron. Cast in Buffalo, New York in three tapering octagonal sections, the iron used for the lighthouse was recycled from smooth-bored Columbian cannons that had been rendered obsolete after the Battle of Fort Sumter in the American Civil War. As Vermilion native Ernest Wakefield wrote, “The iron, therefore, of the 1877 Vermilion lighthouse echoed and resonated with the terrible trauma of the War Between the States.” [...] The ironworkers used sand molds of three <b>tapering</b> <b>rings,</b> octahedral in shape.|$|R

Results show that damping in <b>tapered</b> <b>ring</b> seals (optimized for stiffness) is less than that in straight bore ring seals for the same minimum clearance. Damping in ring seals can promote fractional frequency whirl and can, thus, be detrimental. Thus, tapered seals can benefit rotor and seal stability by having lower damping as well as higher stiffness. Use of incompressible results leads to large errors...|$|E

50|$|Adult tabanids {{are large}} flies with {{prominent}} compound eyes, short antennae composed of three segments, and wide bodies. In females, {{the eyes are}} widely separated but in males they are almost touching; they are often patterned and brightly coloured in life but appear dull in preserved specimens. The terminal segment of the antennae is pointed and is annulated, appearing to {{be made up of}} several <b>tapering</b> <b>rings.</b> There are no hairs or arista arising from the antennae. Both head and thorax are clad in short hairs but there are no bristles on the body. The membranous forewings are clear, uniformly shaded grey or brown, or patterned in some species; they have a basal lobe (or calypter) that covers the modified knob-like hindwings or halteres. The tips of the legs have two lobes on the sides (pulvilli) and a central lobe or empodium in addition to two claws that enable them to grip surfaces. Species recognition is based on details of head structures (antennae, frons, and maxillae), the wing venation and the body patterning; minute variations of surface structure cause subtle alterations of the overlying hairs which alters the appearance of the body.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A compact {{multiple}} band-notch {{ultra-wide band}} (UWB) band-pass filter (BPF) with {{surface area of}} 18 × 12 mm 2 is introduced in this article. The proposed filter {{is a combination of}} novel symmetrically <b>tapered</b> elliptic <b>rings</b> (STER) and contiguous split ring resonators (SRR), with stepped impedance resonator (SIR) structure to realize the multi-band notch UWB pass band characteristics. In the proposed structure, band-notches are generated for interfering microwave bands such as, WiMAX, WLAN and X-band applications. These notches are achieved by optimizing structural parameters of SRR sections. The proposed filter is fabricated on RT/Duroid 5880 substrate with εr = 2. 2 and thickness of 0. 787 mm.

40|$|A {{very well}} exposed {{sandstone}} dyke swarm {{in the basement}} of Bornholm (Vang and Hammer granite) has been discovered recently north of Vang. It strikes 120 " to 125 " on average. Individual dykes are up to 23 cm thick. The fillings consist of pale, greyish to brownish, fine-grained to medium-grained quartz sandstone. It has a grain-supported structure, and the porespace is filled with argillaceous-limonitic material and carbonate (dolomite) cement. The opening and filling of the fissures were caused by normal extension movements in NNE-SSW direc-tion in several steps, probably during the earIy Cambrian. The overlying Balka sands were implosively sucked down into the fissure vacuums caused by the sudden opening.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, ring {{compression}} test {{was conducted to}} investigate i) effects of surface topography on friction and lubrication at room temperature with both dry and lubricated conditions, and ii) the effect of die temperature on friction and lubrication by differentiating temperatures of die and ring samples. Findings from experiments and FE results lead to develop a pressure-dependent variable friction model that concurrently changes friction factor during the forming stroke and different contact surface areas. The constant frictional model and this variable friction model were used in FE simulations of {{ring compression}}. The prediction results were compared with experimental results in details. The use of variable friction model gave very good correlations of the final ring geometry than other constant friction models in comparison to experiments. This implies that the pressure-dependent variable friction model can better characterize the interfacial friction condition in cold forging applications. In the ring compression with heated dies, the temperature rise was found to degrade the performance of lubricant, {{which resulted in the}} <b>tapered</b> shape <b>ring.</b> Therefore, the effect of surface topography and die temperature on interfacial friction condition with lubricant viscosity should be considered for the improved friction model for FE simulations of forging processes with high stroking rates...|$|R

30|$|To {{quantify}} {{wood production}} along the vertical gradient, we computed wood volume increment for main trunks of climbed trees in each plot. Above TB, we used linear interpolation to compute ring widths at measurement heights between core samples. Below BH, we calculated ring width {{as the average}} of ring width at BH and the ring-width:wood radius ratio at BH multiplied by wood radius at lower height. This procedure accounted for wood investment in buttress formation while maintaining a consistent rate of taper change (Sillett et al. 2015). To visualize vertical growth patterns, we converted ring widths to cross-sectional areas at each height by sequentially subtracting wood cross-sections (e.g., 2014 cross-section subtracted from 2015 cross-section yielded 2015 ring area). Across all measurement heights for each tree, we regressed ring area against wood radius and computed the coefficient of determination (R 2) for each year. These ring-area versus radius correlations tended to be positive and strong (R 2 > 0.9) most years {{as a consequence of}} geometry, but when disruptions in <b>ring</b> <b>taper</b> (e.g., missing or abnormally large rings) occurred for whatever reason, R 2 values dropped precipitously. We identified anomalous years in ring-area versus radius correlation time series (hereafter, taper anomalies) by expressing each year as the difference between preceding and subsequent 5 -year means, and then standardizing values by standard deviates across the full time series for each tree.|$|R

Five standard shapes of the axis symmetric specimens of cylindrical with aspect ratios 1. 0 and 1. 5, <b>ring,</b> <b>tapered</b> and flanged were selected for the present investigation. Specimens were deformed in compression between two flat platens to predict the metal flow at room temperature. The longitudinal and oblique cracks were obtained as the two major modes of surface fractures. Cylindrical and ring specimen shows the oblique surface crack while the tapered and flanged shows the longitudinal crack. Machine Vision system using PC based video recording with a CCD camera was used to analyze the deformation of 4 X 4 mm square grid marked at mid plane of the specimen. The strain paths obtained from different specimens exhibited nonlinearity from the beginning {{to the end of the}} strain path. The circumferential stress component θσ increasingly becomes tensile with continued deformation. On the other hand the axial stress zσ, increased in the very initial stages of deformation but started becoming less compressive immediately as barreling develops. The nature of hydrostatic stress on the rim of the flanged specimen was found to be tensile. Finite element software ANSYS has been applied for the analysis of the upset forming process.

50|$|The tercentenary of Champlain's {{explorations of}} the lake {{provided}} the occasion for celebrations marking the event, and commissions from New York and Vermont, {{put in charge of}} the festivities, decided to erect a monument. A suggestion in a newspaper prompted the notion to convert an existing lighthouse, and after some consideration of other sites, the Crown Point Light was chosen. The stone sheath of the tower was stripped away, leaving the brick spiral staircase sitting on the foundation. A new tower was constructed on and around this, consisting of a short <b>tapered</b> base, a <b>ring</b> of eight Doric columns, an elaborately carved cornice and parapet, and a new lantern atop the whole. On the side facing the lake, a projection from the base supported a monumental bronze designed by Carl Augustus Heber and cast at the Roman Bronze Works consisting of Champlain accompanied by one fellow Frenchman and one Huron native. The French government sent a plaque by Auguste Rodin which was later placed below the other sculpture. A broad staircase led down to a pier projecting into the lake. A fifth order Fresnel lens continued to shine in the lantern giving a fixed white light, and the old keeper's house remained in place, attached to the new tower by a short passageway. The memorial was dedicated on July 5, 1912 at a ceremony presided over by Governors John Abner Mead of Vermont and John Adams Dix of New York.|$|R
