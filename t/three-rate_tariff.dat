40|$|The {{electricity}} industry {{throughout the}} world, {{which has long}} been dominated by vertically integrated utilities, has experienced major changes. Deregulation, unbundling, wholesale and retail wheeling, and real-time pricing were abstract concepts a few years ago. Today market forces drive the price of electricity and reduce the net cost through increased competition. As power markets continue to evolve, {{there is a growing}} need for advanced modeling approaches. This article addresses the challenge of maximizing the profit (or return) of power producers through the optimization of their share of customers. Power producers have fixed production marginal costs and decide the quantity of energy to sell in both day-ahead markets and a set of target clients, by negotiating bilateral contracts involving a <b>three-rate</b> <b>tariff.</b> Producers sell energy by considering the prices of a reference week and five different types of clients with specific load profiles. They analyze several tariffs and determine the best share of customers, i. e., the share that maximizes profit. © 2014 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{markets are}} systems for effecting the {{purchase}} {{and sale of}} electricity using supply and demand to set energy prices. Two major market models are often distinguished: pools and bilateral contracts. Pool prices tend to change quickly and variations are usually highly unpredictable. In this way, market participants often enter into bilateral contracts to hedge against pool price volatility. This article addresses the challenge of optimizing the portfolio of clients managed by trader agents. Typically, traders buy energy in day-ahead markets and sell it {{to a set of}} target clients, by negotiating bilateral contracts involving <b>three-rate</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Traders sell energy by considering the prices of a reference week and five different types of clients. They analyze several tariffs and determine the best share of customers, i. e., the share that maximizes profit. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
