5|$|<b>The</b> <b>seeming</b> {{failure of}} the RAAF and RAN to {{cooperate}} to finish off a damaged submarine led Royle to order an inquiry into the attack. This found that a breakdown in communication between the two services was {{the main cause of}} the failure, with both the aircraft and the naval signal room in Sydney making procedural errors. Rear Admiral Gerard Muirhead-Gould, the naval officer in command of the Sydney region, also noted that communications between the RAN and RAAF were unsatisfactory at higher levels, and that the communication procedures to be used in anti-submarine operations were not well known or understood. In response, he suggested that the RAN establish the position of Commander Escort Vessels Group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> limitations, {{he still}} tried {{his best to}} {{contribute}} to help Alaska win. He averaged about 20 mins of playing time with 9.2 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists; worse than his numbers last season.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, in <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> <b>The</b> Tide {{has taken}} over many major {{departments}} of <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> and even Seemsberia. To rescue <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> Freck reveals he is a double agent for <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> and gets <b>the</b> help of the Glitches {{in exchange for a}} place to live. The Glitches succeed in destroying The Tide and recapture <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> but <b>the</b> Unthinkable is about to occur. All the extra Thought was used during the siege to <b>The</b> <b>Seems.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Glitch in Sleep {{takes place}} in two worlds, <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> and <b>The</b> World. <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> is another world which {{is in charge of}} {{providing}} our World (The World) with everything it might need, from Sleep to Sunset. In <b>the</b> <b>Seems,</b> there are Departments that control various needs of our World such as Time and Nature. Whenever something goes wrong in <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> an elite team of professionals are sent in to Fix the problem. The team is made up of one Fixer and one Briefer. A Briefer is equal to the assistant of the Fixer. If the problems of <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> are not fixed, The World would be affected depending on how the severe the problem is in <b>the</b> <b>Seems.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Split Second is {{the second}} novel in <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> series. It was {{published}} by Bloomsbury Publishing and written by John Hulme and Michael Wexler. It follows Becker Drane, a Fixer for <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> on a Mission to retrieve a Second. A Second is a mineral in <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> which provides Time for our World. <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> is a parallel universe in charge of providing our World with what it needs to keep on going.|$|R
25|$|A {{clock on}} an {{electronic}} board ticked faster than its expected 10MHz frequency, lengthening the reported flight-time of neutrinos, thereby somewhat reducing <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> faster-than-light effect. OPERA stated the component had been operating outside its specifications.|$|E
25|$|Belizeans protested {{for most}} of 2005 over the {{conditions}} of the country and <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> ignorance of the ruling People's United Party toward these conditions. Toward the end of 2005 the PUP and the Opposition UDP turned their attention to preparing for the municipal elections in 2006.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> {{threat of}} global {{terrorism}} started to increase {{after the incident}} of 11 September in United States, followed up by several series of bombings in Bali and Jakarta, Indonesia and in Malaysia, the RMP has formed 2 anti-terrorism corps. These two elite forces are known as Pasukan Gerakan Khas (PGK) and Unit Gempur Marin (UNGERIN).|$|E
50|$|The Glitch in Sleep is {{the first}} novel in <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> {{children}} series, released as a hardcover on September 18, 2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing. It was written by John Hulme and Michael Wexler.

50|$|The Glitch of Sleep is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} in the book. The glitch survived the Clean Sweep Mission when <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> destroyed every Glitch they could find. In the end, the glitch is found and shipped to Seemsberia, the prison in <b>The</b> <b>Seems.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{women who}} use cocaine while {{pregnant}} use other drugs too; {{one study found}} that 93% of those who use cocaine or opiates also use tobacco, marijuana, or alcohol. When researchers control for use of other drugs, many of <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> effects of cocaine on head size, birth weight, Apgar scores, and prematurity disappear.|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} years saw <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> {{recovery}} of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848–1849. Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie Prussian scheming {{to create a new}} German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the Emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> success, {{however, the}} Gimlet was already {{becoming}} obsolete; guided missiles were now {{considered to be}} the wave of the future. Production of Gimlet was cancelled in early 1957, after production of 15,000 rockets; that October, the T-Gimlet version was cancelled as well. Although the missile age meant that Gimlet did not enter operational service, the production processes developed for the rocket would be modified and used in the production of the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} book, Becker is {{found guilty of}} {{breaking}} the Golden Rule by meeting with Jennifer Kaley {{at the end of}} The Split Second. Because of this, he is suspended from duty for a year, and his memories of Jennifer are [...] "unremembered". Jennifer is also unremembered of everything about <b>The</b> <b>Seems.</b> However, before they are both unremembered, a train of Thought goes missing and Becker is called in with three other Fixers to find it. The train is found, and Becker must drive it back. However, all the extra Thought that <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> had was spent already. To get The World the Thought it needs, Becker drives through to the Inbetweener. He succeeds in getting the Thought back, but he crashes into the dangerously low entrance and may not have survived. Jennifer receives a job in <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> but at Becker's request, she is still unremembered about Becker and <b>The</b> <b>Seems.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Lost Train of Thought is {{the third}} novel in <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> series and was {{released}} on October 1, 2009 by Bloomsbury Publishing. It was written by John Hulme and Michael Wexler. It follows Becker Drane, a Fixer for <b>The</b> <b>Seems</b> on his last Mission as a Fixer to retrieve a train filled with Thought that went missing. Raw Thought is imported into The World {{to allow us to}} think for ourselves.|$|R
25|$|Through {{the fall}} and winter, both armies {{constructed}} elaborate series of trenches, eventually spanning more than 30 miles (50km), as the Union Army attempted {{to get around the}} right (western) flank of the Confederates and destroy their supply lines. Although the Northern public became quite dispirited by <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> lack of progress at Petersburg, the dramatic success of Sherman at Atlanta helped ensure the reelection of Abraham Lincoln, which guaranteed that the war would be fought to a conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{attribute}} <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> lack {{of female}} interest in video games {{to the negative}} portrayal of women in video games and to misogynistic attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers. A 2012 Twitter discussion among women working in games, collated under the hashtag #1reasonwhy, argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay {{for men and women}} were common in the games industry.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Ohio State came to Michigan Stadium with an 11–0 record (7–0 Big Ten) {{and ranked}} #3 in the BCS standings. Michigan was a disappointing 7–4 (3–4 Big Ten). In spite of <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> mismatch, the game {{remained}} close and with 32 seconds remaining Michigan scored {{to bring the}} score to 42–41. Michigan attempted a two-point conversion for the lead, but Devin Gardner's pass was intercepted {{in the end zone}} by Tyvis Powell, and Ohio State escaped with the win.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>seeming</b> {{rarity of}} a $2 bill can be {{attributed}} to its low printing numbers as a Federal Reserve Note. Hoarding of the series due to lack of public knowledge of the $2 bill has resulted in very few bills seen in circulation. After its initial release, supplies of the Series 1976 $2 bill were allowed to dwindle until August 1996 when a new series dated 1995 began to be printed. This series was only printed for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{a number}} of LDS women became active and vocal proponents of women's rights. Of {{particular}} note was the LDS journalist and suffragist Emmeline Blanch Wells, editor of the Woman's Exponent, a Utah feminist newspaper. Wells, who was both a feminist and a polygamist, wrote vocally {{in favor of a}} woman's role in the political process and public discourse. National suffrage leaders, however, were somewhat perplexed by <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> paradox between Utah's progressive stand on women's rights, and the church's stand on polygamy.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{summer was}} one of some turmoil for Everton as their failure to gain Government acceptance for their proposed stadium move to Kirkby, the departure of Chief Executive Keith Wyness and <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> reluctance of David Moyes to sign a new contract increased the gloom amongst supporters. In {{the last week of}} the transfer window, the club transfer record was broken with the signing of Marouane Fellaini for £15 million from Standard Liège. Everton failed to qualify for the UEFA Cup group stages, as they were eliminated by Liège, with Fellaini ineligible to play against his former team.|$|E

50|$|In the beginning, the Village of Covas, Minho, Portugal is {{experiencing}} a severe drought. In reality however, a Rain Tower where water is stored in <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> another world that controls our World, had been blocked by the Tide. Anytime a problem occurs in <b>The</b> <b>Seems,</b> a special team is called in consisting of one Briefer and one Fixer. They are both highly trained professionals at Fixing any problems. To get the Rain back, Fixer Cassiopeia (Casey) Lake and Briefer Becker Drane are called in. For his exceptional Fix, Briefer Drane is promoted to Fixer #37.|$|R
25|$|The Forum did not, however, list this {{information}} for Afghanistan, Iraq, or Tunisia. It {{is probable that}} the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One possible explanation for <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for every woman {{between the ages of}} 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{deployed}} U-boats (submarines) {{after the}} war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the Kaiserliche Marine employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> invulnerability of U-boats {{led to the development}} of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (HMS R-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} factor, which explained <b>the</b> <b>seeming</b> {{ease with}} which a British aristocrat could dispose of his ancestral seat, was the aristocratic habit of only marrying within the aristocracy and whenever possible to a sole heiress. This meant that by the 20th century, many owners of country houses often owned several country mansions. Thus it became a favoured option to select the most conveniently sited (whether for privacy or sporting reasons), easily managed, or of greatest sentimental value; fill it with the choicest art works from the other properties; and then demolish the less favoured. Thus, one solution not only solved any financial problems, but also removed an unwanted burden.|$|E
