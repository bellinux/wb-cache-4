At these annual meetings, they touched on {{administrative}} and pastoral issues, including <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>songs</b> into Indonesian languages. In 1959 Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from Pope JohnXXIII dated 20March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six ecclesiastical provinces: two in Java, one in Sumatra, one in Flores, one in Sulawesi and Maluku, and one in Borneo. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its archbishop. He was elevated on 3January 1961.|$|E

40|$|The area of {{audiovisual}} translation indisputably awakens {{a growing}} interest amongst scholars. However, {{the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>songs</b> in an audiovisual context (AVC) has not been thoroughly explored. The purpose {{of this research is}} to offer a descriptive analysis on the area of translating songs (from English into Spanish) in an AVC. In particular, the research focuses on the translation of the songs included in nine animated Disney films from the Disney Renaissance Period (1989 - 1999). The study assesses how non-linguistic elements such as rhyme, rhythm, images or lip synchrony affect the task of translating songs by observing specific practical examples. Both subtitling and dubbing are analysed as translation practices. The different constraints involving each form of translation are assessed. Furthermore, the thesis offers a descriptive analysis of strategies used in <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>songs</b> in AVCs. This study highlights the importance of assessing the impact of non-linguistic elements in future studies on the translation of vocal music in AVCs and aims to provide a model for the contrastive analysis of song lyrics between the ST and the TT...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this Research Innovation project is to {{contribute}} to {{new developments in the}} interlingual and intralingual translation of texts comprising musical elements. The core research questions of this project are the following: (1) First, the project aims to investigate how music can be made available across sensory barriers, in which cases it should be mediated and what routines could be heralded as best translation practice in these instances. This project aims to find out the type of translation provision that will work in musical contexts and hopes to build upon the little research that already exists on the translation of music, both for sighted and hearing audiences, as well as for visually and hearing-impaired. (2) The second research question explores the relationship of musical texts and new technologies, considering how the latter are crucial for enhancing the mediation of musical texts and inspiring new ways of translating music. he third overarching research question of this project seeks the improvement of knowledge and techniques of how vocal music is best translated. What are the trends in the translation of musical texts? How can the training of translators with limited expertise in music be enhanced? In what circumstances should musical input be transferred or left out? What are the reasons for the current inconsistency of translation provision in texts involving music? In what circumstances and to what degree might it be appropriate to suggest the impact that music has on a text? How much do new trends in copyright legislation affect the provision of <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>songs?</b> These are some of the questions that researchers aim to find answers for...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>song</b> lyrics, like poetry, has typical challenges. It is firstly {{because of}} the limited but {{meaningful}} and beautiful words employed by the song writer in conveying message and expressing his/her feeling. The choice of media in which <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>song</b> lyrics will be used is another challenge because different media need different translation strategies indeed. Thus, {{it can be said}} that translating song lyrics for film subtitle might be more adaptable in terms of its rhyme and musical devices that to other purposes or media. The main purpose of making subtitles for films is to help the target audience get the message of the film, through every scene, dialogue, and information from frame to frame, by providing them with the language they understand. By considering some identical characteristics between poetry and song, this study aims to analyze students‘ strategies in translating children <b>songs,</b> the soundtracks <b>of</b> Indonesian movie ―Ambilkan Bulan‖, for English subtitle. As a part <b>of</b> literary <b>translation,</b> this study will be focusing on the way student subtitlers reproduce form, rhythm, rhyme, and the tone for the subtitling in comparison with its source text and by taking into account the target audience of the movie, i. e. children.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{subtitle}} and analyze the subtitles of the animation movie directed by the Tomm Moore, <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> the Sea. It deals with the adventures of Saoirse, {{the last of the}} selkies, the mythological women who turned into seals, and his brother Ben to save the fairies and send them home. Although Italy is a “dubbing country”, I decided to subtitle the film not to affect the original audio track, as the Irish accent and Celtic melodies are a fundamental element in <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> the Sea. I chose this movie because it is a quality product (nominated in 2015 for "The Best Animation Movie”) which deserves to be commercialized outside film festivals. In a second phase, I analyzed my subtitles and compared them to amateur subtitles, created by the SRT Project group, to understand the strategies adopted and the basic differences between the two types of subtitling. My dissertation consists of three chapters. The first provides a general overview <b>of</b> audiovisual <b>translation</b> and language transfer methods, focusing on subtitling. The second chapter introduces the movie in an Irish context, and then analyzes the subtitling process, from the software used, to <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> strategies adopted. Finally, the third chapter describes the phenomenon of amateur subtitling, and the most important Italian communities of the current years. Moreover, I analyzed SRT Project fan translation, and asked them a set of questions about amateur subtitling and <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Song</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, in order to understand this world and the fansubbing process.

40|$|One of {{the chief}} {{functions}} of birdsong is to attract and stimulate females. In canaries (Serinus canaria), speciﬁc phrases (“A” phrases) sung by males have been identiﬁed as especially attractive for females. These phrases unite a number of characteristics that are particularly difﬁcult to combine, including large frequency bandwidth, high repetition rate and multiple-note syllables. Females exposed to “A” phrases produce more copulation displays and deposit more testosterone into their eggs. However, the neuroendocrine pathway underlying <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>song</b> audition to changes in testosterone deposition in yolks is not understood. Increased expression of several immediate early genes including c-fos and zenk (also called egr- 1 in mammals) in other songbird species has been observed in the auditory forebrain of females hearing attractive song, and such differential activation may represent a ﬁrst step in signal processing linking auditory input to egg testosterone deposition. Female canaries in breeding condition were exposed to 60 minutes <b>of</b> “sexy” <b>song</b> with a preponderance of “A” phrases, “non-sexy” song lacking “A” phrases, or white noise. Thirty minutes after the end <b>of</b> <b>song</b> playback, brains were collected, ﬁxed in acrolein and sectioned and stained by immunohistochemistry for quantiﬁcation of the Fos protein, an indicator of neuronal activity, in several regions involved in audition and auditory processing. The endocrine condition of each female was determined by measuring ovarian and oviduct weight {{at the time of}} autopsy. In the caudomedial mesopallium (CMM), Fos expression was higher in females that had heard sexy song than those that heard non-sexy song or white noise. Expression of Fos in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), the nucleus spiriformis medialis (SPM), the nucleus ovoidalis (OV), and the song nucleus HVC was unaffected by song quality. Thus differential auditory processing in the CMM may be an initial stage in the assessment by a female <b>of</b> <b>song</b> information to differential testosterone deposition in the egg...|$|R
