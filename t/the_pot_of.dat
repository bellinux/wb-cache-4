5|$|In 1983, Dan O'Grady {{returns to}} his home in North Dakota from a trip to his native Ireland, where he stole <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> gold from a leprechaun. After burying the gold, O'Grady discovers that the evil leprechaun has {{followed}} him home and murdered his wife. O'Grady uses a four-leaf clover to suppress the leprechaun's powers and trap it inside a crate. Before he can burn it, he suffers a stroke.|$|E
25|$|In Boccaccio's Decameron a memorably morbid tale (novella V) {{tells of}} Lisabetta, whose {{brothers}} slay her lover. He appears {{to her in}} a dream and shows her where he is buried. She secretly disinters the head, and sets it in a pot of basil, which she waters with her daily tears. Shortly after the pot is taken from her by her brothers, she dies of grief. Boccaccio's tale is the source of John Keats' poem Isabella or <b>The</b> <b>Pot</b> <b>of</b> Basil – which in turn inspired the paintings Isabella (Millais painting) and Isabella and <b>the</b> <b>Pot</b> <b>of</b> Basil. A similar story is told of the Longobard queen, Rosalind.|$|E

25|$|The two slabs erected {{on either}} side of the foot of the flight of steps leading to a {{building}} are known as guard stones (Muragal). They are usually carved, although plain guard stones have also been found. Among the Hindu symbols represented on these stones, the most common, apart from <b>the</b> <b>Pot</b> <b>of</b> Abundance and Kalpavrksa, is the figure of the Nagaraja, or anthropomorphic King Cobra. The best example of these, and one of the finest guardstones yet discovered, was found at the Ratnaprasada in Abhayagiriya, and illustrates the degree of perfection reached by the sculptors of Abhayagiri. Lotuses and punkalas are indicative of plenty. Representations of the lotus are of particular significance in agricultural societies where they symbolize the daughters of the guardian deity of rain. The elephant figure at the Eth Pokuna is also a symbol of water.|$|E

500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling water {{for as long as it}} takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

Large amounts (15–50kg) are then transported back to the camp in baskets for further processing. At camp the palm fiber is dipped handful by handful into a pot full of water and wrung out by hand to extract all the starch. [...] <b>The</b> <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> water containing the starch is then used to boil meat or insect larva. This mixture will be eaten hot (as a thick gravy broth) or allowed to cool overnight, which hardens it into a pudding.|$|E

[...] During college, Porter became acquainted with New York City's vibrant nightlife, taking the train to New York City to enjoy dinner, theater, and {{a night on the}} town with his classmates, before returning to New Haven, Connecticut, early in the morning. He also wrote musical comedy scores for his fraternity, the Yale Dramat (the Yale dramatic society), and as a student at Harvard – Cora (1911), And the Villain Still Pursued Her (1912), <b>The</b> <b>Pot</b> <b>of</b> Gold (1912), The Kaleidoscope (1913) and Paranoia (1914) – which helped prepare him for a career as a Broadway and Hollywood composer and lyricist. [...] After graduating from Yale, Porter enrolled in Harvard Law School in 1913. He soon felt that he was not destined to be a lawyer, and, at the suggestion of the dean of the law school, Porter switched to Harvard's music faculty, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Pietro Yon. Kate Porter did not object to this move, but it was kept secret from J. O. Cole.|$|E
