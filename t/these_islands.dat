5|$|The Hebridean {{archipelago}} outlier of St Kilda {{is composed}} of Paleogene igneous formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements. <b>These</b> <b>islands</b> represent {{the remnants of a}} long extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40m (130ft) below sea level.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from <b>these</b> <b>islands</b> may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on <b>these</b> <b>islands.</b> Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total tuatara population had become extinct in the past century.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age {{settlers}} also constructed megaliths {{at various}} sites, {{many of them}} dating from the second millennium BC, although the chambered cairns were replaced by burial cists, found on for example, Inchmarnock. Settlement evidence, especially from {{the early part of}} this era is however poor. The Queen of the Inch necklace is an article of jewellery made of jet found on Bute that dates from circa 2000 BC. During the early Iron Age Brythonic culture held sway, there being no evidence that the Roman occupation of southern Scotland extended to <b>these</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1904 six {{specimens}} and an egg {{were collected}} by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to <b>these</b> <b>islands,</b> he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but {{did not find any}} evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.|$|E

50|$|However, World War I had a {{profound}} impact on the “Southern Expansion Doctrine”. Japan was able to occupy the vast areas in the Pacific formerly controlled by the German Empire: i.e. the Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands and Palau. In 1919, <b>these</b> <b>island</b> groups officially became a League of Nations mandate of Japan and came under the administration of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The focus of the “Southern Expansion Doctrine” expanded to include <b>these</b> <b>island</b> groups (the South Pacific Mandate), the economic and military development of which came to be viewed as essential to Japan's security.|$|R

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, England leased <b>these</b> <b>islands</b> to the English East India Company in 1668 for a sum of £10 per annum. The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675. The islands were subsequently attacked by Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, in October 1672, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India on 20 February 1673, and Siddi admiral Sambal on 10 October 1673.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Hebrides {{as a whole}} were {{a strong}} Scottish Gaelic-speaking area, and in 1921 more than 50% of the populations of most of <b>these</b> <b>islands,</b> {{including}} Skye, Mull and Islay, were proficient in the language. However, although the Outer Hebrides have retained many Gaelic speakers, in the 2001 census only Skye (31%) and Tiree (48%) had more than 25% of the resident population able to speak Gaelic; Mull, Jura, Gigha and Coll each recorded figures of less than 15%.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on <b>these</b> <b>islands,</b> it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 {{the three}} main islands off of Kourou's coast, the Salut island group (which {{included}} Devil's Island) also became prisons. <b>These</b> <b>island</b> prisons held mostly political prisoners , {{as well as some}} of France's toughest criminals.

5|$|Mumbai {{is built}} on what was once an {{archipelago}} of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). It is not exactly known when <b>these</b> <b>islands</b> were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age. Perhaps {{at the beginning of}} the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.|$|E
5|$|Of the 718 islands, only 47 are {{inhabited}} in {{the sense}} that at least one person resides on that island. Some sources indicate that Croatia has 67 inhabited islands, which is the number of islands that have a settlement on them, but 20 of <b>these</b> <b>islands</b> have lost all of their permanent population {{as a result of the}} population decline occurring throughout the Croatian islands due to insufficient economic activity.|$|E
5|$|The dogs of all <b>these</b> <b>islands</b> were short, {{and their}} sizes vary {{from that of}} a lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
50|$|Four {{distinct}} subpopulations of {{this species}} {{have been described as}} subspecies, especially with regard to their conservation status. Estimates of <b>these</b> <b>island</b> colonies numbers were between 4,300 and 6,700 in 1994, the environmental conditions cause fluctuations in the total number of animals.|$|R

5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and folds. <b>These</b> <b>islands</b> are Scotland's most northerly area of Caledonian orogenic rocks {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of <b>these</b> <b>islands.</b> The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if {{it could not be}} used for offensive operations.
