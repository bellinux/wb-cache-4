5|$|As work on Nike-X began, {{high-ranking}} {{military and}} civilian officials began to press for Zeus deployment as an interim system {{in spite of the}} known problems. They argued <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be upgraded in-place as the new technologies became available. McNamara was opposed to early deployment, while Congressman Daniel J. Flood would be a prime force for immediate deployment.|$|E

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, {{convection}} {{increased in}} the complex system that absorbed the remnants of Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone at any time. The low continued quickly westward, generating only sporadic convection, and crossed Florida on November 3. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it turned to the west-northwest, and without organizing it made landfall in southeast Louisiana on November 4. It continued inland, and quickly weakened over Louisiana and Mississippi on November 5.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved {{further into}} the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, {{as well as the}} presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{predicted}} the trough of low pressure to drop very heavy rainfall across western Cuba and Florida. The National Weather Service in Miami issued a flood watch for southern Florida, stating that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> produce flooding on roads and in low-lying areas. In general, however, {{there was little}} warning for the flooding in South Florida. While Leslie was moving east-northeastward, it posed a threat to Bermuda, prompting officials to issue a tropical storm watch at 0300UTC on October6. Six hours later, tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. However, the storm passed well to the west, and the warnings were dropped by late on October6.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E

40|$|Part 6 : FORENSIC TOOLSInternational audienceThe {{threat of}} {{insiders}} stealing valuable corporate data continues to escalate. The inadvertent exposure of internal data {{has also become}} a major problem. Data loss prevention systems are designed to monitor and block attempts at exposing sensitive data to the outside world. They have become very popular, {{to the point where}} forensic investigators have to take these systems into account. This chapter describes the first experimental analysis of data loss prevention systems that attempts to ascertain their effectiveness at stopping the unauthorized exposure of sensitive data and the ease with which <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> be circumvented. Four systems are evaluated (three of them in detail). The results point to considerable weaknesses in terms of general effectiveness and the ease with which <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> be disabled...|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa between late August16 and early August17. On August 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the tropical wave as a potential area for development, associated with an area of disorganized convection about 300mi (480km) southwest of Cabo Verde. Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization. Dry and stable air was an initial inhibiting factor in development, with deep convection waning on August20 and August21. However, the convection and circulation had become better defined by August21. By August23, the system had developed an elongated and poorly-defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters, though convention continued to expand. On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds. By this point, the NHC noted that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{despite the}} initial {{positive}} {{response to the}} Geneva experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground Rainier shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), became convinced that the Geneva findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy. In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards the Geneva System. While the Geneva experts believed <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> detect underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an official yield of 13 kilotons). As a result, the Geneva detection regime {{and the number of}} control posts would have to be significantly expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>could</b> not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E
