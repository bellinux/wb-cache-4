5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. The result was the presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> other characters in the novel. For a more detailed account of the differences between magic realism and Carpentier's real maravilloso, see the page on magic realism.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence.|$|E

5|$|The Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu was {{particularly}} favourable to <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Shaiva sect. It {{is said that}} the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This {{is evident from the}} four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by Vikrama Chola (1118–35). The other images are at Darasuram and Kampahareshvarar temple, Thirubuvanam built by a Chola ruler, Kulottunga Chola III where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.|$|E
5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of Islamic law. The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. Succession by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a friction between Taizu's desires and <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} succession process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical move. This friction between primogeniture and succession by the strongest candidate would lead to repeated succession crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|Most Sanskrit {{works were}} commentaries {{either on the}} Vedas or on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, written by well known figures such as Sayana and Vidyaranya that extolled {{the superiority of the}} Advaita {{philosophy}} over other rival Hindu philosophies. Other writers were famous Dvaita saints of the Udupi order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title Tikacharya for his polemicial writings), Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticised <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Adi Sankara. Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudal chiefs. Some {{members of the royal family}} were writers of merit and authored important works such as Jambavati Kalyana by King Krishnadevaraya, and Madura Vijayam by Princess Gangadevi, a daughter-in-law of King Bukka I. Also known as Veerakamparaya Charita, the book dwells on the conquest of the Madurai Sultanate by the Vijayanagara empire.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} statements of <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Reformed churches, followed {{the view that}} Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> {{the general}} public {{about the effect of}} {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood in stark {{contrast}} {{from those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, like those of the Han Chinese upper classes, had arranged marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and dancing in the streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of their beauty, familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood in sharp contrast from <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their husbands and were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|E

5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E
5|$|Elena is a {{professional}} journalist, who first focuses on documentary work, and then moves into news broadcast. In the first video game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Elena follows Drake, filming a documentary on his archaeological findings. Her network has instructed her to film him while he raises the coffin of Sir Francis Drake {{from the bottom of}} the ocean, which he locates from coordinates on a family heirloom ring he wears around his neck. After she and Drake are attacked by pirates (Drake fought them off), he abandons her and leaves with Victor Sullivan to find the lost treasure of El Dorado. Despite Drake's attempts, Elena manages to find him, but when they attempt to fly to another location, they are shot down by anti-aircraft fire. They meet up with Sullivan, who they thought had been killed. After discovering that the statue is cursed, Drake must stop Gabriel Roman from using its power, and save Elena in the process. After doing so, Elena, Drake, and Sullivan drive off into the sunset a boat loaded with several small boxes of treasure In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Elena happens across him in Nepal. Elena now acts as an investigative journalist; she and her cameraman Jeff are attempting to prove that war criminal Lazarevic is alive, contrary to <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> NATO. After Lazarevic executes her cameraman, she manages to escape with Drake. She goes ahead of him to a village in Tibet, where she meets Karl Schäfer, a German who had led a Schutzstaffel expedition to Shambhala. Drake and Elena track Lazaravic to a monastery, where they find the entrance to Shambhala. Once inside, they discover that the monsters Drake has been seeing in the area are guardians of the city. Lazaravic apprehends them, but they escape when the guardians attack. Before he confronts Lazaravic, Drake's former partner Harry Flynn almost kills Elena with a grenade. When Lazaravic is confronted, Drake wounds Lazaravic, and leave the guardians to kill him while Drake makes his escape. When she recuperates, the two return to the village and begin a relationship.|$|E
