5|$|Unlike many of {{the other}} British Orders, <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a {{continuous}} record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> plates this was perhaps due to their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, the banner, helm, {{mantling}} and crest (or coronet or crown) are taken down. <b>The</b> <b>stall</b> plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Dames) throughout history.|$|E

500|$|In fact, some {{theoretical}} models incorporate a hydrodynamical instability in <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock {{known as the}} [...] "Standing Accretion Shock Instability" [...] (SASI). This instability comes about {{as a consequence of}} non-spherical perturbations oscillating <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock thereby deforming it. The SASI is often used in tandem with neutrino theories in computer simulations for re-energizing <b>the</b> <b>stalled</b> shock.|$|R

Also, the Emerson String Quartet, a quartet who also {{contribute}} to the Department of Music perform multiple times a year. In front of <b>the</b> <b>Staller</b> Center, <b>the</b> <b>Staller</b> steps serve as a gathering place throughout the spring for many students wishing to socialize.|$|R
5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage <b>the</b> <b>stall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Knight, helm, mantling, crest (or coronet or crown) and sword are taken down. <b>The</b> <b>stall</b> plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} affixed to the back of <b>the</b> <b>stall,</b> so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. The entryway just outside the doors of the chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record {{of the members of the}} order.|$|E
50|$|The {{auditorium}} {{is split}} {{on two levels}} - <b>The</b> <b>Stalls</b> and <b>The</b> Circle with an overall capacity of 1,066 seats. <b>The</b> <b>Stalls</b> is also split into flat and raked seating areas. The stage is 47 ft wide and 31.6 ft deep, with a 1/28 rake.|$|R
50|$|The open {{cannabis}} trade {{returned to}} Pusher Street after the 2004 raids, but <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> were again torn down by Christiania's residents after the 2016 shooting. The hiatus {{on the open}} cannabis trade was short-lived; by May 2017, <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> on Pusher Street were restored.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stalls</b> for <b>the</b> canons and choir, {{along with}} the {{original}} bishop's throne (now used as <b>the</b> dean's <b>stall)</b> and pulpit canopy, were {{a gift to the}} cathedral from Sir John Langdon Bonython in memory of his wife. Made in Adelaide in 1926, carvings can be seen on the capitals at each end of <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> and also around the upper work in the canopies above.|$|R
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered <b>the</b> <b>stall.</b> The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the Sahar International Airport in Mumbai, India, an obese American {{businessman}} dismissively {{makes his}} way past a paraplegic beggar. Later, while using the airport's toilet, the businessman is pulled out of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> violently by the beggar that he passed earlier. Later, the businessman checks into a Washington, D.C. hotel and sits down on his bed. Soon, blood streams out of his bodily orifices.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reports from}} the test pilot, Gerhard Nitschke, were favourable. The He 111's flight {{performance}} and handling were impressive although it dropped its wing in <b>the</b> <b>stall.</b> As a result, the passenger variants had their wings reduced from 25m (82ft) to 23m (75ft). The military aircraft - V1, V3 and V5 - spanned just 22.6m (74.1ft).|$|E
50|$|A barrier blanket is {{sometimes}} used in Australian Thoroughbred racing. This blanket weighs about 40 kilograms and is {{placed over the}} horse prior to entering <b>the</b> starting <b>stalls.</b> It is then tied {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>stalls</b> after <b>the</b> horse has been loaded and remains in the barrier as the horse jumps. Quite a few horses respond positively to it and are more easily loaded and are calmer in <b>the</b> <b>stalls.</b>|$|R

5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. <b>The</b> <b>stall</b> issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These enamelled plates are affixed to the back of <b>the</b> <b>stall</b> and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} {{process from}} a diffuser rotating stall to a stage stall in a centrifugal compressor with a vaned diffuser was investigated by experimental and numerical analyses. From the velocity measurements, {{it was found}} that <b>the</b> rotating <b>stall</b> existed on <b>the</b> shroud side of the diffuser passage in the off-design flow condition. The numerical results revealed the typical vortical structure of <b>the</b> diffuser <b>stall.</b> <b>The</b> diffuser <b>stall</b> cell was caused by the systematic vortical structure which consisted of the tornado-type vortex, the longitudinal vortex at the shroud/suction surface corner (i. e., leading edge vortex (LEV)), and the vortex in the throat area of the diffuser passages. Furthermore, <b>the</b> stage <b>stall,</b> which rotated within both the impeller and diffuser passages, occurred instead of <b>the</b> diffuser <b>stall</b> as <b>the</b> mass flow rate was decreased. According to the velocity measurements at the diffuser inlet, <b>the</b> diffuser <b>stall</b> which rotated on the shroud side was shifted to the hub side. Then, <b>the</b> diffuser <b>stall</b> moved into <b>the</b> impeller passages and formed <b>the</b> stage <b>stall.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> stage <b>stall</b> was caused by the development of <b>the</b> diffuser <b>stall,</b> which transferred from the shroud side to the hub side in the vaneless space and expanded to the impeller passages...|$|R
