40|$|Tolerance design {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the modern design process by introducing quality improvements and limiting manufacturing costs. Tolerance synthesis is a procedure that distributes assembly <b>tolerances</b> <b>between</b> components or distributes final part design <b>tolerances</b> <b>between</b> related <b>tolerances.</b> Traditional tolerance design assumes that all objects have rigid geometry, overlooking the role of inertia effects on flexible components of assembly. The variance is increasingly stacked up as components are assembled without considering deformation due to inertia effects. This study deals with the optimal tolerance design for an assembly simultaneously considering manufacturing cost, quality loss and deformation due to inertia effect. An application problem (motor assembly) is used to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology...|$|R

40|$|Background: Telomere {{length is}} a {{putative}} biomarker of ageing, morbidity and mortality. Its application is hampered {{by lack of}} widely applicable reference ranges and uncertainty regarding the present limits of measurement reproducibility within and <b>between</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Methods: We instigated an international collaborative study of telomere length assessment: 10 different laboratories, employing 3 different techniques [Southern blotting, single telomere length analysis (STELA) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) ] performed two rounds of fully blinded measurements on 10 human DNA samples per round to enable unbiased assessment of intra- and inter-batch variation <b>between</b> <b>laboratories</b> and techniques. Results: Absolute results from different laboratories differed widely and could thus not be compared directly, but rankings of relative telomere lengths were highly correlated (correlation coefficients of 0. 63 - 0. 99). Intra-technique correlations were similar for Southern blotting and qPCR and were stronger than inter-technique ones. However, inter-laboratory coefficients of variation (CVs) averaged about 10 % for Southern blotting and STELA and more than 20 % for qPCR. This difference was compensated for by a higher dynamic range for the qPCR method as shown by equal variance after z-scoring. Technical variation per laboratory, measured as median of intra- and inter-batch CVs, ranged from 1. 4 % to 9. 5 %, with differences <b>between</b> <b>laboratories</b> only marginally significant (P = 0. 06). Gel-based and PCR-based techniques were not different in accuracy. Conclusions: Intra- and inter-laboratory technical variation severely limits the usefulness of data pooling and excludes sharing of reference ranges <b>between</b> <b>laboratories.</b> We propose to establish {{a common set of}} physical telomere length standards to improve comparability of telomere length estimates <b>between</b> <b>laboratories...</b>|$|R
