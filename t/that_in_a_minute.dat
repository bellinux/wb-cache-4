40|$|Olivine-type LiFePO 4 is {{nowadays}} one of {{the most}} important cathode materials of choice for high-energy lithium ion batteries. Its intrinsic defectivity, and chiefly the so-called lithium iron anti-site, is {{one of the}} most critical issues when envisaging electrochemical applications. This paper reports a combined diffractometric (Synchrotron Radiation XRD with Rietveld and PDF analyses) and spectroscopic (Mössbauer) approach able to give a thorough characterization of the material defectivity. Such analytical procedure has been applied to a sample prepared following an innovative microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis route <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> allowed us to obtain a well crystallized material. PDF analysis, which is applied for the first time to this type of battery material, reveals the presence of disorder possibly due to Li/Fe exchange or to a local symmetry lowering. A 5 % amount of iron on the lithium site has been detected both by PDF as well as by Mössbauer spectroscopy, which revealed a small percentage of Fe 3 + on the regular sites. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

He divides philology into five parts: first, an inquiry into public acts, with a knowledge of times and places, into civil institutions, and also into law; second, an inquiry into private affairs; third, an exhibition of the religions and arts of the ancient nations; fourth, a history of all their moral and physical speculations and beliefs, and of their literatures; and fifth, a complete explanation of the language.|$|R
50|$|After the Battle of the Bulge, Allied Armies {{advanced}} {{into the}} Rhineland <b>in</b> preparation for <b>a</b> planned massive assault across the Rhine {{into the heart}} of the Reich. Worms was a German strong point in the southern Rhineland on the West bank of the Rhine and the German forces there resisted the Allied advance tenaciously. Worms was thus heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the last few months of World War II — in two attacks, on Feb. 21 and March 18, 1945. A post-war survey estimated that 39 per cent of the town's developed area was destroyed. The RAF attack on Feb. 21 was aimed at the main train station, on the edge of the inner city, and at chemical plants southwest of the inner city. The attack, however, also destroyed large areas of the city centre. The attack was carried out by 334 bombers <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> rained 1,100 tons of bombs on the inner city. The Worms Cathedral was among the buildings set afire in the resulting conflagration. The Americans did not enter the city until the Rhine crossings began after the seizure of the Remagen Bridge.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the security of}} Diffie-Hellman key exchange as used in popular Internet protocols and find it to be less secure than widely believed. First, we present Logjam, <b>a</b> novel flaw <b>in</b> TLS <b>that</b> lets <b>a</b> man-in-the-middle downgrade connections to " export-grade " Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, we implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long precomputation for a specified 512 -bit group, we can compute arbitrary discrete logs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> group <b>in</b> about <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> We find that 82 % of vulnerable servers use a single 512 -bit group, allowing us to compromise connections to 7 % of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. In response, major browsers are being changed to reject short groups. We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768 -and 1024 -bit groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are in use by millions of servers. Performing precomputations for just ten of these groups would allow a passive eavesdropper to decrypt traffic to up to 66 % of IPsec VPN servers, 26 % of SSH servers, 24 % of popular HTTPS sites, or 16 % of SMTP servers. In the 1024 -bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange methods should be a priority for the Internet community...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that sex is <b>a</b> risk factor <b>in</b> acquiring <b>a</b> traumatic brain injury (TBI) among adolescents, {{it has not been}} established whether it also moderates the influence of other TBI psychological health correlates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were derived from a 2011 population-based cross-sectional school survey, which included 9, 288 Ontario 7 th- 12 th graders who completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires in classrooms. Response rate was 62 %. Preliminary analyses found no evidence of nonresponse bias in the reporting of TBI. TBI was defined as a hit or blow to the head <b>that</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5 <b>minutes</b> loss of consciousness or at least one overnight hospitalization due to symptoms associated with it. Reports of lifetime TBI were more common among males than females (23. 1 %, 95 % CI: 20. 5, 25. 8 vs. 17. 1 %, 95 % CI: 14. 7, 19. 8). Thirteen correlates were examined and included cigarette smoking, elevated psychological distress, suicide ideation, bully victimization (at school, as well as cyber bullying), bullying others, cannabis use, cannabis dependence and drug use problems, physical injuries, daily smoking, drinking alcohol, binge drinking, use of cannabis, and poor academic performance. Among the outcomes examined, sex moderated the relationship between lifetime TBI and cigarette smoking. In addition, sex and age jointly moderated the relationship between lifetime TBI and daily smoking, alcohol use and physical injuries. Late adolescent males who reported lifetime TBI, relative to females, displayed elevated daily smoking and injuries, whereas their females counterparts displayed elevated past year drinking. Possible bias related to self-report procedures and the preclusion of causal inferences due to the cross-sectional nature of the data are limitations of this study. CONCLUSIONS: TBI differences in outcomes need to be assessed for potential moderating effects of sex and age. Results have important implications for more tailored injury prevention efforts...|$|R

6000|$|She noticed first what clothes he had on--his newest suit, dark grey, {{with little}} lighter lines--she had chosen it herself; that his tie {{was in a}} bow, not a sailor's knot, and his hair {{brighter}} than usual--as always just after being cut; and surely the hair was growing down again {{in front of his}} ears. Then, gratefully, almost with emotion, she realized that his lips were quivering, his whole face quivering. He came in on tiptoe, stood looking at her a minute, then crossed very swiftly to the bed, very swiftly knelt down, and, taking her hand, turned it over and put his face to it. The bristles of his moustache tickled her palm; his nose flattened itself against her fingers, and his lips kept murmuring words into the hand, with the moist warm touch of his lips. Gyp knew he was burying there all his remorse, perhaps the excesses he had committed while she had been away from him, burying the fears he had felt, and the emotion at seeing her so white and still. She felt <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he would raise a quite different face. And it flashed through her: [...] "If I loved him I wouldn't mind what he did--ever! Why don't I love him?
