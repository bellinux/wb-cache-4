5|$|Rules on the {{acquisition}} of land are covered in Part III of the Act. Until {{the passage of the}} Act, <b>trustees</b> had no right to purchase land with trust money, with two exceptions; first, if the trust instrument authorised or required the trustee to purchase land and second, Section 6(4) of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of <b>Trustees</b> Act 1996, which allowed <b>trustees</b> to buy land either as an investment or for habitation by the beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of <b>trustees</b> for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the <b>trustees</b> appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on <b>trustees</b> who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, <b>trustees</b> are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, <b>trustees</b> are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

5000|$|The U.S. <b>Trustee's</b> office conducts {{the first}} meeting of {{creditors}} in a Chapter 11 case. Most Chapter 11's do not require the appointment of a trustee: however, in those cases which do, the U.S. <b>Trustee</b> oversees the appointed <b>trustee's</b> handling of the case and, for good cause, can seek the removal or replacement of the <b>trustee.</b> The U.S. <b>Trustee</b> may not, however, serve as the case <b>trustee</b> in Chapter 11.

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by <b>trustees,</b> but there is no relationship between the <b>trustees</b> and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the <b>trustees</b> of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other <b>trustees</b> and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the <b>trustees.</b> Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E
5|$|The Charity Commission has {{the power}} to issue an inquiry into a charity under Section 46 of the 2011 act and, if they are {{satisfied}} there has been mismanagement, they are allowed to suspend <b>trustees</b> or officers, appoint additional <b>trustees,</b> vest charity property in the Official Custodian for Charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to transfer it without their permission. They can also remove <b>trustees</b> on the grounds of bankruptcy, mental incapacity, failure to act or the trustee's absence from the country. The Commission is also authorised to appoint new <b>trustees</b> to replace removed ones, or even {{to increase the number of}} <b>trustees.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Culinary Institute of America is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} governed by a 24-member board of <b>trustees.</b> These <b>trustees</b> are elected to three-year terms by the Members of the Corporation, the stakeholders of the CIA.

30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the expected behavior of <b>trustee</b> is beyond the trustor’s control; the trustor’s belief in that expected behavior of <b>trustee</b> is based on the <b>trustee’s</b> capability, goodwill (including intension or motivation), and integrity. The integrity of the <b>trustee</b> gives the trustor confidence about the predictability of the <b>trustee’s</b> behavior.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States {{a private}} <b>trustee</b> is a {{position}} set {{up through a}} trust indenture.

5000|$|Mara v Browne 1895 is a Court of Chancery {{case that}} dealt with {{liability}} as a constructive <b>trustee</b> ultimately ruling that, [...] "if one, not being a <b>trustee</b> and not having authority from a <b>trustee,</b> takes upon himself to inter-meddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic {{of the office of}} <b>trustee,</b> he may therefore make himself what is called in law <b>trustee</b> of his own wrong - i.e., a <b>trustee</b> de son tort, or, as it is also termed, a constructive trustee" ...|$|R
50|$|Trust {{creditors}} (that is, {{persons who}} have become creditors of the <b>trustee</b> qua <b>trustee)</b> may be entitled to be subrogated to the <b>trustee's</b> lien. This is a particularly precarious 'right' of trust creditors: a <b>trustee</b> {{may not have a}} right of indemnity (for example, because the <b>trustee</b> has committed a breach of trust in incurring the liability to the creditor in question) or it may be limited (for example, where the <b>trustee</b> has committed an unrelated breach of trust and the clear accounts rule operates). In some jurisdictions it is possible for the <b>trustee's</b> right of indemnity to be excluded altogether. In these cases, subrogation may be rendered worthless or impossible.|$|R
5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new <b>trustees,</b> except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of <b>trustees,</b> to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The <b>trustees</b> may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E

5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that the <b>trustees</b> had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but the <b>trustees</b> did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and the <b>trustees</b> became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to the <b>trustees</b> for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and the <b>trustees</b> had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E

PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the <b>trustees</b> thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.|$|E

500|$|This {{test has}} both an {{objective}} and subjective element.

It indicates that a professional <b>trustee</b> would be held to a higher standard than a family <b>trustee.</b> The subjective element requires a court to exercise greater scrutiny if a <b>trustee</b> had any special skills, which takes the <b>trustee's</b> ability above the objective baseline.
