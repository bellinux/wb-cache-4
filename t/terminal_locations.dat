25|$|As part of {{a seven-year}} {{strategic}} commercial partnership between Gatwick and EasyJet, the airport proposed a number of changes to individual airlines' <b>terminal</b> <b>locations.</b> These would see EasyJet consolidate all its Gatwick operations in the North Terminal, while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic would swap their terminals. Gatwick believes that these terminal moves improve the airport's operational efficiency and resilience, {{as the use of}} different terminals by EasyJet and British Airways reduces pressure on the North Terminal's check-in, security, boarding and ramp areas at peak times. In addition, a terminal swap by Virgin frees up lounge and gate space for BA long-haul passengers in the South Terminal and, unlike BA's current short-haul schedules, Virgin's long-haul schedules do not clash with EasyJet's busy schedule in the North Terminal due to the airlines' differing peak times.|$|E
500|$|In New Zealand, {{mountain}} glaciers {{have been}} in general retreat since 1890, with an acceleration since 1920. Most have measurably thinned and reduced in size, and the snow accumulation zones have risen in elevation as the 20th century progressed. Between 1971–75 Ivory Glacier receded [...] from the glacial terminus, and about 26% of its surface area was lost. Since 1980 numerous small glacial lakes formed behind the new terminal moraines of several of these glaciers. Glaciers such as Classen, Godley and Douglas now all have new glacial lakes below their <b>terminal</b> <b>locations</b> due to the glacial retreat over the past 20 years. Satellite imagery indicates that these lakes are continuing to expand. There has been significant and ongoing ice volume losses on the largest New Zealand glaciers, including the Tasman, Ivory, Classen, Mueller, Maud, Hooker, Grey, Godley, Ramsay, Murchison, Therma, Volta and Douglas Glaciers. The retreat of these glaciers {{has been marked by}} expanding proglacial lakes and terminus region thinning. [...] The loss in Southern Alps total ice volume from 1976–2014 is 34percent of the total.|$|E

[...] Travel on Highway 7 begins east at the Alberta - Saskatchewan provincial border through the Missouri Coteau which features mixed prairie vegetation. [...] Entering Alberta, the highway continues west as Alberta Highway 9. Alsask is a village of about 150 people on the border and Highway 44. The Military Dome site radar station is a heritage site and has been acquired by Alsask along with the 1960s airforce base. At Alsask, Highway 7 turns north east until km 3.9 when again the highway is routed east. [...] Again at km 6.1 the highway turns north east until km 19.8 just past the intersection with Highway 317. [...] Marengo, a small village of about 50 residents is [...] north of the junction. [...] Highway 7 continues for several kilometres east reaching the village of Flaxcombe, which {{has a population of}} just over 100. Highway 307 north provides access to the villages of Coleville and Smiley. [...] This area belongs to the West Central Regional Economic Development Authority (REDA). [...] The town of Kindersley is the largest center featuring both oil and agricultural industries along Highway 7 and with a population of about 4,500 is almost at city status of 5,000 residents. [...] As of 2009, the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) ranges from approximately 1,600 to 2,000 vehicles per day (vpd) near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to over 3,000 vpd near Kindersley, updated statistics, and vehicle types in 2013 show evidence that the 2009 vehicle count is out of date and severely understates actual traffic flow. Due to its being a key route between Calgary, the fast-growing city of Saskatoon, and economic drivers such as regional oil activity, inland grain <b>terminal</b> <b>locations</b> adjacent to Hwy 7, and Saskatchewan's strong economy, this highway's capacity is under pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> is an {{important}} area of research because of its application in location-sensitive browsing and resource allocation. This paper presents a method for reducing the error in mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> estimation. A model-based dynamic filter is presented which uses an accurate model of mobile terminal motion to combine information from location measurements made at different time instances together to create an improved location estimate. The model of mobile terminal motion has a kinematic state space model describing the physical rules governing terminal motion and a control model that describes the human control input into the motion process. The dependency between the <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> and the control decisions is used to derive a new dynamic filter. This filter provides better accuracy than previously known location techniques and is robust to variations in the mobile terminal motion. I...|$|R

40|$|Truck {{transportation}} is {{considered as a}} favourable mode by shippers to carry freight at most ranges of distance as it has more flexibility in fleet size, capacity, scheduling, routing, and access. Although truck is considered as the popular mode for freight transportation, road-rail intermodal freight transportation becomes an attractive alternative to road only mode since the latter has no longer assured a reliable service due to traffic congestion problem. It also raises public concern in environmental and road safety impacts. Intermodal freight {{transportation is}} defined as a system that carries freight from origin to destination using two or more transportation modes where transfers between modes occur at an intermodal freight terminal. Success of the terminal depends on four major factors, namely: location, efficiency, financial sustainability, and rail level of service. Among these, the location {{is one of the most}} crucial success factors and needs to be considered carefully as it has direct and indirect impacts on a number of stakeholders including terminal users, terminal operators, transport network infrastructure providers, and community. Limitations of previous <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> evaluation models in representing individual preference and behaviour as well as accommodating negotiation and communication between the players bring in an opportunity to develop a new model which is more flexible and capable of providing a solution that is not necessary to be optimal, but acceptable for every player without requiring explicit trade-offs. This thesis is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of applying an agent-based approach to the evaluation of intermodal freight <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> and investigating <b>terminal</b> effectiveness against stakeholder equity and some important aspects arising from the different stakeholders’ viewpoints. Agent technologies were introduced to model the stakeholders as individual agents. The agent concept was adopted to develop a decentralised location evaluation system that is able to balance the terminal effectiveness with the stakeholder equity. The proposed agent-based location evaluation model was modelled as a hierarchical control system that comprises three decision levels: local level, stakeholder level and policy level. Policy level is the highest decision level, which is represented by a policy maker. Apart from the policy level, the rest can be viewed as operational decision levels. Local level is the lowest control level. At this level, each stakeholder was classified into stakeholder groups based on their characteristics and interest. The terminal scenarios were then evaluated based on benefit maximisation criteria. Stakeholder control is the higher control level than the local level. It represents the control level where negotiations and decisions between groups of people (stakeholders) with different point of views are made. At this level, negotiation process was used to determine <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> based on preference and equity of stakeholders. The determined terminal site was then used in the evaluation against constraints to ensure that all agents are satisfied. The <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> decision for South East Queensland (SEQ) was applied as a case study of this thesis. The SEQ strategic freight transport model was developed, calibrated, and validated to assist in providing inputs for the evaluation of <b>terminal</b> <b>location.</b> The results indicated that for the developed agent-based location evaluation model, Yatala was selected as the most appropriate <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> that results in the highest effectiveness and equity (as measured by level of satisfaction and Gini coefficient, respectively). Other location evaluation models were also used in comparison with the developed agent-based location evaluation model. Those include P-Median, P-Centre, and maximum covering models. It was found that the agent-based location evaluation model outperformed the other location evaluation models. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the consistency of model outputs against the uncertainties in the input parameters. In most cases, the <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> decisions obtained from the developed agent-based location evaluation model was not sensitive to the changes in those parameters. However, the results suggested that when a unit cost of truck travel delay increased, the impact on the final <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> decisions was observed. This thesis demonstrated the feasibility of applying a decentralised approach to <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> decision problem using a multi-agent concept and evaluating it against other well-known location problems. A new framework and methodology for the planning of intermodal <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> evaluation was also formulated. Finally, the problems of <b>terminal</b> <b>location</b> evaluation and optimisation of intermodal freight terminal operation were integrated into a single evaluation model...|$|R
