40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} towards head pose estimation is introduced based on Gabor eigenspace modeling. Gabor filter is used <b>to</b> enhance <b>pose</b> information and eliminate other distractive information like variable face appearance or changing environmental illumination. We discuss {{the selection of}} optimal Gabor filter’s orientation <b>to</b> each <b>pose,</b> which leads <b>to</b> more compact <b>pose</b> clustering. Then we use a distributionbased <b>pose</b> model (DBPM) <b>to</b> model each <b>pose</b> cluster in Gabor eigenspace. Thus <b>to</b> each <b>pose</b> cluster, a 2 Ddistance space is established where the distance from centroid (DFC) could be used <b>to</b> estimate head <b>pose.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm’s robustness and generalization. We also try our algorithm on real scene sequences to detect human face and estimate its pose. In this way, user can control an intelligent wheelchair just by his head poses. 1...|$|R
