Since other anion transport inhibitors {{have been shown}} to inhibit activity of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), the present study investigated the effects of <b>tenidap</b> on activity of this channel in pancreatic β-cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] <b>Tenidap,</b> a new {{anti-rheumatic}} agent, is a lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and {{is reported}} to inhibit the production and action of interleukin 1 (IL- 1). Since eicosanoids, IL- 1, and other cytokines may influence the growth of fibroblasts in the joint synovium the study was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of <b>Tenidap</b> on cytokine induced proliferation of these cells in vitro. METHODS [...] Cell cultures derived from patients with a variety of rheumatic diseases were cultured in different concentrations of <b>Tenidap</b> sodium, with or without IL- 1, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), IL- 6, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). Cell proliferation was measured using a crystal violet colourimetric assay. Prostaglandin E 2 levels in culture supernatants were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS [...] <b>Tenidap</b> at concentrations above 10 micrograms/ml inhibited cell growth, while at 1. 25 - 5 micrograms/ml there was a small but significant increase in proliferation compared with controls. A further increase in growth was obtained when cells were incubated with Tenidap+IL- 1, TNF or bFGF, and this was significantly higher than in the presence of any cytokine alone. Stimulation of IL- 1 induced growth by <b>Tenidap</b> was reduced by addition of high levels of exogenous PGE 2 (100 ng/ml) although growth was still higher than in IL- 1 alone. CONCLUSIONS [...] Depending on concentration, <b>Tenidap</b> may inhibit or stimulate synovial fibroblast growth. Our results suggest that augmentation of growth by low concentrations cannot be explained by inhibition of PGE 2 production alone. <b>Tenidap</b> may directly stimulate cell growth or may block other fibroblast factors which are involved in control of cytokine induced proliferation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{maintenance}} of articular cartilage integrity during long term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is of clinical importance. These experiments {{were set up}} to test the action of <b>tenidap,</b> naproxen, and diclofenac on bovine and porcine cartilage, matrix synthesis, and catabolism. METHODS [...] Short term organ culture techniques {{were used to determine}} the effect of interleukin 1 (IL- 1) on synthesis and degradation, and the action of <b>tenidap</b> and the other drugs on these parameters. The retention of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the synthesis of GAGs by incorporation of sulphur- 35 labelled sulphate was used to determine the chondrocyte metabolic activity. RESULTS [...] The action of human recombinant interleukin 1 alpha (hrIL- 1 alpha) in increasing catabolic activity and inhibiting synthetic activity of the animal cartilages was confirmed. <b>Tenidap</b> was shown to give substantial and significant protection against the catabolic effects of hrIL- 1 alpha and, to a lesser degree, against the inhibition of matrix synthesis by the cytokine. Neither diclofenac nor naproxen in doses expected to occur in the synovial fluid showed this action. <b>Tenidap</b> also inhibited the GAG loss from cocultures and, to a moderate degree, reversed the inhibition of synthesis by synovial tissue. <b>Tenidap</b> also stimulated cartilage repair activity during recovery from IL- 1 treatment. The optimum concentration of the action against IL- 1 was between 5 and 10 micrograms/ml. Above this concentration <b>tenidap</b> itself showed some inhibitory action on GAG synthesis.

The model was induced by injecting 5 mg/ml ovalbumin into the knees of 20 preimmunized rabbits. Animals were randomized into two groups: treated with <b>tenidap</b> (15 mg/kg per 12 h), or untreated. The effect of <b>tenidap</b> treatment was evaluated on chemokine production in synovial membranes of rabbits with arthritis and in cultured monocytic and synovial cells (SC). By immunoperoxidase staining, chemokines were localized in the synovial tissue. Chemokine messenger RNA levels in the synovial membranes and in cultured cells were analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the end of the study, <b>tenidap</b> significantly reduced neutrophil infiltration into the joint cavity (27 ± 4 × 106 cells/ml versus 45 ± 6 × 106 cells/ml in untreated; P < 0. 05), and synovial effusion (134 ± 15 μl versus 236 ± 19 μl in untreated; P < 0. 005). Untreated rabbits showed synovial membrane up-regulation in mRNA expression of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 (11 - and seven-fold versus healthy rabbits, respectively) that was markedly decreased by <b>tenidap</b> (two- and three-fold versus healthy rabbits, respectively). IL- 8 and MCP- 1 were localized in the synovial tissue in a perivascular pattern and areas of the interstitium and lining, mostly coinciding with cell infiltration. <b>Tenidap</b> also reduced the accumulation of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 proteins.

Design: Study: multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, 1 year duration. Patients: primary painful knee osteoarthritis (ACR criteria) of the medial tibiofemoral compartment, medial joint space width ≥ 2 mm, at least 10 % of one cartilage surface of the medial compartment affected by superficial fibrillation or worse at baseline arthroscopy. Study medication: once daily dosage of either <b>tenidap</b> 40 mg, <b>tenidap</b> 120 mg or piroxicam 20 mg. Study endpoints: bilateral extended weight-bearing X-rays and knee arthroscopy under local anaesthesia were done at entry and after 1 year. Joint space width was measured in millimeters at the narrowest point of the medial compartment. Chondropathy was scored by using reader's overall assessment (VAS score, 100 mm) and Société Française d'Arthroscopie (SFA) score (0 – 100). Results: Patients (665) were randomized and 494 completed the study. After 1 year, intra-group radiological changes and radiological difference between both <b>tenidap</b> groups and the piroxicam group did not reach statistical significance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of pharmacological agents in the inhibition of Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and PGE 2 in explants of interface membranes from failed total hip replacements (fTHR). Material and methods Membranes from fTHR were retrieved (N= 20) and explants were incubated for 72 h in the absence or presence of <b>tenidap</b> at three different concentrations (5, 20 or 50 μg/ml) or diclofenac (125 μg/l). IL- 1 β, IL- 6, TNF-α, and PGE 2 levels were measured in the culture medium using ELISA Capture or EIA kits. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Results A statistically significant inhibition in IL- 1 β synthesis was found at <b>tenidap</b> concentrations of 20 μg/ml (71. 3 %, P< 0. 05) and 50 μg/ml (79. 3 %,P< 0. 02). <b>Tenidap</b> reduced IL- 6 levels by 90. 4 % at 20 μg/ml (P< 0. 005) and 96. 0 % (P< 0. 05) at 50 μg/ml. <b>Tenidap</b> also reduced the synthesis of TNF-α by 66. 9 % (P< 0. 05) and 77. 4 % at concentrations of 20 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml. <b>Tenidap</b> had a marked suppressive effect of over 90 % (P< 0. 0001) on PGE 2 synthesis in all three concentrations. Diclofenac (125 μg/l) decreased PGE 2 production by 95 % (P< 0. 0001), but had no significant effect in IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and TNF-α levels in the culture medium. Conclusion The ability to simultaneously suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines and PGE 2 may help control osteolysis and prevent aseptic loosening of THR. This effect could increase implant longevity and lead the way to the pharmacological treatment of this pathology.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{examine the}} effects of non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDS) on nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production in chondrocytes from three different species. Methods: We have estimated NO production by Griess method, and PGE 2 by RIA from the supernatant of articular cartilage obtained from osteoarthritis joints (OA-affected cartilage), rat chondrosarcomas (inex vivoconditions) and bovine chondrocytes (stimulated with cytokines+endotoxin inin vitroconditions) in {{the presence or absence of}} aspirin, indomethacin, sodium salicylate, <b>tenidap</b> and glucocorticoids. Results: NO, which was spontaneously released inex vivoconditions by OA-affected cartilage and rat chondrosarcomas (maintainedin vivo), was susceptible to inhibition by pharmacologically relevant concentrations of aspirin, sodium salicylate and <b>tenidap,</b> but not to concentrations of indomethacin or glucocorticoids that significantly inhibited PGE 2 production under the same conditions. Similarly, the production of NO by bovine chondrocytes grown in monolayer cultures that had been stimulated with cytokines+endotoxins (in vitro) to release both No and PGE 2 (at 48 – 72 h post stimulation), were inhibited by aspirin, sodium salicylate and <b>tenidap,</b> but not by indomethacin or glucocorticoids at concentrations sufficient to inhibit PGE 2 production. Inhibition of NO in the cytokines+endotoxin stimulated bovine chondrocytes (like the human OA-affected cartilage) augmented PGE 2 production.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{is probably}} the most common source of treatable disability in the Western world. There are several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which have proven to be of therapeutic efficacy in RA, but the lack of a potent, reliable treatment for early RA is a major problem in modern medicine. An obvious line of approach in the quest for better antirheumatic drugs is to determine, as closely as possible, the mechanisms of action of the existing DMARDs. In this thesis, several DMARDs have been tested using mouse macrophages. A system of assays has been used to determine their effects on some identified steps in macrophage signal transduction, like the receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C, the activation of protein kinase C, the up-regulation of the macrophage high-molecular phospholipase A 2 and the release of bioactive eicosanoids. The effects of these DMARDs on the induction and release of the key proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has also been determined. The DMARDs auranofin, <b>tenidap</b> and antimalarials all inhibit arachidonate release induced by zymosan. Auranofin and <b>tenidap</b> also have multiple effects on protein phosphorylation. Among the drugs tested, auranofin is the most potent inhibitor of the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, irrespective of stimulus. <b>Tenidap</b> inhibits the zymosan-induced expression of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha. It also inhibits the LPS-induced expression of IL- 1, but potentiates the expression of TNF-alpha due to its cyclooxygenase inhibition. The antimalarial compounds, particularly quinacrine, also inhibit the induction of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha. Hydrophilic gold compounds, D-penicillamine, methotrexate and sulfasalazine do not affect the induction of IL- 1 of TNF-alpha in macrophages. Three drugs (auranofin, <b>tenidap</b> and quinacrine) that inhibit zymosan-induced phospholipase A 2 activation also inhibit the zymosan-induced expression of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha. It is interesting to speculate {{that there might be a}} common step in the MAP kinase cascade, leading to phospholipase A 2 up-regulation and the activation of NK-kappaB and/or other transcription factors regulating the induction of IL- 1 and TNF-alpha. Considering the pivotal importance of TNF-alpha and IL- 1 in RA, it is interesting that several DMARDs act as inhibitors of the induction of these cytokines in macrophages...|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the formation of}} pores in rat submandibular acinar cells in response to 2 ', 3 '-O-(4 -benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (Bz-ATP) and maitotoxin. Bz-ATP (100 microM) permeabilized the cells to ethidium bromide. The uptake of ethidium increased to 29 +/- 1 % of maximal uptake in 10 min. DL-Propranolol (300 microM) inhibited the Bz-ATP-induced uptake of ethidium bromide by 40 % without affecting the P 2 X(7) -gated cation channel. The inhibitory effect of DL-propranolol on the formation of pores by Bz-ATP was reproduced by D-propranolol, an optical isomer with very poor beta-blocking activity. <b>Tenidap,</b> an antiinflammatory drug, enhanced the permeabilization in response to Bz-ATP. Propanolol inhibited the response to <b>tenidap</b> plus Bz-ATP. The effect of propranolol was reproduced by labetolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist with membrane-stabilizing properties, but not by atenolol, which blocks beta-adrenergic receptors but {{has no effect on}} the stability of the membrane. In the presence of extracellular calcium, maitotoxin also increased the uptake of ethidium bromide. <b>Tenidap</b> had no effect on this response, which was delayed by propranolol. In conclusion, we have shown that propranolol, in a range of 10 - 300 microM, inhibits the pore-forming activity of the P 2 X(7) receptor without affecting the opening of the cation channel coupled to this receptor. This inhibition is not related to its beta-adrenergic blocking activity but rather to its membrane-stabilizing properties. Propranolol also delays the uptake of ethidium bromide in response to maitotoxin. This is in agreement with the current view that P 2 X(7) agonists and maitotoxin share a common pore.

40|$|<b>TENIDAP</b> (TD) was {{initially}} {{defined as a}} dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. This {{study was designed to}} assess its inhibitory activity against proinflammatory phosphoHpase A 2. This study shows that TD inhibits the synthesis of pro-inflammatory secretory non-pancreatic phospholipase A (sPLA 2). Concentrations as low as 0. 251 lg/ml (0. 725 JIM) reduced the release of sPLA by 40 % from foetal rat calvarial osteoblasts stimulated with IL-I and TNF, whereas a concentration of 2. 5 tg/ml (7. 25 IIM) reduced the release by over 800 / 0. TD also markedly reduced the release of sPLA from unstimulated cells. There was no direct inhibition of sPLA enzymatic activity by TD in vitro. Northern blot analysis showed that TD did not affect the sPLA mRNA levels; however, immunoblotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in sPLA enzyme. These results, together with a marked reduction in sPLA enzymatic activity, suggest that TD inhibits sPLA synthesis at the post-transcriptional level. Therefore TD seems to inhibit the arachidonic acid cascade proximally to cyclooxygenase and ltpoxygenase and its anti-inflammatory activity may be related at least in part to the inhibition of sPLA synthesis. <b>Tenidap</b> sodium inhibits secretory non-pancreatic phospholipase A synthesis by foetal rat calvarial osteoblast...|$|E
40|$|It was {{recently}} proposed that, in rat pancreatic islets, {{the production of}} bicarbonate accounts for the major fraction of the carbon dioxide generated by the oxidative catabolism of nutrient insulin secretagogues. In search of the mechanism(s) supporting the membrane transport of bicarbonate, the possible role of the electrogenic Na(+) -HCO(3) (-) -cotransporters NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B in rat pancreatic islet cells was investigated. Expression of NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B in rat pancreatic islet cells was documented by RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. The latter procedure suggested a preferential localization of NBCe 1 -B in insulin-producing cells. <b>Tenidap</b> (3 - 100 microM), previously proposed as an inhibitor of NBCe 1 -A-mediated cotransport in proximal tubule kidney cells, caused a concentration-related inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Insulin output from the BRIN-BD 11 cells was stimulated by 2 -ketoisocaproate (KIC) or extracellular hypoosmolarity. cAMP analogs and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine increased the insulin output recorded in the isotonic medium to a greater relative extent than that in the hypotonic medium. The secretory response to KIC or hypotonicity was inhibited by NPPB or <b>tenidap,</b> which both also opposed the enhancing action of cAMP analogs. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase decreased insulin output in isotonic and hypotonic media. The inhibitor of sAC, 2 -hydroxyestriol, caused only a modest inhibition of insulin release, whether in the isotonic or hypotonic medium, even when tested at a concentration of 100 μM. The omission of NaHCO 3 markedly decreased the secretory response to KIC or extracellular hypotonicity. The omission of Na+ suppressed the secretory response to extracellular hypotonicity.

In a recent study, it was used to conduce the isolation of the bioactive compounds from Taxus wallichiana Zucc. thanks to its ethnopharmacological use in diseases including inflammation. Phytochemical studies lead to the isolation of abietane diterpenoids, namely Taxusabietane C (TC) and Taxamairin F (TF). Test compounds showed significant LOX inhibitory effects. IC 50 values of TC and TF were 69 +/- A 0. 31 and 73 +/- A 0. 14 mu M, respectively. The standard compound Baicalein and <b>Tenidap</b> sodium showed the IC 50 value being 22. 1 +/- A 0. 03 and 41. 6 +/- A 0. 02 mu M.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} that serum matrix metalloproteinase- 3 (MMP- 3) is a variable associated with disease activity {{and with the}} response to treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Serum MMP- 3 levels were measured and compared to biological and clinical disease activity variables in 20 patients with active RA assessed serially during a one year prospective open label trial with methotrexate or <b>tenidap.</b> RESULTS: MMP- 3 levels were significantly correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 serum levels {{as well as with}} the disease activity score (DAS), not only at start in untreated patients but also during the 12 month followup period in both treated groups. Early changes (after 0. 5, 1, 2, or 3 months) in MMP- 3 levels were significantly associated with change in DAS observed 4 to 6 months later. CONCLUSION: In addition to CRP, a systemic marker of inflammation, serum MMP- 3 may serve as a consistent synovial derived marker of RA disease activity, early changes of which predict disease outcome.

40|$|AbstractOsteoarthritis is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} complex illness in which interrelationships between the different tissues of the joint are important. We are still some way from a complete understanding of the pathophysiologic and temporal relationships between bone, synovial tissue and cartilage. Recent evidence points to a significant role for cytokines and growth factors in osteoarthritis {{that leads to a}} preponderance of catabolic processes in the joint. In-vitroculture of human cartilage {{has been used as a}} model to measure the effects of drugs used in the treatment of osteoarthritis on anabolic and catabolic processes. On this basis, the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be categorized into one of three classes depending on whether they are inhibitory (e. g., indomethacin and naproxen), neutral (e. g., diclofenac, aspirin and piroxicam) or stimulatory (e. g., aceclofenac, <b>tenidap</b> and tolmetin) of glycosaminoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes. The marked differences between these nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs suggest that a mechanism other than cyclooxygenase inhibition is involved in their effects on glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Inhibition of IL- 1 β and the stimulation of growth factors are suggested as possible mechanisms. Although the significance of these properties of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs awaits confirmation inin-vivoand clinical situations, they do provide the clinician with a new parameter with which to choose therapy in osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{expression}} of the electrogenic Na+-HCO 3 [...] cotransporter NBCe 1 was recently documented in rat pancreatic islet B-cells, it being speculated that such a protein participates in the extrusion of bicarbonate generated by the oxidative catabolism of nutrients from insulin-producing cells. Considering the prevalence of a Crabtree effect in tumoral insulin-producing cells, the possible presence of NBCe 1 was now investigated in BRIN-BD 11 cells, an insulin-producing cell line established by electrofusion of normal pancreatic B-cells with immortalized RINm 5 F cells. METHODS: The possible presence of NBCe 1 in BRIN-BD 11 cells was investigated by RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. The release of insulin and net uptake of 22 Na+ were also measured in the BRIN-BD 11 cells. RESULTS: RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry documented the presence of NBCe 1 in BRIN-BD 11 cells. A reported inhibitor of NBCe 1, i. e. <b>tenidap,</b> (50 - 100 microM), inhibited basal and hypotonicity-induced insulin release from the BRIN-BD 11 cells, whilst increasing the net uptake of 22 Na+ by the same cells. The latter effect was, in relative terms, more pronounced in the presence than absence of ouabain. CONCLUSION: BRIN-BD 11 cells, like normal pancreatic islet B-cells, express NBCe 1, with predominance of the B variant of this electrogenic Na+-HCO 3 [...] cotransporter.

40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} SLC 26 A 3 gene, also known as down-regulated in adenoma (hDRA), cause {{autosomal}} recessive congenital chloride-losing diarrhoea (CLD). hDRA expressed in Xenopus oocytes mediated bidirectional Cl−-Cl− and Cl−-HCO 3 − exchange. In contrast, transport of oxalate was low, and transport of sulfate and of butyrate was undetectable. Two CLD missense disease mutants of hDRA were nonfunctional in oocytes. Truncation of up to 44 C-terminal amino acids from the putatively cytoplasmic C-terminal hydrophilic domain left transport function unimpaired, but deletion of the adjacent STAS (sulfate transporter anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain abolished function. hDRA-mediated Cl− transport was insensitive to changing extracellular pH, but was inhibited by intracellular acidification and activated by NH 4 + at acidifying concentrations. These regulatory responses did not require the presence of either hDRA's N-terminal cytoplasmic tail or its 44 C-terminal amino acids, but they did require more proximate residues of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Although only weakly sensitive to inhibition by stilbenes, hDRA was inhibited with two orders of magnitude greater potency by the anti-inflammatory drugs niflumate and <b>tenidap.</b> cAMP-insensitive Cl−-HCO 3 − exchange mediated by hDRA gained modest cAMP sensitivity when co-expressed with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Despite the absence of hDRA transcripts in human cell lines derived from CFTR patients, DRA mRNA was present at wild-type levels in proximal colon and nearly so in the distal ileum of CFTR(-/-) mice. Thus, pharmacological modulation of DRA might be a useful adjunct treatment of cystic fibrosis...|$|E

Novel anti-inflammatory alternatives are still in urgent need. In this study, we designed and synthesized 30 indole- 2 -one and 7 -aza- 2 -oxindole derivatives based on the skeleton of <b>tenidap,</b> and their anti-inflammatory activity was determined by evaluating the inhibitory potency against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6 release in RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Quantitative SAR (structure–activity relationship) analysis revealed that a high molecular polarizability and low lipid/water partition coefficient (ALogP) in indole- 2 -one are beneficial for anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, compounds 7 i and 8 e inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL- 6, COX- 2, PGES, and iNOS in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and 7 i exhibited a significant protection from LPS-induced septic death in mouse models. These data present a series of new indole- 2 -one compounds with potential therapeutic effects in acute inflammatory diseases. Keywords: anti-inflammation, macrophages, sepsi...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2 [endoperoxide]) is an {{immediate}} product of prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase activity (cyclooxygenase) and a likely candidate to mediate endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Experiments {{were designed to}} investigate whether or not endothelium-dependent contractions were {{associated with an increased}} expression of PGH synthase, an augmented acetylcholine-induced release of PGH 2, and/or a hypersensitivity of the smooth muscle to endoperoxides in SHR aorta compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) aorta. In SHR aorta, endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine were abolished by <b>tenidap</b> (10 - 8 mol/L), a preferential PGH synthase- 1 inhibitor, but slightly impaired by NS- 398 (10 - 6 mol/L), a preferential PGH synthase- 2 inhibitor. PGH synthase- 1 expression, which was evaluated by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, was about twofold greater in preparations with endothelium from SHR than from WKY rats. There was no difference in PGH synthase- 1 expression between preparations with and those without endothelium in both strains. In SHR but not WKY aortas, acetylcholine (10 - 5 mol/L, 5 minutes) caused a significant endothelium-dependent release of PGH 2, as measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. PGH 2 evoked more potent contractions in rings without endothelium from SHR than from WKY rats, whereas the thromboxane analogue U 46619 and prostaglandin F(2 α) caused a comparable response in both preparations. These results show that endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in SHR aorta are associated with a greater expression of PGH synthase- 1, a significant release of PGH 2, and a hypersensitivity of the smooth muscle to the endoperoxide. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} specific cleavage of aggrecan at the Glu 373 –Ala 374 ‘aggrecanase’ site and degradation and release of proteoglycan catabolites from cartilage in explant cultures. Design: The monoclonal antibody, BC- 3, which specifically recognizes the new N-terminus, ARGSVIL, generated by cleavage of aggrecan at the Glu 373 –Ala 374 ‘aggrecanase’ site, was used to follow the generation of fragments produced by cleavage at this site as compared to degradation of proteoglycan as assessed by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release from cartilage in response to cytokines {{and the ability of}} inhibitors to block this cleavage. Results: (1) There was a strong correlation between specific cleavage at the Glu 373 –Ala 374 bond and the release of aggrecan catabolites in response to interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation. (2) This cleavage in the interglobular domain of aggrecan was inhibited by the inclusion of cycloheximide, thus indicating a requirement forde novoprotein synthesis in the induction of ‘aggrecanase’ activity. (3) The inhibitors, indomethacin, naproxen, <b>tenidap,</b> dexamethasone and doxycycline were ineffective in blocking either specific cleavage at the ‘aggrecanase’ site or aggrecan degradation as measured by GAG release from cartilage. (4) In contrast, compounds which act through two different mechanisms to inhibit MMPs were effective in blocking both specific cleavage at the ‘aggrecanase’ site and proteoglycan degradation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that ‘aggrecanase’ is primarily responsible for proteoglycan cleavage in these experimental systems and that this protease has properties in common with metalloproteases including members of the MMP and ADAM family. Inhibition of ‘aggrecanase’ may have utility in preventing cartilage loss in arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the electrogenic Na+/nHCO 3 − cotransporter (NBCe 1, SLC 4 A 4) {{cause severe}} {{proximal}} renal tubular acidosis, glaucoma, and cataracts in humans, indicating NBCe 1 has {{a critical role}} in acid-base homeostasis and ocular fluid transport. To better understand the homeostatic roles and protein ontogeny of NBCe 1, we have cloned, localized, and downregulated NBCe 1 expression in zebrafish, and examined its transport characteristics when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Zebrafish NBCe 1 (zNBCe 1) is 80 % identical to published mammalian NBCe 1 cDNAs. Like other fish NBCe 1 clones, zebrafish NBCe 1 is most similar to the pancreatic form of mammalian NBC (Slc 4 a 4 -B) but appears to be the dominant isoform found in zebrafish. In situ hybridization of embryos demonstrated mRNA expression in kidney pronephros and eye by 24 h postfertilization (hpf) and gill and brain by 120 hpf. Immunohistochemical labeling demonstrated expression in adult zebrafish eye and gill. Morpholino knockdown studies demonstrated roles in eye and brain development and caused edema, indicating altered fluid and electrolyte balance. With the use of microelectrodes to measure membrane potential (Vm), voltage clamp (VC), intracellular pH (pHi), or intracellular Na+ activity (aNai), we examined the function of zNBCe 1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Zebrafish NBCe 1 shared transport properties with mammalian NBCe 1 s, demonstrating electrogenic Na+ and HCO 3 − transport as well as similar drug sensitivity, including inhibition by 4, 4 ′-diiso-thiocyano- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid stilbene and <b>tenidap.</b> These data indicate that NBCe 1 in zebrafish shares many characteristics with mammalian NBCe 1, including tissue distribution, importance in systemic water and electrolyte balance, and electrogenic transport of Na+ and HCO 3 −.

40|$|We {{examined}} membrane trafficking of NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B {{variants of}} the electrogenic Na+-HCO 3 − cotransporter (NBCe 1) encoded by the SLC 4 A 4 gene, using confocal fluorescent microscopy in rat parotid acinar cells (ParC 5 and ParC 10). We showed that yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) -tagged NBCe 1 -A and {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) -tagged NBCe 1 -B are colocalized with E-cadherin in the basolateral membrane (BLM) {{but not with the}} apical membrane marker zona occludens 1 (ZO- 1). We inhibited constitutive recycling with monensin and W 13 and detected that NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B accumulated in vesicles marked with the early endosomal marker early endosome antigen- 1 (EEA 1), with a parallel loss from the BLM. We observed that NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B undergo massive carbachol (CCh) -stimulated redistribution from the BLM into early endosomes. We showed that internalization of NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B was prevented by the general PKC inhibitor GF- 109203 X, the PKCαβγ-specific inhibitor Gö- 6976, and the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin. We verified the involvement of PKCδ by blocking CCh-induced internalization of NBCe 1 -A-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in cells transfected with dominant-negative kinase-dead (Lys 376 Arg) PKCδ-GFP. Our data suggest that NBCe 1 -A and NBCe 1 -B undergo constitutive and CCh-stimulated endocytosis regulated by conventional PKCs (PKCαβγ) and by novel PKCδ in rat epithelial cells. To help develop a more complete model of the role of NBCe 1 in parotid acinar cells we also investigated the initial phase of the secretory response to cholinergic agonist. In an Ussing chamber study we showed that inhibition of basolateral NBCe 1 with 5 -chloro- 2, 3 -dihydro- 3 -(hydroxy- 2 -thienylmethylene) - 2 -oxo- 1 H-indole- 1 -carboxamide (<b>tenidap)</b> significantly decreases an initial phase of luminal anion secretion measured as a transient short-circuit current (Isc) across ParC 10 cell monolayers. Using trafficking and functional data we propose a model that describes a physiological role of NBC in salivary acinar cell secretion...|$|E
