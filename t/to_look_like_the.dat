5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes want <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the self-titled 1988 album by {{the band}} Method Actor, which {{featured}} Cassidy, was re-released by the band's guitarist and producer David Lourim with Cassidy's name displayed prominently on the cover. The Cassidy family and Blix Street Records {{filed a lawsuit}} against Lourim, claiming that Cassidy's name was used in a misleading fashion and that Blix Street has exclusive rights to her recordings. Lourim had Cassidy's written permission to release the album, and eventually the cover was changed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original LP album while already released copies were affixed with a sticker indicating that they are not solo Eva Cassidy albums.|$|E

5|$|Skopje has a {{bus network}} {{managed by the}} city and {{operated}} by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines. However, most of the network {{is still in the}} hands of JSP which operates 67 lines on 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP buses are (by Chinese buse builder Yutong) red double-decker buses designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> British-made buses that were in use in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{film was}} also tied into the books. A novelization {{of the movie}} was written <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> older books. Two books were also written for the Girl Detective and Clue Crew series that deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the Girl Detective series was re-branded into trilogies {{and to have a}} model on the cover. The mysteries became deeper, with Nancy often making mistakes. These trilogies were also met with {{negative}} fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. Simon & Schuster then cut back from six to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers series.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall {{similar to the one}} in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
