40|$|In {{some areas}} an {{increasing}} population causes an increasing population density and, hence, increases demand for food {{of the particular}} areas. To produce more food people usually expand their cultivation area onto steep, unsuitable for annual crops, areas. In many cases this expansion results in a deterioration of natural resources due to rapid runoff and erosion. An integrated soil conservation program, therefore, is necessary to be implemented on these areas to minimize soil erosion and maintain the productivity. The impact of the program on the annual soil loss can be measured or escalated by some methods: iron pins, sediment <b>tank,</b> <b>sediment</b> sampling from a gauge station, and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE).

40|$|Haliotrema abaddon is a {{significant}} monogenean parasite of the gills of maricultured Western Australian dhufish, Glaucosoma hebraicum, and can cause severe gill pathology. A series of trials was undertaken using infested fish in 120 -l glass aquaria to assess the safety and efficacy of some potential “in water” treatments, including trichlorphon, praziquantel, formalin, toltrazuril and a freshwater bath.

OCR and AER exhibited {{a significant negative}} correlation to body weight (BW), expressed as a power function of BW: OCR = 0. 09 Ã— BW âˆ’ 0. 58 (mgO 2 /g/h, r 2 = 0. 89, n= 15) and AER = 0. 38 Ã— BW âˆ’ 0. 19 (Î¼molN/g/h, r 2 = 0. 54, n = 15). These values were comparable to those in previous studies on other sea cucumber species. The OCR of shrimp <b>tank</b> <b>sediment</b> was reduced to less than half (4. 5 Â± 0. 3 to 1. 0 Â± 0. 1 mgO 2 /gdry/h) by the ingestion and excretion process of H. scabra.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{whether or}} not the shape of the grains affected the distribution of sediment on the foreshore slope. Experiments were conducted in both the laboratory and the field. In the laboratory, experiments were performed in a wave <b>tank.</b> <b>Sediment</b> was placed upon an artificial slope, and experiments were run using the three different slopes and wave stages. Results indicated that the roundness increased toward the top of the foreshore. Although no definite conclusions could be drawn about sphericity, the figures indicated that sphericity also increased towards the top of the foreshore. The field analysis was conducted on Tremblay Beach Conservation Area, Lake St. Clair, Ontario. Results showed that the roundness increased upslope, as did the sphericity of the grains. This was especially true when the direction of the incoming swash was taken into consideration. Although no statistical analysis could be performed on the data, the evidence given by the results emphasis the distribution by shape does occur. In both the laboratory and the field the statistical analysis did indicate that the effect of the size was basically eliminated from the experiment such that the distribution was not in fact caused by the variation in size within the dedicated limits. An analysis of means comparing the means of two independent samples, the normally occurring slopes and those calculated by Sunamura 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) model, could not be performed. The figures obtained from the model could not be normalized. However, the model overpredicted the naturally occurring slopes under the field conditions that existed.

40|$|Water harvesting, {{storage and}} reutilization for crop {{production}} {{is an important}} component of research for sustainable agricultural development in the dry regions. Traditionally in southern India, water storage tanks {{are an integral part of}} villages and the water is used for recharging groundwater and irrigating fields. Over the years, the storage capacity of tanks gets reduced due to sediment deposits from erosion and runoff processes. During 2001, the Government of Andhra Pradesh undertook the ‘Neeru-Meeru’ (Water and You) initiative in Medak district, for desiltation of tanks during the dry season. We assessed the viability of desilting operations and economic value of potential utilization of sediments desilted from tanks for its nutrient value. The sediment samples collected from 21 tanks spread out in 11 mandals of the Medak district were analyzed for their plant nutrient content and microbiological properties. On an average, the sediment samples contained 720 mg nitrogen (N) and 320 mg phosphorus (P) per kg of sediment. The organic carbon (C) content of sediment varied from 5. 3 g kg- 1 to 27. 2 g kg- 1, with a mean value of 10. 7 g C kg- 1 of sediment. The application of 48, 777 tons of sediments to agricultural lands returned 520 tons of C to fields, thereby enhancing the nutrient availability for crop production. The microbiological assays indicated that the sediment samples had higher counts of bacteria (20 - 30 × 104 colony forming units [CFU] g- 1 of sediment) and actinomycetes followed by fungi. The benefit-cost (B/C) ratio of desilting operation and its utilization as plant nutrient source of N and P varied from 0. 62 to 3. 44 with an average ratio of 1. 17. This suggests economic feasibility for the application of <b>tank</b> <b>sediment</b> to agricultural fields for crop production in addition to increased water storage capacity, groundwater recharge and availability of more irrigation water. The data obtained from 21 tanks was used for extrapolating results to the entire district in which a total of 78 tanks were desilted. The approach used for extrapolation utilized the N and P composition of sediments from the nearest available sediment value to compute for rest of the tanks in the district. The overall mean N, P and organic C content in the sediments was calculated to be 730 mg kg- 1 sediment, 357 mg kg- 1 sediment and 11. 64 g C kg- 1 sediment respectively. In the district, a total of 246831 tons of sediments from 78 tanks were desilted and addition of these sediments back to farms would return 183 tons of N, 86 tons of P and 2873 tons of organic carbon. On an average, the B/C ratio for desilting operations from water tanks based on the economic plant nutrient value (N and P content) of the district was calculated to be 1. 23 which reflects a positive benefit for the cost incurred in the ‘Neeru-Meeru’ program. ...|$|E

In order to increase the rainwater storage capacity, removal of <b>sediments</b> from water <b>tanks</b> was taken up under the State Government Water Conservation Programme in Medak District, Andhra Pradesh, India. The feasibility of desilting operations and returning such huge amounts of sediments to agricultural fields was assessed by determining the sediment quality in terms of nutrients, organic carbon (C), biological properties and their economic value as a source of plant nutrients. Analysis of sediment samples showed an average of 720 mg nitrogen (N), 320 mg phosphorus (P), 310 mg potassium (K) and 9. 1 g of organic C per kg of sediment. Higher microbial populations were found in the sediments that recorded high nutrient and organic C contents. The microbial biomass C in the sediments recorded an average value of 308 mg kg– 1 sediment and the average proportion of microbial biomass C to organic C was 3. 8 %. Application of 48, 777 t of <b>sediment</b> from 21 <b>tanks</b> returned 34 t of N, 15 t of P, 15 t of K and 433 t of organic C to agricultural lands.

This study showed that there is an existing microbial regrowth problem in Lebanon drinking water that is more pronounced in the house - hold water storage tanks in the summer where the temperature is high. Furthermore, this study indicated a significant increase in the bacterial numbers upon storage for 4 and 7 days with no significant difference between bacterial numbers at 4 and 7 days. This bacterial number was found to be high in the polyethylene tank than in the cast iron <b>tank.</b> The <b>sediments</b> dry weight (mg) was calculated and found to be higher in the polyethylene tank than in the cast iron tank; this in tum attributes to a higher bacterial number in the polyethylene <b>tank</b> since <b>sediments</b> provide nutrients for bacteria to flourish grow and multiply.

The biofilm growth was found to be independent of the temperature and the availability of nutrients, as such increasing the public health concern. Pseudomollas VlJsiCliiaris was found to be dominant in the sediments and the different levels of drinking water in the house - hold water storage tanks experimental setups, whereas in the biofilm experimental setup Psetldomollas citrrJIlel/olis was found to be dominant; the gram-positive bacteria in the biofilm experimental setup occurred at a higher percentage compared to that in the sediments and water experimental setups with the prevalent dominance of Rhodococc/IJ spp. Little difference was observed between the types of microorganisms found in the source, sediments, water and the biofilm experimental set ups performed in this study.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of resuspending lake sediment for different time periods in a lab-scale tank under both oxic and anoxic conditions on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and other related sediment properties. This lab-scale study was conducted as a first step to determine if a proposed method for reducing SOD by treating sediments in lakes and reservoirs is feasible. SOD is a critical process responsible for the formation of anoxic hypolimnia in lakes and reservoirs. A reduction in SOD may delay or eliminate the onset of anoxia in the hypolimnia, preventing adverse ecosystem effects and improving water quality and ecosystem function. The proposed treatment method for lakes and reservoirs would resuspend sediment into the water column and mix the suspension under aerated conditions such that near saturated DO conditions are maintained during mixing. The sediment is resuspended such that it is fully exposed to dissolved oxygen, thereby allowing oxygen-mediated chemical and biological reactions to proceed more rapidly without being rate-limited by oxygen availability as occurs within intact sediment. By maximizing oxygen uptake rates of sediment processes over a period of time, the oxygen consuming processes responsible for SOD may be partially quenched, thereby reducing SOD once the treated sediment has resettled. Current methods for oxygenation of sediments rely on oxygenation of overlying water such that oxygen diffuses into sediment. This process is typically conducted over a period of years. The method proposed may have economic benefits when compared to hypolimnetic water oxygenation treatments if the increased operating cost of rapid treatment is offset by a shorter overall required treatment time. The first step for testing the rapid method was done in a laboratory to determine if SOD is reduced due to the treatment and if oxygenation of sediments results in a greater decrease in SOD than resuspension without oxygenation. Bottom sediments were collected from a local eutrophic reservoir, split into two samples, and then placed into 284 liter aquarium <b>tanks.</b> <b>Sediment</b> samples were resuspended for 3 hours, allowed to settle, resuspended for an additional 24 hours, allowed to settle, then resuspended for an additional 120 hours before being allowed to settle again. SOD, organic matter content, and sediment and water chemistry parameters were measured before and after each treatment period. Initial SOD in the lab experiments was greater than that measured in the lake. SOD was reduced an average of 32 % {{over the course of the}} experiment, with no significant benefit from oxygenation during resuspension. Organic matter and other sediment quality parameters remained unchanged throughout the treatment. The concentration of all water quality parameters with the exception of Mn increased in the water column over the course of the treatment. Overall, the rapid oxygenation treatment method explored in this study did not appear to be an economically feasible alternative to existing long-term treatment methods of hypolimnetic oxygenation, but resuspension of sediments without oxygenation may have potential as a reservoir sediment remediation technique. However, due to the high degree of experimental error in this data, further studies must be conducted to determine if SOD reduction can be repeated under more closely controlled conditions. Further studies are also required to investigate the economic feasibility, potential benefits, and potential negative impacts of the resuspension treatment method...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} treatment efficiency, ecological value and cost-effectiveness of two Scottish Constructed Farm Wetlands (CFW 1 & 2) receiving runoff from farmyards, fields, roofs, tracks and septic <b>tanks.</b> Water and <b>sediment</b> quality, vegetation and aquatic macroinvertebrates have been monitored since 2006. CFW 1 receives low pollutant loadings and releases water close to river standards, except for nitrate and faecal indicators. It hosts a diverse {{flora and fauna}} due to its habitat heterogeneity and low contamination. CFW 2 achieves concentration reductions for all studied pollutants, but outflow concentrations during storm events are much higher than river water quality targets. Its ecological value is poor due to its high pollution and low habitat heterogeneity. To consistently achieve water quality targets, CFWs should comprise a sedimentation pond and several cells, large enough and fully vegetated to provide sufficient residence time and enhance treatment. Sustainable CFWs represent a significant investment for farmers, hence support schemes are recommended to promote their adoption...|$|R
5000|$|The Sheoak Hill Tank as it {{was also}} known, was {{constructed}} prior to the allocation of the blocks to the new settlers, which began 27 January 1909. The materials for the dam were carted to the site by camel team. The tank {{was built on the}} northwest side of the hill. A large hole was dug for it, and much of the stone removed from the hole was used {{in the construction of the}} water run pathways and walls, as well as for the thick walls of the tank. Water is channeled down the slope into a [...] cement-lined <b>sediment</b> collection <b>tank,</b> and then into the tank, which is also lined with cement and mostly underground. If the tank filled up, the overflow was channeled out a side passage from the <b>sediment</b> <b>tank.</b> The tank was completed with a corrugated iron roof, and a steel ladder for the residents to access the water. It measures approximately 12 m in diameter, and is 6 m deep, giving it a capacity of 678,000 L.|$|R
40|$|Fish {{behavior}} can be altered by contaminants. There is an extensive literature on laboratory behavioral assays, with many chemicals impairing feeding or predator avoidance. However, there is not extensive work on fishes that live in contaminated environments. Therefore, we then review our recent research on feeding and trophic relations of populations from contaminated estuaries compared with relatively unpolluted sites. The mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, is a non-migratory fish; those from more contaminated areas are poor predators and slower to capture active prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio). In the field, they consume much detritus and sediment, which is not nutritious. They are less active than fish from cleaner sites and more vulnerable to predation. They have altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels, which may underlie altered behaviors. Fish from the reference site kept in <b>tanks</b> with <b>sediment</b> and food from the polluted site showed bioaccumulation and reduced prey capture after two months, although fish from the polluted site did not show significant improvement when maintained in a clean environment. Poor nutrition and predator avoidance {{may be responsible for}} their being smaller and having a shorter life span than reference fish. Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix, are a marine species in which the young-of-the-year spend their first summer in estuaries. We found bioaccumulation of contaminants and reduced activity, schooling, and feeding in young-of-the-year bluefish from a relatively unpolluted site that were fed prey fish from a contaminated site. They also had altered thyroid glands and neurotransmitter levels. Many field-caught specimens had empty stomachs, which is rare in this species. In the fall, when they migrate back out to the ocean, they are smaller, slower, and more likely to starve or to be eaten than those that spent their summer in cleaner estuaries [Current Zoology 58 (1) : 9 - 20, 2012]...|$|R
40|$|The Hayes Coastal Engineering Laboratory {{is a new}} {{laboratory}} {{with two}} water basins: a 45. 72 -meters long, 3. 66 meters wide and 3. 06 meters deep Tow <b>Tank</b> with <b>sediment</b> pit for dredging and current flow studies, and a 36. 58 meters long, 22. 86 meters wide and 1. 22 meters deep 3 D Wave Basin for coastal wave studies. In order to assess {{the capabilities of the}} lab a series of tests were done in both tanks. Hydrodynamic tests in the Tow Tank using a Micro Acoustic Doppler Velociometer measured current flow in the tank and assessed the efficacy of different filters to stabilize flow patterns. A concrete dam structure installed near the reversed diffusers most effectively stabilized flow of all the configurations tested. Wave tests were conducted in the 3 D Wave Basin with the newly-installed 48 paddle Rexroth wave generator at 0. 5 and 1. 0 meter water depths using wired and wireless capacitance wave gauges. These tests measured characteristics of the generated waves and reflection from the rubble-mound beach. In addition, initial testing of the Active Reflection Absorber (ARA) system was done. Correlating the wave data to the theoretical wave being produced showed that with water depth of 0. 5 meters the 0. 1 meter waves were well-formed, but the 0. 2 meter waves showed energy loss and lower correlation. The results from one meter water depth wave tests showed good formation of 0. 2 meter waves. In nearly all wave tests with pool buoys installed the waves were better formed with good correlation and a better fitting power spectrum. The beach reflection was within the expected value range, being ten percent and below for most tests. ARA, while operational, needs to be further tuned to find the settings that will increase its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Emergent {{technologies}} such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and bistatic sonars offer immense leverage to the modern applications of underwater acoustics. However, high-frequency scattering processes need to be better understood, especially in complex, multiple-target environments (e. g. dumpsites or highly cluttered seabeds). Sea trials are paramount in providing acoustic measurements to validate scattering models and show the different processes involved, but they are expensive, difficult to conduct, and fraught with difficulties. Laboratory experiments are complementary, because of the fully controlled environment and the repeatability of the measurements. The imaging frequencies (> 10 kHz) to be investigated, and the finite dimensions of the tanks usually employed, mean that these experiments need to be scaled. Our article will first present the differences between sea trials and tank experiments, the various parameters {{that need to be}} scaled, and the physical validity of the choices made in each case. We shall then illustrate this by presenting some scaled experiments conducted in our facilities at the University of Bath, in a large water <b>tank</b> containing several <b>sediment</b> trays representative of continental margin seabeds. The first series of scaled experiments correspond to acoustic propagation and penetration in th...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{characteristics}} of englacial and subglacial drainage systems in Gulkana Glacier, Alaska, were examined by analysing temporal variations of discharge and sediment load in the proglacial Phelan Creek in 2001. From data plots on semi-log paper, it appeared appropriate to separate both discharge and sediment load into fast and slow components. The two components were possibly produced by two different drainage systems: an englacial and subglacial, “channellized” {{system in the}} ablation zone, and a subglacial, “distributed” system in the accumulation zone. The data indicate the occurrence of an event during which part of the “distributed” drainage system changed into the “channellized” drainage system. The daily time-series of discharge and sediment load were represented using a tank model. In the model, the drainage from an additional tank was added, supposing that a subglacial reservoir full of water and sediment collapsed slowly when the subglacial drainage system changed from distributed to channellized. The simulation with the collapsed tank gave much more reasonable results than those with no collapsed tank. The contribution of the collapsed <b>tank</b> to total <b>sediment</b> load is 24 %, which is much larger than 9 % to total discharge. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) process {{has become one}} of the novel technologies to enhance the performance of biological treatment of wastewater. Membrane bioreactor process uses {{the membrane}} unit to replace a <b>sediment</b> <b>tank,</b> and this can greatly enhance treatment performance. However, membrane fouling in MBR restricts its widespread application because it leads to permeate flux decline, making more frequent membrane cleaning and replacement necessary, which then increases operating and maintenance costs. This study investigated the sludge characteristics in membrane fouling under sub- critical flux operation and also assessed the effect of shear stress on membrane fouling. Membrane fouling was slow under sub- critical flux operation. However, as filamentous microbes became dominant in the reactor, membrane fouling increased dramatically due to the increased viscosity and polysaccharides. A close link was found between membrane fouling and the amount of polysaccharides in soluble EPS. The predominant resistance was the cake resistance which could be minimized by increasing the shear stress. However, the resistance of colloids and solutes was not apparently reduced by increasing shear stress. Therefore, smaller particles such as macromolecules (e. g. polysaccharides) may play an important role in membrane fouling under sub- critical flux operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the Tank Farm Vadose Zone Project, led by CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc., is to define risks from past and future single-shell tank farm {{activities}} at Hanford. To meet this goal, CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. tasked scientists from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to perform detailed analyses on vadose zone sediments from within Waste Management Area (WMA) C. This report {{is the first of}} two reports written to present the results of these analyses. Specifically, this report contains all the geologic, geochemical, and selected physical characterization data collected on vadose zone sediment recovered from borehole C 4297, installed adjacent to Tank C- 105, and from borehole 299 -E 27 - 22, installed directly north of the C <b>Tank</b> Farm. <b>Sediments</b> from borehole 299 -E 27 - 22 were considered to be background uncontaminated sediments against which to compare contaminated sediments for the C Tank Farm characterization effort. This report also presents our interpretation of the data in the context of sediment types, the vertical extent of contamination, the migration potential of the contaminants, and the likely source of the contamination in the vadose zone and groundwater below the C Tank Farm. The information presented in this report supports the A-AX, C and U Waste Management Area field investigation report(a) in preparation by CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. A core log was generated for both boreholes and a geologic evaluation of all core samples was performed at the time of opening. Aliquots of sediment from the borehole core samples were analyzed and characterized in the laboratory for the following parameters: moisture content, gamma-emitting radionuclides, one-to-one water extracts (which provide soil pH, electrical conductivity, cation, trace metal, and anion data), total carbon and inorganic carbon content, and 8 M nitric acid extracts (which provide a measure of the total leachable sediment content of contaminants). Two key radiocontaminants, technetium- 99 and uranium- 238, along with other trace metals were determined in acid and water extracts by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry...|$|R
