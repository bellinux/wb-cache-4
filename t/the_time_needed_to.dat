5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals is to reduce <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, {{to two or three}} days.|$|E

5|$|The braking a is from {{an initial}} speed u {{to a final}} speed v, over a length of time t. The {{equation}} u - v = at implies that the greater the acceleration the shorter <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> change speed. The stopping distance s is also shortest when acceleration a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not be spared <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E
5|$|US113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware {{state line}} in three {{sections}} starting in 1998. The first section was constructed {{on a new}} alignment from north of MD818 to south of MD589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD90 interchange 24 {{years after it was}} partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US113 reconstruction, from south of MD589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.|$|E

5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
