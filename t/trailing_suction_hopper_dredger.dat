50|$|The deepest {{section of}} the Fehmarn Belt Trench is 35 metres and the tunnel {{sections}} will be about 10 metres high, thus the dredging barges {{will need to be}} capable of reaching depths of over 45 metres. Dredging will produce a trench some 40-50 m wide and 12-15 m deep. These parameters give a total of some 20 million cubic metres of soils to be dredged. Conventional dredging equipment can only reach to a depth of about 25 m. To excavate the middle portion of the Fehmarn trench - deeper than 25 m below the water's surface - will likely require grab <b>dredgers</b> and <b>trailing</b> <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredgers.</b>|$|R

On the other hand, the extracted sediments are used for coast protection (sand replenishments) and other marine constructions such as offshore windmills...|$|R
50|$|The vessel {{should always}} have a {{positive}} speed over the ground. It is possible to regulate {{the density of the}} sucked substance. If the head is lowered, more material will be sucked but there is a greater possibility of damaging the installation because the material can get stuck inside the pipes. Once the mixture is loaded inside the hopper, the substance will sink and the water is discharged overboard, creating more room for extra substance. A <b>trailing</b> <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredger</b> is only capable to suck relatively loose substance because the steel teeth are not so big. Harder substances such as rock, or ironbased rock must be destroyed by a cutter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trailing</b> <b>Suction</b> <b>Hopper</b> <b>Dredgers</b> release {{excess water}} with a varying flow rate and with {{variable}} fine sediment content. In the recent past, the near-field dispersion of overflow dredging plumes was determined using simple integral solutions or Lagrangian models of the buoyant jet in cross flow. In reality, these negatively-buoyant sediment plumes are interacting with the flow around the hull of the vessel, air bubbles and the propellers. If these interactions are not taken into account for the near-field modelling, the source terms for far-field simulations of {{the environmental impact of}} turbidity are inaccurate. By consequence, the predictions of the environmental impact of the generated turbidity might not be accurate enough to avoid adverse effects later on in the project phase. In a CFD analysis, it is investigated how these complex interactions take place and how they can be included in near-field dredging plume simulations. The CFD analysis reveals that the simple models can be relatively accurate in some cases, but that large deviations exist for most real-life situations. status: publishe...|$|R
