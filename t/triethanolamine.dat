25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and <b>triethanolamine</b> are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield. Ethanolamine is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and <b>triethanolamine.</b>|$|E

The thiol was coupled with 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene {{to create a}} free alkyne. The resulting product, 3,5-(4’-thiolacetyl-1’-butynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl)-benzene, had its trimethylsilyl group removed using tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and AcOH/Ac2O in THF. The free alkyne was then coupled with the upper body product from the earlier synthesis. This resulted in a NanoKid with protected thiol feet.|$|E

2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and <b>triethanolamine</b> are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E

A temperature dependence study on the corrosion rates revealed that these inhibitors enhance the activation energy. The anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes were not found to be affected; this suggests that these inhibitors do not alter the rate determining step of either anodic or cathodic reactions. The adsorption of these amines, offering inhibition, has been discussed in terms of Langmuir isotherm. A detailed investigation on this is presented in this pape...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, some {{methods of}} {{improving}} the product distribution from chemical processes are compared. The first two parts contain an experimental investigation of how the product distribution of a process {{is influenced by the}} choice of catalyst. The ability of different forms of zeolites, such as 13 X, 4 A, Y and AWSOO, to catalyze the formation of mono-, di- and <b>triethanolamines</b> from ethylene oxide and ammonia in the liquid phase has been examined and compared with that of an organic ion-exchange resin. The ion-exchange resin, Amberlite 200, gives the highest yield of monoethanolamine (MEA), while the zeolite 13 X has the highest capacity of producing MEA. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that any contributions from homogeneous reactions to the total reaction rate are negligible. A fast and highly reproducible method for the direct GC analysis of ethanolamines using fused-silica capillary columns is also presented. The third part of the thesis examines a more unusual method of changing the product distribution, the so-called periodic operation. Periodic operation means that {{one or more of the}} control variables, such as inlet concentrations or temperature, are intentionally varied with time in a periodic manner. By expanding the treatment of two well-known theoretical examples it is in one case shown that there exist price relations which can make periodic operation worthwhile. In another case it is illustrated how the comparison of periodic operation with steady-state operation is influenced by the restrictions under which the comparison is made. A number of experimental investigations given in the literature claim positive influence of periodic operation on selectivity or yield. It is shown that only a handful of these papers survive a critical examination of how the comparison with steady-state operation has been made. Even these, however, are not complete. What often remains is to cover a larger field of operating conditions. For the reaction system studied in the first two parts, no influence of periodic operation on yield could be detected...|$|R

50|$|<b>Triethanolamine</b> is used {{primarily}} in making surfactants, such as for emulsifier. It {{is a common}} ingredient in formulations used for both industrial and consumer products. The <b>triethanolamine</b> neutralizes fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and solubilizes oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water. Triethanolammonium salts in some cases are more soluble than salts of alkali metals that might be used otherwise, and results in less alkaline products than would from using alkali metal hydroxides to form the salt.

It {{also serves as a}} pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from cleansing creams and milks, skin lotions, eye gels, moisturizers, shampoos, shaving foams, and so on. TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5−6.0. Cleansing milk-cream emulsions based on TEA are particularly good at removing makeup. (HOCH2)3N was used in the synthesis of amustaline.|$|E
