5|$|Despite vast {{differences}} in appearance and morphology, A.vulgare {{is related to}} such varied taxa as the gilled fungi of Lentinus, the poroid genus Albatrellus, the coral-like Clavicorona, and fellow tooth fungus Hericium. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> all of these taxa—members of the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales—has been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics.|$|E

50|$|Although {{it appears}} like trading <b>relationships</b> {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> production, Marx argues that in aggregate (in an overall sense) {{it is just}} the other way round: <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct production process (the mode <b>of</b> production) determine <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>of</b> exchange. This justifies the initial analysis of production in abstraction from all kinds of price fluctuations.|$|R

5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used in physical challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E
5|$|Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries {{focused on}} Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign {{and the events}} surrounding <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> the Duc d'Épernon and Henry III of France, and between the Duke of Buckingham and Charles I. In {{the first half of}} the 19th century, popular historians such as Charles Dickens and Charles Knight popularised Edward's life with the Victorian public, focusing on the King's relationship with his favourites and, increasingly, alluding to his possible homosexuality. From the 1870s onwards, however, open academic discussion of Edward's sexuality was circumscribed by changing English values. By the start of the 20th century, English schools were being advised by the government to avoid overt discussion of Edward's personal relationships in history lessons. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> these to living groups and to each other is controversial.

5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (<b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
