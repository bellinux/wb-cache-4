5|$|The Smoking Gunns defended their WWF Tag Team Championship in {{the next}} match against Owen Hart and his mystery partner, who was {{revealed}} to be Yokozuna.

5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Hulk Hogan {{defended his}} title against Yokozuna. Yokozuna {{controlled}} {{the beginning of}} the match until he ran at Hogan in the corner but missed an avalanche splash. Hogan tried twice to body slam Yokozuna but could not pick him up. Yokozuna performed a bear hug on Hogan and tried to pin him after executing a belly <b>to</b> <b>belly</b> suplex. Hogan kicked Yokozuna in the face three times and knocked him down to the mat. He performed a leg drop, his signature move, on Yokozuna but was unable to pin him. As Hogan prepared to attempt to body slam Yokozuna, manager Harvey Wippleman, disguised as a planted photographer, jumped up onto the edge of the ring. His camera exploded in Hogan's face, which allowed Yokozuna to knock Hogan down and perform a leg drop. Yokozuna pinned Hogan to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Banzai drop on Hogan after the match.|$|E
5|$|The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger {{challenged}} Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect {{was revealed}} to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After getting back into the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from {{a corner of the}} ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly <b>to</b> <b>belly</b> suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel.|$|E

25|$|Many Allied fighter gun cameras often {{revealed}} that aircraft {{which had been}} claimed destroyed as '109's were often Arado Ar 96 trainers with a cadet pilot at the controls. To counter this non-combat flights were only {{to be carried out}} at dawn and dusk. The Luftwaffe expanded aircraft warning systems and devised radio signals to warn flights of intruders. If attacked, poorly armed aircraft were to dive down to tree-top level, and if necessary, the pilot was <b>to</b> <b>belly</b> land and take cover, as pilots were far more important than aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between Rick Steiner and Mike Rotunda for the NWA World Television Championship. Kevin Sullivan, who {{accompanied}} Rotunda, was locked inside a cage.

25|$|The first {{match was}} between Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) (accompanied by Woman and Nitron) and The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott). The Steiners had the early {{advantage}} over Doom until Scott missed a clothesline, and sent himself outside the ring, where Nitron attacked him. Doom {{had the advantage}} until Scott fought back, and performed a belly <b>to</b> <b>belly</b> suplex. Rick and Simmons tagged in, and Rick had the advantage until Nitron pulled Rick outside the ring. Rick performed a clothesline to Nitron, and both teams fought outside. Rick returned to the ring in time for Simmons to be counted out, and the Steiner Brothers won the match.|$|E
25|$|Next, Kurt Angle fought Kane. During the match, Angle {{executed}} Kane's signature flying clothesline. Confidently, Angle tried another, but Kane {{countered with}} a clothesline of his own. Later on, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver, but Angle grabbed Kane's mask, distracting him enough for Angle to execute an Angle Slam. Angle applied the ankle lock on Kane, which was stopped when Kane reached the ropes. With Angle {{still holding the}} foot, Kane used the other foot to perform an enzuigiri. A top rope attack by Kane was prevented when Angle rushed to the corner and executed a belly <b>to</b> <b>belly</b> suplex on him. Kane tried a chokeslam but Angle reversed it into a roll-up using the ropes to win the match.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} a {{two out of}} three falls match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. In the midst of the action, Jericho {{attempted}} a Lionsault, which Benoit countered into a Crippler Crossface, forcing Jericho to submit and winning the first fall. After the first fall, Benoit retained the advantage, but after he delivered two Belly <b>to</b> <b>Belly</b> suplexes, Jericho countered a third one into the Walls of Jericho, forcing Benoit to submit and allowing Jericho to win his first fall (the second fall in the match). As Benoit and Jericho fought back and forth, Benoit countered a Cradle by Jericho into one of his own, and he pinned Jericho by holding on to the ring ropes for leverage to win his second fall (the third fall overall) and the match.|$|E
