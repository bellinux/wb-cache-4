5|$|The Luftwaffe cowed the defenders, {{breaking}} them psychologically.

Her romantic feelings towards Sonic are kept intact, with a notable change being that she actively keeps her crush on him a secret, even from Sonic himself.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs. Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and these ships formed <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> the Italian cruiser force.|$|E

5|$|The YB-17s {{quickly became}} {{obsolete}} and were transferred in October 1940 to the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, California, when the 2d BG acquired newer models. During World War II they operated again at Langley Field until mid-1942. The Air Corps belatedly put the B-17 into mass production beginning in July 1940, {{but at the}} time of the attack on Pearl Harbor still had only 198 in service. However, 12,000 were produced during the war, became <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> the air war against Germany, and were an iconic symbol of the AAF.|$|E
5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters {{was in the}} microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic satellite television systems. An emerging application is in superconducting filters {{for use in the}} cellular base stations operated by mobile phone companies.|$|E
5|$|Under Ferguson's guidance, {{the club}} won three league championships, four Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winner's Cup, the European Super Cup, a League Cup, and a Drybrough Cup—all {{in the space}} of seven years. Players such as Jim Leighton, Willie Miller, Alex McLeish and Gordon Strachan became <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> the team. Aberdeen's second League title was won in 1979–80, and this initial success was built on, with Scottish Cup wins in three {{successive}} seasons from 1982 to 1984, and two more league titles in 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> RAF Fighter Command, and saw {{action in the}} European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce <b>the</b> <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> his team.

By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement as a player, and applied to management positions at York City and Notts County, and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
