40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The use of {{operative}} {{environmental temperature}} (Te) {{has been a}} major advance in the study of thermal ecology. I review the use of operative temperature in thermal biology with an emphasis on insects. Then I use data from dragonflies in Interior Alaska (Odonata: Anisoptera) to compare the efficacy of operative and ambient temperature when examining thermoregulating ability. I conclude that although the use of Te may provide more accurate measures of thermoregulation under specific environmental conditions, the use of ambient temperature usually leads to the same conclusions about thermoregulating ability. I next examine the relationships between thermoregulating ability, minimum flight temperature (MFT), mass, passive cooling rate, and wing loading for the ten species of dragonflies present in Interior Alaska investigate the influence of ambient temperature and solar radiation on daily and seasonal activity patterns. I find a range of thermoregulating abilities from complete thermoconformers to very efficient periodic <b>thermoregulators.</b> The ability to thermoregulate is strongly tied to body mass. Thermoconfomers have significantly lower MFTs than <b>thermoregulators,</b> suggesting a possible tradeoff between the ability to operate and low and high thoracic temperatures...|$|R

The expression of virulence factor is optimal at 39°C, and {{is controlled by}} a transcriptional activator, PrfA, whose expression is thermoregulated by the PrfA <b>thermoregulator</b> UTR element.

50|$|Listeriolysin O is encoded by {{the gene}} hly, {{which is part}} of a {{pathogenicity}} island called LIPI-1.

Since 37 °C is within the range of normal body temperature, PrfA protein, as well as listeriolysin O and other virulence factors regulated by PrfA, is only produced when L. monocytogenes is in a host.|$|E

40|$|Springhare are large, bipedal, nocturnal, herbivorous, {{burrowing}} rodents {{that are}} found in arid and semi-arid parts of southern and eastern Africa. In this thesis I examine the general ecology, biology and physiology of these animals in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. An investigation of their distribution and activity in the study site showed that springhare exhibit a preference for flat, open, recently disturbed habitat that {{is dominated by the}} grass Cynodon dactylon and the sedge Cyperus esculentus. These two species constitute a major proportion of their diet. The impact of spring hare on chicory and grazing is also discussed. Nightly activity generally peaks soon after dark and decreases in the 2 - 4 hour period before sunrise. This pattern is, however, modified by moonlight. Springhare typically respond to moonlight by reducing aboveground activity, shifting their activity to dark moonless periods of the night, and by reducing their use of open space. Contrary to earlier reports, springhare utilise several different burrow systems spread over large areas. They regularly change burrow systems and seldom spend more than a few consecutive days in each. Springhare do not appear to defend territories but recently used burrows appear to be avoided by conspecifics. Males and females on average use a similar number of burrows, scattered over similar sized areas. Burrows are shown to provide a stable microclimate of moderate temperature and high humidity throughout the year. Reproduction is continuous and there is no synchronised breeding season. The ability to reproduce throughout the year is attributed primarily to their ability to utilise subterranean food stores. The overall reproductive strategy of springhare (a single young with long gestation and weaning) is unusual for a mammal of this size but may be linked to low levels of adult and juvenile mortality. Physiologically, springhare are reasonably well adapted to life in hot, arid environments. They produce a concentrated urine, exhibit a high tolerance to dehydration, are good osmoregulators capable of maintaining plasma volume, osmolality and ion balance over long periods of water deprivation, and are able to produce dry faeces.

40|$|Behavioral thermoregulators {{leverage}} {{environmental temperature}} {{to control their}} body temperature. Habitat thermal quality therefore dictates the difficulty and necessity of precise thermoregulation, {{and the quality of}} behavioral thermoregulation in turn impacts organism fitness via the thermal dependence of performance. Comparing the body temperature of a <b>thermoregulator</b> with a null (non-thermoregulating) model allows us to estimate habitat thermal quality and the effect of behavioral thermoregulation on body temperature. We define a null model for behavioral thermoregulation that is a random walk in a temporally and spatially explicit thermal landscape. Predicted body temperature is also integrated through time, so recent body temperature history, environmental temperature, and movement influence current body temperature; there is no particular reliance on an organism's equilibrium temperature. We develop a metric called thermal benefit that equates body temperature to thermally dependent performance as a proxy for fitness. We measure thermal quality of two distinct tropical habitats as a temporally dynamic distribution that is an ergodic property of many random walks, and we compare it with the thermal benefit of real lizards in both habitats. Our simple model focuses on transient body temperature; as such, using it we observe such subtleties as shifts in the thermoregulatory effort and investment of lizards throughout the day, from thermoregulators to thermoconformers...|$|E
40|$|Odonate {{species are}} {{classified}} {{in terms of}} their thermoregulatory behavior into flier and percher categories.

In this paper, an analysis of the behavioral temporal budget of an odonate neotropical assemblage was performed to determine the role of body size on territorial defense and general behavioral strategies. This analysis revealed three groups based on time budget. The first and second groups contained the species that remained perched for most of the activity time, but species of the first group differ from the second group by the larger proportion of transition flights. The third group contained species which were usually observed patrolling or in reproductive activities. The larger species spent more time in patrol and territorial defense activities, while smaller species remained perched. Larger dragonflies, with better thermoregulatory abilities could spend more time in reproductive activities. The behavioral classification of fliers and perchers is considered extremely useful but could oversimplify the behavioral patterns among species that have a wide body size variation. It is proposed that a behavioral continuum associated with the body size variation in perchers could explain some patterns of species interactions in odonate communities...|$|R

The molecular chaperone HSP 90 is a key component that contributes to survival in the abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the survival of B. xylophilus and the functionality of the HSP 90 gene. Bx-HSP 90 was cloned from a suppression subtractive hybridization library. In situ mRNA hybridization showed that Bx-HSP 90 was constitutively expressed in response to all of the temperatures tested, and RT-PCR indicated that all of the temperatures could induce Bx-HSP 90 transcription, with the highest transcript level detected at 30 °C. The suppression of the Bx-HSP 90 transcript by RNA interference led to a 25 % reduction in the number of nematodes at 30 °C after 44 h. Sharp declines in the survival of the RNAi-treated nematodes were observed after 8 days at 25 °C, 48 h at 30 °C and 24 h at 35 °C.

During the exercise-in-heat protocol, rectal temperature (T[subscript]re) skin temperatures (T[subscript]sk), heart rate (HR), V[subscript]O 2, V[subscript]CO 2, Vsubscript]E, RER, sweat rate, and the number of heat activated sweat glands (HASG) were determined. Despite highest and lowest end-exposure T[subscript]re in the Y and O groups, respectively, the rise in rectal temperature (accounting for differences in baseline T[subscript]re) was similar in all age groups. Changes in body heat storage (Delta S), both absolute and relative to body mass, were highest in the Y and O groups and lowest in the PP group. While end-session as well as changes inmean skin temperature were similar in all three age groups, HR (absolute and percentage of maximum) was significantly lower for the O compared with the PP and Y groups. Total body as well as per body surface sweating rate was significantly lower for the PP group, while body mass-related net metabolic heat production ((M - W) kg [superscript]- 1) and heat gained from the environment were highest in the PP and lowest in the O group. Since mass-related evaporative cooling (E[subscript]sk kg [superscript]- 1) and sweating efficiency (E[subscript]sk/M[subscript]sw kg[superscript]- 1) were highest in the PP and lowest in the O group, the mass-dependent heat stored in the body (Delta S kg[superscript]- 1) was lowest in the PP (1. 87 ± 0. 03 W kg[superscript]- 1) and highest in Y and O groups (2. 19 ± 0. 08 and 1. 97 ± 0. 11 W kg [superscript]- 1, respectively). Furthermore, it was calculated that while the O group required only 4. 1 ± 0. 5 W of heat energy to raise their body core temperature by 1 ºC, and the Y group needed 6. 9 ± 0. 9 W(1 º C) [superscript]- 1, the PP group required as much as 12. 3 ± 0. 7 W to heat up their body core temperature by 1 ºC. These results suggest that in conditions similar to those imposed during this study, age and age-related characteristics affect the overall rate of heat gain as well as the mechanisms through which this heat is being dissipated. While prepubertal boys seem to be the most efficient <b>thermoregulators,</b> the elderly subjects appear to be the least efficient <b>thermoregulators...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceEscape {{tactics and}} optimal refuge use have {{attracted}} considerable interest, but {{the influence of}} pregnancy on escape tactics remains understudied. For instance, embryonic sensitivity to environmental conditions and maternal constraints vary dramatically across pregnancy, and these dynamics should modulate the costebenefit balance of refuge use. We experimentally studied thermoregulation and refuge use in pregnant and nonreproductive aspic vipers, Vipera aspis, {{at different stages of}} gestation (first, middle and last third). We determined preferred body temperatures (Tset) in a cost-free environment to test for fecundity and stage dependencies of maternal Tset. Then, we examined behavioural responses to repeated simulated predatory attacks. Pregnant females were extremely precise <b>thermoregulators</b> compared with nonreproductive females, and Tset was independent of litter size or gestation stage. After simulated attacks, pregnant females limited their time spent in the refuge and thereby their deviation from Tset. By contrast, nonreproductive females had a greater response to predation exposure and adjusted their response to risk level. Contrary to our predictions, pregnant females did not vary their behaviour based on gestation stage, despite increasing physical burden as pregnancy progressed. Overall, our results illustrate that pregnant females alter their behaviour to benefit their developing embryos thermally despite risk to themselves (increased exposure). By doing so, however, the female realizes a benefit by accelerating temperature-sensitive developmental time and thus reducing the duration of pregnancy and associated physical burde...|$|R
40|$|Springhares are large, nocturnally active, diurnally fossorial rodents that {{typically}} inhabit arid and semi-arid areas. This lifestyle {{means that they}} need to balance excessive heat loss when foraging at night against insufficient heat loss in a potentially warm, humid burrow and both of these against the need to minimize water turnover and energy requirements. In this study we investigated metabolism and thermoregulation in these animals. Basal metabolic rate averaged 8. 62 ± 1. 37 J g - 1 h - 1 and minimum thermal conductance 0. 386 ± 0. 062 J g - 1 h - 1 °C - 1. These were higher and lower than expected, respectively. This, along with a relatively low, lower critical temperature and broad thermal neutral zone indicate that springhares are physiologically well suited to the low night-time temperatures, which they typically encounter. Body temperatures were quite labile but springhares became hyperthermic at temperatures above 30 °C suggesting that they are poor <b>thermoregulators</b> at high temperatures. This is attributed to their seldom, if ever, encountering temperatures in this range. Insufficient heat loss under normal resting conditions {{does not appear to be}} a problem, as springhares inhabit deep burrows in which the temperature never exceeds the upper critical temperature. Excess heat generated during vigorous underground exercise is presumably stored and dissipated to the cool night air or the cooler soil when subsequently resting. Water turnover and energy expenditure are presumably adequately addressed by other physiological and behavioural characteristics...|$|R
