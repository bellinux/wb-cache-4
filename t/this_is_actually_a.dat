He returns to work, but is laid off as the chopped-off appendage was his drawing arm.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artifacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{upwelling}} {{is found}} in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.|$|E

500|$|In the painting, {{the actual}} sun is the yellow {{ball in the}} upper-right corner {{surrounded}} by the second circle. [...] The large circle taking {{up most of the}} sky is a parhelic circle, parallel to the horizon and located at the same altitude as the sun, as the painting renders it. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> common halo, although a full circle as depicted is rare. [...] Such parhelic circles are caused by horizontally oriented plate ice crystals reflecting sun rays. [...] In order for a full circle to appear sun rays must be reflected both internally and externally.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A {{and called it}} [...] "generally a terrific episode". Handlen wrote that he was [...] "delighted to get another Scully-centric episode [...] one that doesn't end up with her looking pale and deathly in a hospital bed." [...] Despite his approval of the script, he slightly criticized the series for writing Scully-centric episodes {{based solely on the}} idea that [...] "something is being done to her" [...] as opposed to against or with her. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was an interesting and uncommon in-depth look at Scully's psychology. The writers rarely had such an opportunity, and along with Gillian Anderson, they run with the opportunity. The religious metaphor is a bit thick throughout, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> bit more subtle than would become the norm. Making the child sick works for the mythology, but in a lot of ways, it seems like a plot contrivance." ...|$|E
500|$|Berhtwald {{appears to}} have been {{involved}} in the governance of the church, establishing the bishopric of Sherborne in Wessex and it was during his tenure that Sussex, the last pagan kingdom in England, was converted to Christianity. He also consecrated the first Bishop of Selsey. During his time in office, King Wihtred of Kent in the Law of Wihtred exempted the church from taxation. Berhtwald was a proponent of his predecessor's view of the archbishops of Canterbury as primates of the entire island of Britain. Berhtwald co-operated closely with Wihtred in the kingdom, and secured the exemption of the church from taxation under Wihtred's laws issued in 695. The law code also dealt with other ecclesiastical matters, including marriage, Sunday observance, and pagan worship. This law code resulted from a royal council that was held at Bearsted. Further privileges for the church were issued in 699, and may have been composed by Berhtwald before being promulgated. Another privilege, usually referred to as the [...] "Privilege of Wihtred", is claimed to be a grant from Wihtred to the monasteries of Kent of exemption from non-clerical control. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> ninth-century forgery.|$|E

2500|$|As such, many newer works, such as {{the fourth}} edition of Fishes of the World, {{classify}} lampreys in a separate group called Hyperoartia or Petromyzontida, but whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> clade is disputed. Namely, it has been proposed that the non-lamprey [...] "Hyperoartia" [...] are in fact closer to the jawed vertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the very}} first legend, Asturias claims that Guatemala was {{constructed}} over buried cities, one over the other, like a house with many floors. [...] In a figurative sense <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> true fact, as Guatemalan culture {{can be seen as}} superposed over a Mayan heritage, in the ruins of the arrival of the Spanish. [...] Indeed, even the literal interpretation contains truth, as it was directly over the ruins of Palenque and Cop√°n that the Spanish cities were raised, creating something like a stratified tower of Babel.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] "The Tale of Sir Robin", there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice over is {{described}} as [...] "the dark forest of Ewing"). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> still photograph of the Gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia.

2500|$|In 900 Julian {{years there}} are [...] = 225 leap days. The Revised Julian leap rule omits seven of nine century leap years, leaving [...] leap days per 900-year cycle. Thus the {{calendar}} mean year is 365+ days, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> double-cycle that reduces to 365+ = 365.24 days, or exactly 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 48 seconds, {{which is exactly}} 24 seconds shorter than the Gregorian mean year of 365.2425 days, so {{in the long term}} on average the Revised Julian calendar pulls ahead of the Gregorian calendar by one day in 3600 years.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{weeks after}} {{publication}} of the novel, the Boston Post newspaper published another alien invasion story, an unauthorised sequel to The War of the Worlds, which turned the tables on the invaders. Edison's Conquest of Mars was written by Garrett P. Serviss, a now little remembered writer, who described the famous inventor Thomas Edison leading a counterattack against the invaders on their home soil. Though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> sequel to 'Fighters from Mars', a revised and unauthorised reprint of The War of the Worlds, they both were first printed in the Boston Post in 1898. Lazar Lagin published [...] "Major Well Andyou" [...] in USSR in 1962, an alternative view of events in The War of the Worlds {{from the viewpoint of}} a traitor.|$|E

[...] The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily. [...] All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, {{and she has to}} serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.|$|E
