Compared to Korea, Taiwanese industries have higher producer <b>turnover,</b> <b>smaller</b> dispersion in producer productivity, a smaller percentage of plants operating at low productivity levels, and smaller productivity differentials between surviving and failing producers. These patterns are consistent with strong competitive pressures in Taiwan that lead to market selection based on productivity differences.

This question was broken into three research objectives. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with nine owner-managers and seven employees from eleven Australian small businesses. Findings of this study identify adverse consequences of turnover, uncover antecedents of voluntary <b>turnover,</b> pinpoint <b>small</b> business characteristics that enhance employee retention and present a suite of small business employee retention strategies. Implications of the findings for management practice are explained. Limitations {{of the study and}} their implications for future research are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|We use micro panel {{data for}} {{producers}} in seven two-digit manufacturing industries in South Korea and Taiwan and identify {{a number of}} systematic differences in industry structure between the countries. Our empirical findings indicate Taiwanese industries are characterised by less concentrated market structure, more producer <b>turnover,</b> <b>smaller</b> within-industry productivity dispersion across producers, a smaller percentage of plants operating at low productivity levels, and smaller productivity differentials between surviving and failing producers. These patterns are consistent with strong competitive pressures in Taiwan that lead to market selection based on productivity differences.
