Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to Hijra, while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, only <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E

2500|$|... "Adieu" [...] ("Farewell"), is a 1960s-inspired pop song, {{featuring}} a double bassline and [...] "stomping" [...] percussion in the vein of Bo Diddley. It was released as the album's first single on September 19 and topped CBC Radio 3's The R3-30 singles chart for two consecutive weeks in November. Lyrically, [...] "Adieu" [...] deals with what Martin {{describes as the}} phase of [...] "the break-up where you really just want the other person to disappear... {{you want to stop}} thinking about them", though she also clarifies that [...] "it's a general break-up song, it doesn't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> person in particular". A music video for the song, directed by Jérémie Saindon, features Niels Schneider as Martin's boyfriend whose infidelity provokes her to enact revenge on his various partners, and eventually him as well. The concept was inspired by the 1960s sitcom Bewitched and styled with touches of both retro and modern.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{among the}} heresies that are spoken {{in this matter}} is the habit of calling a grey day a [...] "colourless" [...] day. Grey is a colour, and {{can be a very}} {{powerful}} and pleasing colour. There is also an insulting style of speech about [...] "one grey day just like another" [...] You might as well <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> green tree just like another. A grey clouded sky is indeed a canopy between us and the sun; so is a green tree, if it comes to that. But the grey umbrellas differ as much as the green in their style and shape, in their tint and tilt. One day may be grey like steel, and another grey like dove's plumage. One may seem grey like the deathly frost, and another grey like the smoke of substantial kitchens. No things could seem further apart than the doubt of grey and the decision of scarlet. Yet grey and red can mingle, as they do in the morning clouds: and also in a sort of warm smoky stone of which they build the little towns in the west country. In those towns even the houses that are wholly grey have a glow in them; as if their secret firesides were such furnaces of hospitality as faintly to transfuse the walls like walls of cloud. And wandering in those westland parts I did once really find a sign-post pointing up a steep crooked path to a town that was called Clouds. I did not climb up to it; I feared that either the town would not be good enough for the name, or I should not be good enough for the town. Anyhow, the little hamlets of the warm grey stone have a geniality which is not achieved by all the artistic scarlet of the suburbs; as if it were better to warm one's hands at the ashes of Glastonbury than at the painted flames of Croydon.|$|E
60|$|By these means Rachel {{reached that}} stage in {{thinking}}, if thinking {{it can be}} called, when the eyes are intent upon a ball or a knob and the lips cease to move. Her efforts {{to come to an}} understanding had only hurt her aunt's feelings, and the conclusion must be that it is better not to try. To feel anything strongly was to create an abyss between oneself and others who feel strongly perhaps but differently. It was far better to play the piano and forget all the rest. The conclusion was very welcome. Let these odd men and women--her aunts, the Hunts, Ridley, Helen, Mr. Pepper, and the rest--be symbols,--featureless but dignified, symbols of age, of youth, of motherhood, of learning, and beautiful often as people upon the stage are beautiful. It appeared that nobody ever said a thing they meant, or ever talked of a feeling they felt, but that was what music was for. Reality dwelling in what one saw and felt, but did not <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>one</b> could accept a system in which things went round and round quite satisfactorily to other people, without often troubling to think about it, except as something superficially strange. Absorbed by her music she accepted her lot very complacently, blazing into indignation perhaps once a fortnight, and subsiding as she subsided now. Inextricably mixed in dreamy confusion, her mind seemed to enter into communion, to be delightfully expanded and combined with the spirit of the whitish boards on deck, with the spirit of the sea, with the spirit of Beethoven Op. 112, even with the spirit of poor William Cowper there at Olney. Like a ball of thistledown it kissed the sea, rose, kissed it again, and thus rising and kissing passed finally out of sight. The rising and falling of the ball of thistledown was represented by the sudden droop forward of her own head, and when it passed out of sight she was asleep.|$|E

In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year. Those who perpetrate these crimes are the lowest of the low in our society and their victims will have no stronger advocate in the Senate to help ensure they have the justice they deserve. On August 21, he issued a television commercial in which he said: Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize.

But by the time the reports emerged into the media, Tamannaah wrapped up the shoot of the song in the film on 31 March and V. V. Vinayak thanked her for accepting the offer in his Facebook page. The song, a romantic one, was shot in Hyderabad in a vineyard set for 5 days. In an interaction to Chennai Times, Tamannaah's father said [...] "The primary reason why she agreed to do this song was because it is the most important song in the film. It is not an item song but a romantic number and the director narrated how he intends to shoot it. It is true that a year ago, when the script was first written, Tamannaah had chosen {{to be a part of}} this film. However, when the script was changed, we mutually agreed to part ways. But despite that, both Tamannaah and Vinayak have mutual respect for each other and that is why, when Vinayak requested Tamannaah to do this one song for him, she agreed." [...] About his character, Brahmanandam spoke [...] "I played Dimple in this film and it is a very different character from my previous films. Prakash Raj played a dual role in this film and I played an assistant to one of his characters. But I get confused with both of them and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> with the other.

50|$|The {{idea for}} The Matt Lucas Awards stemmed from And the Winner Is..., a radio series {{presented}} by Lucas {{for a number}} of years prior to the series. The format of the series involves a number of celebrity guests providing nominations for artists or objects in a number of weird and wonderful categories, the winner of which will receive a 'Lucas' award. A pilot episode of the series was filmed in June 2011, and later released to the BBC iPlayer for internet viewing. The layout of the pilot consisted of Lucas in the centre of a studio of people, sitting on a couch, as if at an awards ceremony. Three guests would then come on, one at a time, and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> subject which they have a grievance with. The pilot received positive feedback from critics and audience alike, and as such, a full series of six episodes was commissioned by the BBC. Filming began in January 2012, with episodes airing from 10 April. Unlike the pilot, the series is set in a studio designed to look like Lucas' flat, and three guests each give a nomination in the same subject category, unlike the pilot, which was one subject per guest. Lucas' mother is also present in every episode. During the first series, musician David Arnold performed incidental music live in the studio. Each episode also features a performance section, where the guest must back up their nomination by giving a performance relating to it, such as singing, dancing or otherwise performing. Lucas performs the opening theme tune, and in the first series also sang variations on the theme live over the closing credits.Several changes took place for the second series, the most noticeable being that Lucas no longer decides the winner from each category himself, but instead the winner is chosen by a panel of judges. Also, Arnold does not appear and any incidental music is no longer performed live.|$|E
