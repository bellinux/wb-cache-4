5|$|Later, Hill {{attacked}} both Fielding and Smart, 13 August 1752, in <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> of The Impertinent to be produced. Although {{the work}} was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column in the London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.|$|E

5|$|The Freshman Issue {{is another}} {{special edition of}} the Technique. It is the first issue {{published}} each academic year and {{is by far the}} longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming Freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> in which content from previous issues is reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns {{about the safety of}} playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E
25|$|The Magyarization policy {{actually}} took shape {{as early as}} the 1830s, when Hungarian started replacing Latin and German in education. Magyarization lacked any religious, racial or otherwise exclusionary component. Language was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue.</b> The eagerness of the Hungarian government in its Magyarization efforts was comparable to that of tsarist Russification from the late 19th century.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} his late teens that {{it was pointed out}} that he would turn into an {{international}} wicket-keeper, as he was a budding fast bowler that was building up a good reputation at junior level. He was clocked at 75mph at the age of 14, although <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> was that the majority of his bowling was waist-high. He then moved onto unorthodox off-breaks, which were deemed illegal right from the start, and so he started to keep wicket for his school.|$|E
25|$|The loss {{of almost}} all of their land was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> that the Havasupai were contending with: the {{increase}} in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages. Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles. By 1906 only 166 tribal members remainedhalf the number Garces saw when he first came across the tribe in 1776.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} of The Orange Box, IGN stated that {{although}} Half-Life 2 has already been released through other mediums, the game itself is still enjoyable on a console. They {{also noted that the}} physics of Half-Life 2 are very impressive despite being a console title. However, it was noted that the graphics on the Xbox 360 version of Half-Life 2 were not as impressive as when the title was released on the PC. GameSpot's review of The Orange Box noticed that the content of both the Xbox 360 releases, and PlayStation 3 releases were exactly alike, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> with the PlayStation 3 version was that it had noticeable frame-rate hiccups. GameSpot continued to say that the frame rates issues were only minor but some consider them to be a significant irritation.|$|E

25|$|High-Low Arbitration, or Bracketed Arbitration, is an {{arbitration}} {{wherein the}} parties to the dispute agree in advance the limits within which the arbitral tribunal must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> between the party is the amount of compensation. If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures {{may or may not be}} revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.|$|E
25|$|From the 1860s onwards {{government}} in New South Wales became increasingly stable and assured. Fears of class conflict faded {{as the population}} bulge resulting from the gold rushes was accommodated on the newly available farmlands and in the rapidly growing towns. The last British troops left the colony in 1870, and law and order was maintained {{by the police and}} a locally raised militia, which had little to do apart from catching a few bushrangers. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> which really excited political passions in this period was education, which was the source of bitter conflict between Catholics, Protestants, and secularists, who all had conflicting views on how schools should be operated, funded and supervised. This was a major preoccupation for Henry Parkes, the dominant politician of the period (he was Premier five times between 1872 and 1889). In 1866 Parkes, as Education Minister, brought in a compromise Schools Act that brought all religious schools under the supervision of public boards, in exchange for state subsidies. But in 1880 the secularists won out when Parkes withdrew all state aid for church schools and established a statewide system of free secular schools.|$|E

50|$|Conflict {{resolution}} {{approaches that}} focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issues</b> are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties.|$|R
500|$|In {{the fourth}} round Arsenal faced Stoke City of the Second Division at home. They made light {{work of the}} opposition, winning by three goals and once more set a unique record: David O'Leary's strike meant all 10 regular outfield players each had scored for Arsenal during the season. In his match report for The Times, Stuart Jones assessed: [...] "Having {{experienced}} northing but victory {{since the end of}} August, Arsenal are walking around with almost too much belief," [...] and felt complacency was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> preventing the club from reaching the quarter-finals.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Science Stories ceased {{publication}} {{with its}} April 1941 issue, and the Goodmans brought out <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> of Uncanny Stories the same month. [...] Like Marvel Science Stories, it was edited by Robert O. Erisman. [...] The {{quality of the}} fiction was very poorâ€”sf historian Mike Ashley comments that Ray Cummings' lead story, [...] "Coming of the Giant Germs", was [...] "one of his most appalling stories". [...] Ashley speculates {{that the only reason}} the magazine was issued was to use up some remaining material that had been acquired for Marvel Science Stories, perhaps because at this time the Goodmans were beginning to focus much more on the growing comic-book market.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{challenges}} to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding due process and equal protection, none of which were successful. [...] Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the act, including whether knowledge of soring or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it is not. The issue of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the Circuit Court level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the Fifth Circuit Court, it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.|$|E
500|$|In issuing desired {{specifications}} {{for the design}} that would become the Nevada-class, the Navy's General Board asked for triple gun turrets, i.e. three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the Nevadas, which had five and six two-gun turretsâ€”yet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the [...] would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the South Carolinas, it was {{not even in the}} experimental stageâ€”the first turret was authorized in 1911 and would not be ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision {{to go ahead with the}} turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> came with shell interference when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by delaying the firing of the center barrel by a small fraction of a second. Moreover, there was a major benefit in weight thanks to the accompanying loss of an armored barbette and turret. These weight savings were applied to the armor protection, making the [...] "all or nothing" [...] concept a reality.|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival at}} Carabanchel, the vehicle was tested against the T-26 in {{mobility}} over different terrain types and in firepower. [...] The vehicles were graded {{based upon a}} five-point scale for each test, which would be multiplied by a coefficient of importance for each test. [...] During the testing the Verdeja traveled for some 500kilometres (300mi) without any maintenance problems, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>issue</b> being the large consumption of water by the gasoline engine, {{due to the lack}} of an efficient radiator, and the loss of a rubber liner of one of the roadwheels. [...] It was found that the maximum velocity of the Verdeja was either on par with similar vehicles in foreign service or superior, while the Verdeja proved itself capable of going over trenches almost 2m wide and climbing slopes of 40Â°. [...] In terms of armament, it was proved that the vehicle could withstand the recoil of the 45millimetre high-velocity tank gun. [...] One of the vehicle's disadvantages was that the tank commander's aiming device was designed for a 37millimetre anti-tank cannon, adapted into the Verdeja {{due to the lack of}} time to manufacture one for the 45millimetre Mark I. [...] Testing concluded with the Verdeja receiving a total of 243 points, compared to the 205 points awarded to the T-26B. [...] Testing completed, the prototype was returned and several problems were fixed, including engine deficiencies, the elevation of the sprocket and an increase to 10millimetre of armor on all areas that had less. [...] These changes made, the Verdeja returned to testing, this time scoring 261.98 points.|$|E
