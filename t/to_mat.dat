5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers <b>to</b> <b>mat,</b> leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{although}} D. discoideum generally reproduces asexually, D. discoideum {{is still}} capable of sexual reproduction if certain conditions are met. D. discoideum has three different mating types and studies have identified the sex locus that specifies these three mating types. Type I strains are specified by the gene called MatA, Type II stains have three different genes: MatB (homologous <b>to</b> <b>Mat</b> A), Mat C, and Mat D, and Type III strains have Mat S and Mat T genes (which are homologous <b>to</b> <b>Mat</b> C and Mat D). These sexes can only mate with the two different sexes and not with its own.|$|E

Mat Salleh lost 60 men. On 15 January 1900, the Company proceeded to acquire Taga villages and the fort of one of Mat Salleh’s chief lieutenants; Mat Sator was burned by shell-fire. They then cut the water supply <b>to</b> <b>Mat</b> Salleh’s fort by diverting the Pengkalian river to the Sensuran.|$|E

25|$|Mat Salleh {{first came}} to the Company's {{attention}} when he was suspected of involvement in the murder and robbery of two Iban traders on the Sugut River in 1894. Captain Barnett and a few other colonial officials were sent <b>to</b> <b>Mat</b> Salleh's residence to investigate the matter. Mat Salleh denied his and his followers’ involvement in it and resisted arrest. This incident marked the first of many misunderstandings, creating a tense and hostile situation between both parties.|$|E
500|$|... "Hellbound" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} David Amann and directed by Kim Manners. The entry was Amann's fourth episode written for the series, after season seven's [...] "Rush" [...] and [...] "Chimera" [...] and season eight's [...] "Invocation". Executive producer John Shiban later explained that, since Doggett and Reyes were {{in control of the}} X-Files, the producers needed to give one of them a drive. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. According <b>to</b> <b>Mat</b> Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode deals with themes of [...] "reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice." [...] Shiban noted that the conceit of the episode was whether Reyes was [...] "a good person or a bad person? Did she fight evil, or did she let evil happen." [...] It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec. In mythology, Xipe Totec is often represented wearing a flayed human skin, usually with the flayed skin of the hands falling loose from the wrists.|$|E

2500|$|Polypropylene, a {{polyolefin}} stiffer {{than the}} cheaper polyethylene, {{is used to}} produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as [...] "olefin", is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend <b>to</b> <b>mat</b> down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops {{tend to be more}} resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain does set, {{it can be difficult to}} clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4" [...] thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 Monza was {{highlighted}} {{by the addition of}} a two new Spyder option packages, a $274 performance package, the other a $199 appearance add-on package that was available only on hatchbacks. An [...] four-cylinder engine was standard, but Monzas could be ordered with a [...] V8 instead. The Monza dashboard contains round gauges in a brushed-aluminum instrument panel. The Towne Coupe cabriolet was deleted, but a half-vinyl roof and opera windows could still be ordered. The Monza Mirage was produced by Michigan Auto Techniques, an aftermarket company contracted by GM. The Mirage is painted white, with red and blue racing stripes {{along the length of the}} car. It also features flared body panels, and a special airdam and spoiler. The vehicles were built in GM's St. Therese plant, and sent <b>to</b> <b>MAT</b> for modification, after which MAT would ship completed cars to the dealer. There were approximately 4,097 1977 Mirages made by MAT, but there were also Mirages created by Chevrolet dealerships, as the body add-ons and stripes were available ordered through dealer parts. The 5.0 liter (305 CID) engine was the only V8 option for the 1977 model year. The standard Vega 2.3 aluminum-block engine was discontinued at the end of the model year, replaced with the Pontiac 2.5 [...] "Iron Duke".|$|E
