5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} <b>tuber</b> {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy <b>tuber</b> is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo <b>tuber</b> is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
40|$|Cassava (Manihot spp.) <b>tubers</b> form a major {{food source}} of {{carbohydrates}} and other food nutrients for tropical dwellers. The <b>tubers</b> also are sources of industrial {{products such as}} dextrins, glues, ethyl alcohol, acetone and glucose etc. Post -harvest losses on storage of cassava root <b>tubers</b> are large because of their poor storage qualities. In this study, wholesome cassava <b>tubers</b> were washed and disinfected for used to study the storage and spoilage of cassava <b>tubers</b> using moist saw dust in sealed boxes and some exposed as control. Profuse microbial growths occurred {{on the surface of}} <b>tubers</b> exposed on the 4 th day and were completely soften due to fermentation of the tissues on the 7 th day. Bacteria isolated from the <b>tubers</b> were species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Diplococcus. Fungal species isolated using cultural characteristics were Candida and Aspergillus. <b>Tubers</b> on moist sawdust had no microbial growth but developed secondary roots on the 3 rd day of storage. They could be stored up to 3 weeks. The sawdust acted as soil for the <b>tubers</b> while the different gases and heat evolved by the <b>tubers</b> in the sealed boxes had a curing effect on the <b>tubers.</b> The study hence recommends that storage of cassava <b>tubers</b> in moist saw-dust would provide effective preservative method against post-harvest losses...|$|R

5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} Softdisk in 1991 for DOS. It is the fourth episode of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, in an adventure in his dreams as he journeys through a vegetable kingdom to defeat the evil potato king Boobus <b>Tuber</b> and free enslaved children from the Dream machine. The game features Keen running and jumping through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them.|$|E
5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to <b>tuber</b> formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing <b>tuber</b> on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Pueraria phaseoloides {{is similar}} to its close {{relative}} P. montana and P. edulis. It can be distinguished from P.montana when comparing their <b>tubers.</b> P. phaseoloides produces really small <b>tubers</b> whereas the <b>tubers</b> of P. montana are big and edible.|$|R
50|$|Oca {{requires}} short days {{in order}} to form <b>tubers.</b> Outside the tropics, it will not begin to form <b>tubers</b> until approximately the autumn equinox. If frosts occur too soon after the autumn equinox, the plant will die before <b>tubers</b> are produced.|$|R
50|$|The Huáishān {{growing cycle}} spans {{approximately}} one year, {{and should be}} planted between winter and spring. The traditional methods growing it are: using smaller <b>tubers,</b> top cut of bigger <b>tubers</b> or through cuttings of branches. The first two methods can produce 20 cm (7.8 in) long <b>tubers</b> and above. The latter produces smaller <b>tubers</b> (10 cm or 4 in) that are usually replanted for the next year.|$|R
5|$|SR 139 runs {{northwest}} and north over mostly flat terrain {{through the center}} of the national forest and the communities of Ambrose and Perez before turning northwest. The route continues through Copic, Newell, Stronghold, Homestead, and <b>Tuber</b> before cutting across the intermittent Tule Lake as the Lava Beds Highway through the city of Tulelake. During this segment, SR 139 passes directly through the former Tule Lake Segregation Unit, used to house Japanese-Americans during WWII. After passing through the former internment camp, SR 139 continues to the Oregon state line at Hatfield. At an intersection right on the state line, SR 161 begins to the west, and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the <b>tuber</b> is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo <b>tuber</b> patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{was carried}} out at the Horticulture Farm of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh during 1992 - 93 and 1993 - 94 growing seasons to {{study the effects of}} storage {{conditions}} of seed <b>tubers</b> on the subsequent crop performance of some indigenous potato varieties. Seed <b>tubers</b> (20 - 30 mm dia) were stored either in cold storage (6 - 8 �C and 85 - 90 % relative humidity) or in diffuse light storage under thatched house conditions. Plant emergence, percent foliage coverage at 60 DAP and the number of <b>tubers</b> per hill were significantly higher in plants from cold-stored seed <b>tubers.</b> There were no significant effects of storage conditions of seed <b>tubers</b> on plant height and yield of <b>tubers</b> in 1992 - 93. Seed <b>tubers</b> stored in cold storage produced higher yield in 1993 - 94. Yield of the indigenous potato varieties differed widely. Also significant interactions were observed among varieties and storage conditions of seed <b>tubers.</b> The results of the two separate experiments in two subsequent years indicate that diffuse light storage of seed <b>tubers</b> in farm-house conditions may be practiced without substantial yield loss of indigenous potatoes in Bangladesh...|$|R
2500|$|After flowering, {{potato plants}} produce small green fruits that {{resemble}} green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 seeds.

All new potato varieties are grown from seeds, also called [...] "true potato seed", [...] "TPS" [...] or [...] "botanical seed" [...] to distinguish it from seed <b>tubers.</b> New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting <b>tubers,</b> pieces of <b>tubers</b> cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed <b>tubers.</b> Plants propagated from <b>tubers</b> are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.|$|R
40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is {{the third}} most {{important}} food crop in the world. Potato <b>tubers</b> must be stored at cold temperatures to prevent sprouting, minimize disease losses, and supply consumers and the processing industry with high-quality <b>tubers</b> throughout the year. Unfortunately, cold storage triggers an accumulation of reducing sugars in <b>tubers.</b> High-temperature processing of these <b>tubers</b> results in dark-colored, bitter-tasting products. Such products also have elevated amounts of acrylamide, a neurotoxin and potential carcinogen. We demonstrate that silencing the potato vacuolar acid invertase gene VInv prevents reducing sugar accumulation in cold-stored <b>tubers.</b> Potato chips processed from VInv silencing lines showed a 15 -fold acrylamide reduction and were light in color even when <b>tubers</b> were stored at 4 °C. Comparable, low levels of VInv gene expression were observed in cold-stored <b>tubers</b> from wild potato germplasm stocks that are resistant to cold-induced sweetening. Thus, both processing quality and acrylamide problems in potato can be controlled effectively by suppression of the VInv gene through biotechnology or targeted breeding...|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including <b>Tuber,</b> Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E
