5|$|Transmission systems {{operators}} {{will supply}} a wind farm developer with a grid code {{to specify the}} requirements for interconnection to the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> This will include power factor, constancy of frequency and dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid,</b> while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|Penetration of {{wind power}} into weak <b>transmission</b> <b>grids</b> faces {{specific}} difficulties due to security constraints. The major {{issue is the}} capability of existing <b>transmission</b> <b>grids</b> to securely absorb the wind power. This paper presents some ideas {{in order to increase}} the wind power penetration into weak networks by applying new control concepts. It also presents a methodology {{to assess the impact of}} the proposed techniques to the wind penetration achieved. The proposed rule is based on the control of the power flow from the windy area through a weak corridor...|$|R
25|$|There is {{therefore}} a physical requirement for a controlling agency, the transmission system operator, to coordinate the dispatch of generating units to meet the expected demand of the system across the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid.</b> If there is a mismatch between supply and demand the generators speed up or slow down causing the system frequency (either 50 or 60 hertz) to increase or decrease. If the frequency falls outside a predetermined range the system operator will act to add or remove either generation or load.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{electricity}} retail reform {{follows from}} electricity wholesale reform. However, {{it is possible}} to have a single electricity generation company and still have retail competition. If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the distribution system beyond the node is possible. In the German market, for example, large, vertically integrated utilities compete with one another for customers on a more or less open grid.|$|E

On 23 March, it became possible to inject water into the reactor using the feed water system rather than the fire trucks, raising the flow rate from 2 to 18m3/h (later reduced to 11m3/h, and even further to reduce the build up of contaminated water); on 24 March, electricity was restored to the central operating room.|$|E
40|$|Capítulos en librosVery large turbogenerators are {{connected}} to extra high voltage <b>grids</b> (<b>transmission</b> <b>grids).</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>grids</b> used {{to be free from}} harmonic sources. Harmonic sources are more frequent in subtransmission and distribution grids. However, as large wind farms and high speed trains are being connected to <b>transmission</b> <b>grids,</b> harmonic currents from them are more likely to disturb large turbogenerators. Harmonic currents can affect large turbogenerators in different ways: overheating, pulsating torques, vibrations and fatigue. Among them, we recall the 100 Hz issue (in 50 Hz grids). Turbine-masses torsional oscillations are in the subsynchronous frequency range whereas turbine-blade oscillations are around 100 Hz. The industry is concerned about the possible excitation of turbine-blade oscillations by external harmonic current sources. This paper reports measurements of harmonic current components in a very large turbogenerator of a nuclear power generating station in the period from 27 May through 3 June 2014. The measurement setting is described. Not only individual harmonic components are detailed but the total harmonic distortion and spectrum are also provided. The measured values are compared with the limits imposed by standards. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Critics noted that the power generation facilities were located approximately [...] away from population centres and that {{there was a lack of}} local power stations around Montreal, which is served by only six 735kV feeder lines. In addition, the 735kV transmission system received scorn from the public and the media. The power <b>transmission</b> <b>grid</b> was said to concentrate power transmission on only a few 735kV lines, such as those that run from James Bay to Montreal.

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical <b>transmission</b> <b>grid,</b> changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
