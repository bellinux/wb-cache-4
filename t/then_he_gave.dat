25|$|One day of 1925, while tiding his room, Bourguiba {{found the}} address of a woman his {{protector}} recommended to meet: Mathilde Lefras, a 35 years old widow whose husband died during the war. He met {{her for the first}} time in her apartment, on the first floor of a building in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. She invited him to enter and asked him to tell his story. Touched by it, she asked to see him once again, and, in the upcoming months, invited him to move in with her. Since <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> his room in the campus away and settled with Mathilde.|$|E

They were not coupled to his train or to each other. When he was in position each banker gave two crow whistles, and the train driver gave two crows in reply. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> one long whistle and all of them opened their regulators.|$|E

Four years passed before Judson dared even to hold a semi-public service. At first, he tried adapting to Burmese customs by wearing a yellow robe to mark himself as a teacher of religion, but he soon changed to white to show he was not a Buddhist. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> up the whole attempt as artificial and decided that, regardless of his dress, no Burmese would identify him as anything but a foreigner.|$|E

2500|$|... {{looked in}} all four {{directions}} {{and saw that the}} woman was not in the house. [...] Then he said, [...] "I will help you. [...] But , the Big Giant, is also my son. [...] I will give you weapons so that you may fight the monsters. [...] But I am the one who will strike the first blow when you fight against [...] the Big Giant. [...] I must do that myself." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the twins helmets and shirts of hard flint scales, and , the chain lightning arrows, and , the sheet lightning arrows, and , the deadly sunbeam arrows.

2500|$|In Game 1, Travis Hafner got {{the first}} run on Josh Beckett with a solo {{home run in the}} first inning. [...] Manny Ramírez {{answered}} back, driving in Kevin Youkilis with a single {{in the bottom of the}} first. [...] After that, Beckett settled in, while Indians starter C.C. Sabathia fell apart. [...] In the bottom of the third, he gave up a ground-rule double to Julio Lugo, and then after a bunt groundout for Dustin Pedroia, he walked Kevin Youkilis, hit David Ortiz, and walked Manny Ramírez to give up the lead. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> up a double to Mike Lowell that scored Youkilis and Ortiz. [...] After Bobby Kielty was walked, Jason Varitek hit a groundout that could not be turned into a double-play, scoring Ramírez. [...] The Sox tacked five more on, and win Game 1, 10–3.|$|E
2500|$|Actually, {{the locus}} classicus, the best {{formulation}} of this, was by an {{ambassador to the}} United Nations, Abba Eban, ... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism — that means actually criticisms of {{the policy of the}} state of Israel — were anti-Semitism. That’s the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it’s neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> two examples of the latter category. One was I.F. Stone. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they’re critical of the state of Israel. That’s understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don’t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There’s nothing to respond to. It’s not a form of anti-Semitism. It’s simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{one night}} in Aleppo's citadel, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch. The city was held by Surhak, a [...] "minor mamluk." [...] Saladin offered him the city of Busra and property in Damascus in exchange for Harim, but when Surhak asked for more, his own garrison in Harim forced him out. He was arrested by Saladin's deputy Taqi al-Din on allegations that {{he was planning to}} cede Harim to Bohemond III of Antioch. When Saladin received its surrender, he proceeded to arrange the defense of Harim from the Crusaders. He reported to the caliph and his own subordinates in Yemen and Baalbek that was going to attack the Armenians. Before he could move, however, {{there were a number of}} administrative details to be settled. Saladin agreed to a truce with Bohemond in return for Muslim prisoners being held by him and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> A'zaz to Alam ad-Din Suleiman and Aleppo to Saif al-Din al-Yazkuj—the former was an emir of Aleppo who joined Saladin and the latter was a former mamluk of Shirkuh who helped rescue him from the assassination attempt at A'zaz.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{months after}} the murder of Chacon, Tsa-na-gat still had not {{surrendered}} so Marshal Aquila Nebeker organized a posse of twenty-six [...] "cowboys" [...] and three sheriffs from Montezuma County, Colorado to make arrests. The posse left Bluff and headed towards Navajo Mountain. Just after dawn, {{on the morning of}} February 25, 1915, Marshal Nebeker and the posse came across Chief Polk and fifty of his men encamped in Cottonwood Gulch. The weather was very cold and snow covered the ground. One of the natives in camp spotted the approaching possemen, so he alarmed the others with [...] "woops of warning" [...] before opening fire with a rifle. Other accounts say that the posse achieved a surprise attack and began firing into the camp without warning. Either way, the posse implemented a type of [...] "Indian strategy of the kind that one is accustomed to read in the histories of early life in the West." [...] Chief Posey and his band were camped not far from the area, along the San Juan River, and when they heard the sound of the gunfire, Posey led his warriors to Polk's rescue. Posey's men, numbering about forty, maneuvered {{to the rear of the}} posse's position and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the order to engage. Shortly thereafter, Marshal Nebeker realized that he needed help, so he sent a message back to Bluff requesting reinforcements. Over the next several hours, about fifty volunteers from Bluff, Blanding, Cortez and Monticello arrived in the battle area. The fight continued all night and into the next day, when a truce was called. During the fighting, five of the possemen got separated from the rest and had to hold off the attacking natives from the top of a rocky hill. At least one American was killed, posseman [...] of Colorado, and several others were wounded, though some accounts say two possemen died.|$|E
