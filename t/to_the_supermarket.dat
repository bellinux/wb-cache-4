The new app comes from Groupon's previous acquisition of SnapSaves, a Canadian start-up that works much like Snap.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{evaluated}} the spatial accessibility of large "chain" supermarkets {{in relation to}} neighborhood racial composition and poverty. METHODS: We used a geographic information system to measure Manhattan block distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>supermarket</b> for 869 neighborhoods (census tracts) in metropolitan Detroit. We constructed moving average spatial regression models to adjust for spatial autocorrelation and <b>to</b> test for <b>the</b> effect of modification of percentage African American and percentage poor on distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>supermarket.</b> RESULTS: Distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>supermarket</b> was similar among the least impoverished neighborhoods, regardless of racial composition. Among the most impoverished neighborhoods, however, neighborhoods in which African Americans resided were, on average, 1. 1 miles further from <b>the</b> nearest <b>supermarket</b> than were White neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Racial residential segregation disproportionately places African Americans in more-impoverished neighborhoods in Detroit and consequently reduces access to supermarkets. However, supermarkets have opened or remained open close to middle-income neighborhoods that have transitioned from White to African American. Development of economically disadvantaged African American neighborhoods is critical to effectively prevent diet-related diseases among this population...|$|R

40|$|In this {{exploratory}} field-study, {{we examined}} how normative messages (i. e., activating an injunctive norm, personal norm, or both) could encourage shoppers to use fewer free plastic bags for their shopping in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket’s</b> standard environmental message {{aimed at reducing}} plastic bags. In a one-way subjects-design (N = 200) at a local supermarket, we showed that shoppers used significantly fewer free plastic bags in the injunctive, personal and combined normative message condition than in the condition where only an environmental message was present. The combined normative message did result in the smallest uptake of free plastic bags compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> injunctive and personal normative-only message, although these differences were not significant. Our findings imply that re-wording <b>the</b> <b>supermarket’s</b> environmental message by including normative information could be a promising way <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> use of free plastic bags, which will ultimately benefit the environmen...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} {{as to why}} warehouse clubs charge membership fees and how the fees {{play a role in}} the competitive landscape of the retail grocery market. We provide another insight into the nature of the membership fee using a model of price competition between a warehouse club and a supermarket. We show that the warehouse club’s membership fee is an optimal competitive reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>supermarket’s</b> promotional activity. <b>The</b> more frequent the promotion is, the lower is the membership fee. However, the larger the promotion depth is, the higher is the fee. Our analysis not only provides a justification of warehouse club membership fees but also gives managers several guidelines on yearly fee and retail price decisions...|$|R

The instruments for data collection were primarily a documentary research with shutdown interviews, followed by a focus group and a semi-structured interview. The documentary research guided the focus group script elaboration, carried out with company employees, as well as the semi-structured interview guide conducted with the Human Resources network manager.

40|$|<b>The</b> rise of <b>supermarkets</b> in Indonesia {{since the}} end of the 1990 s have been {{transforming}} the food retail sector and providing further market opportunities for small-scale farmers, in which most of Indonesia’s farmer falls into this category. The aim of this paper is <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> participation and its effect on the well-being of small-scale farmers. We compare the differences between participants and non-participants in supermarket channels in order <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> constraints on <b>supermarket</b> participation. By applying a treatment effects model which allows capturing the possibility of selection bias, we examine the factors that determine farmers’ participation as well as the effect on their income. The results show that younger farmers with higher levels of education, irrigated land, who have packaging equipment and storage facilities, and are located near paved roads, are more likely <b>to</b> participate in <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> channels. On <b>the</b> other hand, farmers who have sprayer equipment are more likely <b>to</b> participate in <b>the</b> traditional market channels. The effect analysis shows that small-scale farmer participation in <b>the</b> <b>supermarket</b> channels can boost their income...|$|R
