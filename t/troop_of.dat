5|$|In early March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division (including Div Cav) was {{earmarked}} for W Force, the British Commonwealth force sent to Greece to bolster its defence against imminent German invasion. The regiment embarked for Greece on 18 March 1941 on the Greek ship Ionia, with its vehicles aboard the cargo ship Anglo-Canadian. The ships arrived at Piraeus on 21 March and the troops {{stayed at the}} transit camp at Kifisia.

E <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> the 5th Field Regiment and O <b>Troop</b> <b>of</b> the 7th Anti-Tank Regiment were attached to the regiment. On 4 April, the regiment sent two troops of Marmon-Harrington armoured cars to reinforce the British 1st Armoured Brigade on the Macedonian plain; in exchange, the regiment received seven cruiser tanks. The two troops withdrew with the 1st Armoured Brigade when it retreated on 8 April and reached Perdikkas by the following day. The regiment and E Troop, 5th Field Regiment, were the only units left on the plain between Mount Olympus and the Aliakmon on 8 April. The next day, A Squadron demolished the main bridge across the Aliakmon, after the 1st Armoured Brigade had withdrawn southward.|$|E
5|$|Marischal {{then joined}} with the Engager faction, who had {{made a deal with}} the king, and led a <b>troop</b> <b>of</b> horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists.

Of these, the Nilgiri langur was randomly distributed, whereas the lion-tailed macaque troops were confined to the southern sector of the Park.

Tech played two other games {{during their first}} season and lost both of them for a season record of 0–3. Discouraged by these results, the Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record. Leonard Wood, an Army officer and Atlantan, heard of Tech's football struggles and volunteered to player-coach the team.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} legends behind Manneken Pis, {{but the most}} famous is the one about Duke Godfrey III of Leuven.

5|$|The 2/28th Battalion probed {{into the}} Pocket on 16 June. The {{previous}} day a 2/11th Commando Squadron patrol had {{reported that the}} track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled, and {{on the morning of}} the 16th A Company from the 2/28th Battalion accompanied by a <b>troop</b> <b>of</b> three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it. After the bulldozer filled the crater, the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south-east of the ridge. One of the Australian tanks was damaged. A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2/11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back, with two Australians killed and another wounded. A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon, supported by a new <b>troop</b> <b>of</b> tanks. The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry, and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel, but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged. By the end of the day, A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded. Overall, 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade's attached medical units during 16 June, which stretched their capacity.|$|E

The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a <b>troop</b> <b>of</b> Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
