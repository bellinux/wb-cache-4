On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|On June 13, 2017, Rodman {{returned}} to North Korea {{on what was}} initially described as a sports-related visit to the country. [...] "My purpose is to go over <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea," [...] Rodman said. He added that he hoped to accomplish [...] "something that's pretty positive." [...] During the visit, Rodman met with national Olympic athletes, male and female basketball players, viewed a men's basketball practice, and visited a state-run orphanage.

500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes out of your way, you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E

60|$|WE WERE now in {{the first}} days of April. Joan was ill. She had fallen ill the 29th of March, the day after the close of the third trial, and was growing worse when the scene which I have just {{described}} occurred in her cell.

6000|$|... "A {{few days}} ago. She came {{to say she}} could not take the time from the Synthesis to pay me that little visit. I'm afraid she's working too hard. Of course, she's very ambitious; but I can't {{understand}} her not wanting to show her picture, <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to sell it." ...|$|R
60|$|There were none, so {{school was}} {{dismissed}} for the day. Peter didn't go straight home.

Especially he looked at the hoofs of the old ram.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well; if she doesn't return to-morrow, {{mind you}} go <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to {{discover}} which man it is, and see him.

6000|$|... "I'll tell you. The {{back door}} of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because {{he said he was}} going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that ain't the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{cut through}} his guard, {{but it turned}} my sword. But I laid his face open, {{and it will be}} some time before he will be fit to show himself to a lady. If, as I expect, I can get no help at Moulins, I shall ride on to Monsieur de la Vallee's place, gather some men <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to cut the party off before they get to Tulle. If I am too late, I shall see what I can do to rescue them. From la Vallee I shall go to Pointdexter.

6000|$|... "Why, yes, you must," [...] she said, <b>and</b> if <b>there</b> was any censure {{of him at}} {{the bottom}} of her heart, she kept it <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to talk him away from his remorse, which was in his temperament, perhaps, rather than his conscience; she made the time pass till there came a knock at the door, and she opened it to Hinkle.|$|R
500|$|Tracy {{introduces}} Seaweed to Penny, {{and the two}} are smitten.

She changes her mind after she and Wilbur reconcile.|$|R
60|$|Then with a groan {{he gave up}} the argument, and as {{he found}} breath they {{discussed}} their chances. Their first idea was to hide, but save for a few trees all the country was open; {{there was no place}} to cover them. They thought of the banks of the Zambesi, but between them and the river rose a bare, rock-strewn hill with several miles of slope. Long before they could reach its crest, even if a horse were able to travel there, they must be overtaken. In short, {{there was nothing to do}} except to push for the nek, and if they were fortunate enough to reach it before the Matabele, to abandon the horse <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to conceal themselves among the ruins of the houses beyond. This, perhaps, they might do when once the sun was down.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're dead right," [...] {{he said to}} Jill approvingly. [...] "If you ask me, that's {{the only}} {{sensible}} thing to do. Where's the sense of hanging around and getting stalled? Managers are human guys, some of 'em. Probably, {{if you were to}} try it, they'd appreciate a bit of gall. It would show 'em you'd got pep. You go down <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> walking straight in. They can't eat you. It makes me sick when I see all those poor devils hanging about outside these offices, waiting to get noticed and nobody ever paying any attention to them. You push the office-boy in the face if he tries to stop you, and go in and make 'em take notice. And, whatever you do, don't leave your name and address! That's the old, moth-eaten gag they're sure to try to pull on you. Tell 'em there's nothing doing. Say you're out for a quick decision! Stand 'em on their heads!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Root for {{us if you}} will, hate us if you must[...] [...] [...] But I can't {{think of}} a more {{interesting}} business news story that you're ever gonna hear about this fucking year, man.

50|$|He {{reaches the}} spot but Aman is present <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> to stop Raka. Raka sticks Aman {{against the tree}} <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> to kill him.

Raka tries to insert the saw blade into his neck {{but as soon as}} it touches the skin, a sudden {{thunderstorm}} hits the tree. The impact throws back Raka and he lands in Malhotra's factory's garbage area.|$|R
5000|$|In 1895, the Bulgarian Hibbat Zion {{movement}} {{bought the}} 5,000-dunam farm from the London Jews Society and renamed it Har-Tuv (lit. Mountain of Good). Twelve Jewish families settled <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> {{to earn a}} living from agriculture. Due to the poor quality of the soil, and lack of water, seeds and work implements, life in Hartuv was a struggle. In 1900, one of the settlers inaugurated a carriage service to Jerusalem.|$|R
5000|$|Kane now {{devoted his}} whole {{time to the}} union, {{temporarily}} moving to Walsall {{in an attempt to}} gain new members <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> to make agreements with the rival Associated Ironworkers of Great Britain union.

5000|$|A strict curfew was {{enforced}} in Belfast {{after the}} violence, {{to try to}} ensure the Orange Order's 12 July marches passed off peacefully. Directly after the violence, on 11 July, the Commandant of the IRA's 2nd Northern Division, Eoin O'Duffy, was sent to Belfast by the organization's leadership in Dublin to liaise with the British authorities <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to maintain the truce.

5000|$|In the British comedy-drama film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench), one of {{the main}} characters, {{explains}} dunking to her new employer during an interview whilst drinking Builder's tea.
