25|$|Season two {{begins with}} the end of summer school. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also {{revealed}} that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father. Adrianna is desperate to become a normal teenager, giving up acting, and, much to Navid's dismay, their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of Teddy Montgomery, Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school. Annie begins to date Jasper, which began as a guilt-ridden friendship but later turned into a relationship. Jasper is different from any other boy Annie has dated. He is more quiet and mysterious compared to her past boyfriends. Dixon meets a girl named Sasha when he begins his DJing career and is performing near her in a yacht, to whom he lies about his real age. Navid and Adrianna's relationship continues to tremble when Adrianna continues to find Teddy alluring. In the meantime, Harry and Debbie face marital problems when Harry confides to Kelly about his family troubles. Naomi finds out that her SAT scores are not high enough to get into California University, so she decides to date the Dean of Admission's son, Richard. She later falls for Richard's roommate, Jamie. Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} {{over the course of}} a school semester; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> is on April 1. In [...] "boy mode", each day concludes with a super {{deformed}} image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the monitor. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a thought bubble above her head. In [...] "girl mode", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a [...] "Strawberry chance" [...] system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message [...] is displayed in the upper right screen corner.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{called the}} third season [...] "a series {{at the top}} of its game", scoring the season a 9.3 out of 10. In particular, Canning noted that the [...] "first half of the year... had the most focus." [...] Canning said the premiere episode [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "filled to {{capacity}} with comedy", called [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] "near perfect", but said the story for the finale [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] but [...] "average for a season finale." [...] Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly, reviewing the DVD release, gave the season an A−. Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine also reviewed the premiere, saying it was [...] "sort of like <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same". Brian Lowry of Variety was more critical, calling the third season [...] "wildly uneven" [...] and saying 30 Rock was [...] "merely a good comedy whose shortcomings prevent it from joining the ranks of great ones." [...] Metacritic, which gives a score based on critical reviews, gave the season a rating of 84% from 17 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E
50|$|In some {{cultures}} in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Germany), the astronomical Vernal equinox (varying between 19 and 21 March) is taken to mark <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> spring, and <b>the</b> Summer solstice (around 21 June) is taken as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> summer. In Persian culture <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> spring is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> month (called Farvardin) which begins on 20 or 21 March. In other traditions, the equinox is taken as mid-spring.|$|R
50|$|The {{followers}} of the Mithraic mysteries consider <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> Dey to be the birthday of the Sun, because the days lengthen afterwards. Ancient Persians used to start their years with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> winter and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, making khorram rooz their Nowrooz—the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> their year.|$|R

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, saying it [...] " [...] {{the bar for}} the rest of the season" [...] and was [...] "filled to capacity with comedy." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine commented that [...] "Do-Over" [...] was [...] "sort of like <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote [...] "...this episode manages to do what the show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart." [...] TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed [...] "Do-Over", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to be a couple in front of Kathy. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes [...] "tend to be 30 Rocks Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx." [...] He said that the [...] "frenetic farcical plotting" [...] of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming". In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode an A- grade rating.|$|E
500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label me. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on just any song", and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away". Milian co-wrote the track [...] "Twitch" [...] with R singer Montell Jordan, which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies.|$|E
500|$|As late as March 2011, McGary ranked 92nd in the {{national}} class of 2012 by Rivals.com. [...] During the LeBron James Skills Academy in July, McGary stood out as {{the best player in}} attendance. [...] He was {{invited to participate in the}} 5th annual Nike Global Challenge the following month. Due to an ankle injury he did not participate. [...] However, later that month, he participated in the Boost Mobile Elite 24 event, where he shattered a backboard. His other 2011 summer camps included Pittsburgh Jam Fest, the National Basketball Players Association Top 100 camp and the Under Armour Best of the Best Camp, where he was the most valuable player. Also in August, ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six: University of Florida, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Duke University and University of Kentucky. Because McGary does not like to be the bearer of bad news, when he narrowed his list, he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services. McGary scheduled his official Michigan visit for the beginning of September. McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Duke University, in that order, by October 4. [...] However, due to injuries suffered a few weeks earlier while shattering the backboard, he only played pick-up games at Duke. He also made an unofficial visit to Florida prior to these official visits. While Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander was recruiting him, a Brewster Academy groundskeeper relayed a story about McGary consoling a freshman who was in tears when his parents dropped him off on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>school.</b> [...] Alexander says the groundskeeper told him that [...] "McGary spotted the kid from a distance, stopped his conversation and ran to him, consoled him and brought him into school with his group of friends." [...] Alexander said that McGary's character made him a great fit for Michigan.|$|E
