40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method to determine direct geometrical distances to quasars that can measure the cosmological constant, Lambda, with minimal assumptions. This method {{is equivalent to}} geometric parallax, with the `standard length' being {{the size of the}} quasar broad emission line region (BELR) as determined from the light travel <b>time</b> measurements <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> mapping. The effect of non-zero Lambda on angular diameter is large, 40 % at z= 2, so mapping angular diameter distances vs. redshift will give Lambda with (relative) ease. In principle these measurements could be made in the UV, optical, near infrared or even X-ray bands. Interferometers with a resolution of 0. 01 mas are needed to measure the size of the BELR in z= 2 quasars, which appear plausible given reasonable short term extrapolations of current technology.

40|$|Perceptual {{measures}} are usually considered {{more reliable than}} instrumental measures for evaluating the perceived level <b>of</b> <b>reverberation.</b> However, such {{measures are}} costly in both time and money, and, due to variations in stimuli or assessors, the resulting data is not always statistically significant.

The thesis found Kinsler et al. 's theory on damped modes and absorption of modes with grazing incidence to be poorly suited for the shoebox-shaped room with five hard walls and one absorber wall. Grazing modes and non-grazing modes were not separable, neither by reverberation time estimates nor by sound intensity measurements. The reverberation time estimates using the damped modes & grazing mode absorption theory were several orders of magnitude less than the observed reverberation time. The most likely weakness in the theory is thought to be the assumption on wall impedance, which does not fit with porous absorbers on rigid walls...|$|R

40|$|Speech {{reception}} thresholds {{were measured}} in virtual rooms {{to investigate the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> on speech intelligibility for spatially separated targets and interferers. The measurements were realized under headphones, using target sentences and noise or two-voice interferers. The room simulation allowed variation of the absorption coefficient of the room surfaces independently for target and interferer. The direct-to-reverberant ratio and interaural coherence of sources were also varied independently by considering binaural and diotic listening. The main effect <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> on the interferer was binaural and mediated by the coherence, in agreement with binaural unmasking theories. It appeared at lower reverberation levels than the effect <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> on the target, which was mainly monaural and associated with the direct-to-reverberant ratio, and {{could be explained by}} the loss of amplitude modulation in the reverberant speech signals. This effect was slightly smaller when listening binaurally. Reverberation might also be responsible for a disruption of the mechanism by which the auditory system exploits fundamental frequency differences to segregate competing voices, and a disruption of the “listening in the gaps” associated with speech interferers.

40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} is {{an important}} factor for successful speech communication in today's society. So-called near-end listening enhancement (NELE) algorithms aim at improving speech intelligibility in conditions where the (clean) speech signal is accessible and can be modified prior to its presentation. However, many of these algorithms only consider the detrimental effect of noise and disregard the effect <b>of</b> <b>reverberation.</b> Therefore, in this paper we propose to additionally incorporate the detrimental effects <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> into noise-adaptive near-end listening enhancement algorithms. Based on the Speech Transmission Index (STI), which is widely used for speech intelligibility prediction, the effect <b>of</b> <b>reverberation</b> is effectively accounted for as an additional noise power term. This combined noise power term is used in a state-of-the-art noise-adaptive NELE algorithm. Simulations using two objective measures, the STI and the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to improve the predicted speech intelligibility in noisy and reverberant conditions...|$|R

40|$|Models {{and methods}} for {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> in nonlinear imaging techniques {{are presented in}} this thesis. Four independent papers provide insight on nonlinear propagation effects, a theoretical description <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> and the effects <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> on conventional and second-harmonic ultrasound imaging. Two papers, Paper A and C, describe methods used to investigate nonlinear distortion and reverberations, whereas Paper B and D concentrate on acoustic phenomena and performance of conventional and second-harmonic imaging. Paper A provides a comparison of Field II, the Texas code and Abersim; three freely available simulation tools. If analytic solutions exist, these are used as gold standards for the comparison, {{and when they do}} not; high resolution Field II or Texas code simulations are defined to be the gold standard. The comparison suggests that Abersim performs equivalent or better than the two other methods in solving diffraction, attenuation and nonlinear distortion. In Paper B, the effects of transmit beamforming and safety regulations on second-harmonic generation at two different frequencies are investigated. The safety regulations are imposed through a limitation of the maximum mechanical index of the transmit beam. Abersim is used as the simulation tool. The results suggest that the two frequencies perform equivalently when the transmit beamforming is equal in terms of wavelengths and the medium has a linear-in-frequency attenuation. Nonlinear frequency dependent attenuation and heterogeneous effects are suggested to be the main cause of the reduced improvements of second-harmonic imaging at higher frequencies. Paper C presents a time-domain Spectral Element Method for nonlinear propagation in a finite spatial domain. The method is shown to perform well when compared with analytic plane wave solutions and in a two-dimensional comparison with Abersim. The Spectral Element Method is suggested to be accurate for heterogeneous media, but this is not investigated or verified. The last paper concentrate on reverberations. A mathematical description <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> is presented along with a classification system. The main results state that reverberations always act in reciprocal pairs, and that secondharmonic suppression <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> is a combined effect of transmit beam intensity and a reverberation weight filter presented in the paper. The thesis provides insight on the description <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> and how they can be investigated. The influence <b>of</b> <b>reverberations</b> on ultrasound imaging is suggested to be more severe in applications where the object of interest is fully submerged in heterogeneous tissue. Deeper understanding of ultrasound acoustics may lead to new nonlinear imaging techniques where the noise contribution can be separated from the first-order echo. In turn, this might provide better gray scale images and ultrasound diagnoses. </p...|$|R
