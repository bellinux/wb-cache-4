5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from the}} insides of the corners. Pirelli chose <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> and medium compounds for the event.|$|E

25|$|As {{required}} by the qualifying regulations, the top 9 qualifiers all started on the faster red-banded super soft tyres, with 10th placed Jenson Button who did not set a time in Q3 choosing to start on <b>the</b> yellow-banded <b>softs.</b> <b>The</b> remaining drivers had a choice of tyres; Kimi Räikkönen, Nico Hülkenberg, Sergio Pérez, Pastor Maldonado and Pedro de la Rosa opted for <b>the</b> <b>softs,</b> <b>the</b> remainder for <b>the</b> super <b>softs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, {{also known}} as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race: one dry compound, <b>the</b> <b>Soft</b> and three wet-weather compounds, the Intermediate, Heavy Wet and <b>the</b> <b>Soft</b> wet tyres.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E

5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation and <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs {{to feed on}} trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E

5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack.
