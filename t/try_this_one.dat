Queensland responded soon after with an unconverted try, and then, after some fast play, scored a second <b>try,</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> converted to put the visitors ahead 4–8. Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides.

The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original {{back in the days when}} the letters 'N E S' meant something. Now the game is just getting redundant.

Laissez-faire and much else being once well dead, how many 'impossibles' will become possible! They are impossible, as cotton-cloth at two-pence an ell was--till men set about making it. The inventive genius of great England will not forever sit patient with mere wheels and pinions, bobbins, straps and billy-rollers whirring in the head of it.

30|$|After the reset, the 1 D jet {{boundary}} is {{no longer}} a contact but a more general discontinuity. In particular, the jet plasma will generally have radial velocity component. If it is positive, but in the external gas it is set to zero, then a shock wave will launched into the jet when this discontinuity is resolved. If it is negative, then this will be a rarefaction wave. On the <b>one</b> hand, <b>this</b> reflects how the information about changing environment is communicated to the interior of a steady-state jet. On the other hand, in 1 D simulations the strength of the emitted wave depends on the external density - higher density, and hence lower temperature, will result in stronger waves moving into the jet. This is obviously not so for 2 D steady-state jets, which react only to the external pressure. Thus additional measures need to be undertaken. First, in order to negate the effect of the radial velocity jump at the jet boundary, the radial velocity of the external gas is reset not to zero but to its value at the last jet cell. Second, in order reduce the role of the external gas inertia, it helps to set its density to a low value, so that its sound speed becomes relativistic. Although we have not <b>tried</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> could set the polytropic index of the external gas to Γ= 2, which would make the sound speed of ultra-relativistically hot gas equal to the speed of light.|$|R
