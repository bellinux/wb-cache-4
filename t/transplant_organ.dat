To explore bodily experiences, a semi-structured ad hoc interview was done on a sample of 16 transplanted women who had completed a pregnancy. The interview was designed to explore the possible similarities between their perception of the <b>transplanted</b> <b>organ</b> (liver) and of the fetus. Results. The main findings that emerge from our study are the following: a) in the post-transplant, pre-pregnancy phase, these women develop a polarized attention on the transplanted organ; b) during pregnancy this attention shifts towards the fetus; c) after childbirth the hyper-attention on the <b>transplanted</b> <b>organ</b> disappears and the subject resumes a normal relationship with her body.

50|$|In December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister {{acknowledged}} {{that the practice of}} removing organs from executed prisoners for transplant was widespread - as many as 95% of all organ transplants in China derived from executions, and he promised steps to prevent abuse.

According to Time, a transplant brokerage in Japan which organised 30-50 operations annually sourced its organs from executed prisoners in China.

5000|$|Currently, {{with little}} {{incentive}} to donate an organ, approximately 6,000 people die yearly waiting for a <b>transplant</b> <b>organ.</b> David Holberg has argued that regulating the organ trade could solve the organ shortage and create safer, fair practices for donors.

These lowered organ prices {{could result in a}} disincentive to engage in black market organ trading, since illegal brokers would have less to gain financially. Additionally, the increased supply would result in shorter waiting periods for transplant recipients, which would in turn reduce hospital costs.|$|E
25|$|Transgenes {{may soon}} be used for {{xenotransplantation}} from pig organs.

However, the antigen begins to be expressed later on, and rejection occurs. Therefore, further research is being conducted.|$|R

5000|$|The United Network for Organ Sharing defines {{transplant}} tourism as [...] "the {{purchase of a}} <b>transplant</b> <b>organ</b> abroad that includes access to an organ while bypassing laws, rules, or processes of any or all countries involved."

5000|$|Immune {{tolerance}} can {{be defined}} as the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self, or harmless and harmful. T-cells are able to distinguish between self and non-self largely through their T-cell receptor, or TCR. Immune tolerance is maintained by central and peripheral tolerance. During central tolerance, T-cells are selected in the thymus and allowed to enter the periphery based on the ability of the T-cell to recognize self-peptides (via its TCR) being presented in the context of self-MHC. If the TCR binds the peptide-MHC complex with high affinity, the T cell is deleted from the host. In a healthy individual this process eliminates the majority of T-cells that are self-reactive, although a few T-cells will escape thymic deletion. However, these potentially self-reactive cells in the periphery are held in check by a number of regulatory mechanisms such as active suppression by regulatory T cells(Tregs), clonal anergy, deletion, and ignorance. [...] While autoimmunity is thought to result from the breakdown of central and peripheral tolerance, an undesirable immune responses such as <b>transplant</b> <b>organ</b> rejection occurs when the immune system is working properly and recognizes the transplanted organ as being non-self, leading to rejection of the transplanted tissue. In this context, manipulating the immune system to recognize the transplanted organ as self for the induction of immunological tolerance would be beneficial for the establishment of transplant tolerance.|$|E

The objective of this study was to examine the representations of the <b>transplanted</b> <b>organ</b> and their relationship with emotional and mood factors, illness perceptions, and the functioning of the <b>transplanted</b> <b>organ.</b> One hundred and sixty-four kidney transplant patients were assessed using the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, the Beck’s Depression Scale, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, and the <b>Transplanted</b> <b>Organ</b> Questionnaire. Medical parameters were collected from the routine clinical blood tests (serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate levels) and biopsy results. Our most outstanding results suggest that kidney-transplanted patients’ illness representations are associated with health outcomes. The <b>Transplanted</b> <b>Organ</b> Questionnaire “psychological rejection” subscale was connected with higher serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate levels. Logistic regression analysis showed that psychological rejection subscale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, and Posttraumatic Growth Questionnaire total scores were associated with graft rejection.

40|$|The major {{research}} objectives in organ transplantation are to palliate {{the lack of}} organs, to decrease the adverse effects of chronic immunosuppression and to improve medium-term and long-term graft survival. Xenotransplantation and induction of a permanent and specific tolerance to an allograft therefore represent two main lines of research which could partly resolve the problems of organ transplantation. The objective {{of this article is}} to evaluate the possible role of gene therapy in the development of xenotransplantation and induction of allograft tolerance. They review the various gene vectors currently available as well as the routes of administration of these vectors specific to transplantation. The place of gene therapy is then evaluated in the context of allo- and xenotransplantation. In allotransplantation, transfection of certain genes of interest into the <b>transplant</b> <b>organ</b> before implantation or into the recipient's immune system is considered. Transfection into the <b>transplant</b> <b>organ</b> of genes coding for immunomodulating cytokines (TGF-beta, IL- 4, IL- 10, etc.), molecules which block the second signal (CTLA 4 -Ig) or molecules responsible for apoptosis (Fas/FasL) is discussed. The value of gene therapy in the recipient's immune system consists of transfection onto the recipient's bone marrow cells of genes coding for major histocompatibility system molecules (HLA-DR, DQ, etc.). In xenotransplantation, gene therapy will certainly play a major role in the development of transgenic pigs expressing, on the surface endothelium of their organs, certain human molecules which regulate the activity of complement (CD 55, CD 59, etc.) or which modify the expression of glycosylated xenoantigens (alpha-galactosyl) recognized by performed antibodies...|$|E
