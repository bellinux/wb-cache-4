25|$|A {{key issue}} in CCBT use is low uptake and {{completion}} rates, {{even when it}} has been clearly made available and explained.

Another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as <b>treatment</b> <b>outcome,</b> is to design software that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{treatment}} of MDR-TB and HIV co-infected patients, we investigated the relationship between health system performance and patient <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> at 4 decentralised MDR-TB sites. In this mixed methods case study which included prospective comparative data, we measured health system performance using a framework of domains comprising key health service components. Using Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficients we quantified the direction and magnitude of the association between health system performance and MDR-TB <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Qualitative data from participant observation and interviews analysed using systematic text condensation (STC) complemented our quantitative findings. We found significant differences in <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> across the sites with successful outcomes varying from 72 % at Site 1 to 52 % at Site 4 (p< 0. 01). Health systems performance scores also varied considerably across the sites. Our findings suggest there is a correlation between <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> and overall health system performance which is significant (r = 0. 99, p< 0. 01), with Site 1 having {{the highest number of}} successful <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> and the highest health system performance. Although the 'integration' domain, which measured integration of MDR-TB services into existing services appeared to have the strongest association with successful <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> (r = 0. 99, p< 0. 01), qualitative data indicated that the 'context' domain influenced the other domains. We suggest that there is an association between <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> and health system performance. The chance of treatment success is greater if decentralised MDR-TB services are integrated into existing services. To optimise successful <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes,</b> regular monitoring and support are needed at a district, facility and individual level to ensure the local context is supportive of new programmes and implementation is according to guidelines...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific <b>treatment</b> <b>outcome</b> for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.|$|E
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve <b>treatment</b> <b>outcome,</b> reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E

50|$|The {{types of}} {{homework}} used in psychotherapy {{are not limited}} to thought records and behavioral experiments, which tend to be relatively structured in their implementation.

For example, Helbig-Lang and colleagues found that, in an environment where systematic homework assignment procedures were rare but where overall homework compliance remained high, homework compliance was not positively related to <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Another group of researchers looked at patients with depression who were in remission and undergoing maintenance therapy and found that homework compliance did not correlate with <b>treatment</b> <b>outcomes</b> in this sample, either.
