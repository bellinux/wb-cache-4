In October 1978, Morland got Representative Ronald V. Dellums to submit a series of questions about plutonium production to the Department of Energy (DOE), the successor to the AEC. The DOE responded by classifying the questions. In September and October 1978, the House Armed Services Committee held hearings on the proposed Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away.

Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that chief {{executive}} officers of publicly-held corporations in the United States are losing power to their boards of directors and to their shareholders. This loss of power is recent (say, since 2000) and gradual, but nevertheless represents a significant {{move away from the}} imperial CEO who was surrounded by a hand-picked board and lethargic shareholders. After discussing the concept of power and its dimensions, we document the causes and symptoms of the decline in CEO power in several areas: share ownership composition and shareholder activism; governance rules and the board response to shareholder activism; regulatory changes related to shareholder voting; changes in the board of directors; and executive compensation. We argue that this decline in CEO power represent a long-term trend, rather than a temporary response to economic and political conditions. The decline in CEO power has several important implications, including implications with respect to the possibility of a regulatory backlash against certain newly empowered shareholder groups, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> who will serve on corporate boards in <b>the</b> future, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> shareholder initiatives that will be introduced and the corporate response to them, the convergence of corporate laws across countries, and the source of resistance to acquisitions and the legal regulation of target defenses...|$|R

40|$|Undue {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on rising rates of readmission to psychiatric facilities. After a decade of preoccupation with discharge rates, readmission statistics have been singled out in the last 15 years as the key factor for assessing hospital effectiveness. A study of a group of patients at high risk for recurrent hospitalization revealed that these patients were characterized more by features relating to environmental supports than by diagnosis. The operational definition for recurrent hospitalization (five or more admissions during the 2 -year period preceding the latest admission) was effective in identifying this group; this is the first reported instance in which the definition has specified a certain number of admissions within a time-limited period. The findings of this study, as well as of an analysis of case histories and consumer opinion, led to the design of a pilot program for persons undergoing recurrent hospitalization. Readmission statistics are useless or misleading as measures of hospital effectiveness and efficiency; what matters is the way the former patients function in the community after discharge.

2500|$|The first {{character}} sketches {{were submitted}} in 2012. Soejima {{worked closely with}} Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes. Due to being high school students, Soejima {{found it difficult to}} make each main character's uniform design distinctive, instead expressing their individuality through their thief costumes. The protagonist's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. The protagonist needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall artstyle, and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of Persona 5 revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by the protagonist voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, the protagonist was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the [...] "phantom thief" [...] premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew the protagonist and main cast in a style similar to shōnen manga, but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the Persona series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, the protagonist was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine the Persona 5 protagonist as <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who made plans but did not share them with others. The Persona designs, being based on literary characters, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.|$|E

Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President.

We begin with a description of well-characterized Bipolar I adults of the past. Retrospective studies examining the childhood characteristics of adults with Bipolar are reviewed. Then we examine <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> children receiving <b>the</b> diagnosis of Pediatric Bipolar and delineate how the behavior of these children differs from the pattern of behavior exhibited by adults with classical Bipolar, thus raising the question of whether Pediatric Bipolar is a childhood manifestation of classical Bipolar. Next we discuss the changes in the DSM IV which greatly expanded <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> included under <b>the</b> Bipolar label. Then we review studies examining the children of parents with well-characterized Bipolar I and studies examining children of parents meeting criteria under the expanded definition of Bipolar. We conclude that only children of parents meeting criteria for Bipolar under the expanded definition are similar to children being diagnosed with Pediatric Bipolar, while the children of parents with classical Bipolar I are not similar. Because the new people added to the traditional Bipolar population do not share a genetic diathesis with the traditional Bipolar diagnosed <b>person</b> <b>of</b> the past, we question the usefulness of having broadened the Bipolar label to children and, perhaps, their parents.
