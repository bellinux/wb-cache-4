2500|$|Most diesel {{locomotives}} {{are capable of}} multiple unit operation (MU) {{as a means of}} increasing horsepower and tractive effort when hauling heavy trains. All North American locomotives, including export models, use a standardized AAR electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin jumper cable between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a consist are referred to as <b>trainlines.</b> [...] The result is that all locomotives in a consist behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air <b>trainline</b> controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] <b>trainline</b> was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire <b>trainline,</b> in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive.

[...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops.

Lack datas for the transmission through the buildings are to find out by measurements (excitation by trans - this is the better way - or by substitude exciters). Following substitude excisters were tested: impact hammer, hammer mechanism, shaker, vibration plate. Premeasurements showed good results using 'impact hammer' and 'hammer mechanism'. Numerous measurements in buildings nearby at grade <b>trainlines</b> were carried out. By correlation-calculations the dependence between different immission values were find out.
