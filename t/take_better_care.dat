Sometime between his {{deposition}} and his death the widow of King Edward and sister of King Harold, Edith of Wessex, visited him in his imprisonment and allegedly told him to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of himself.

5|$|Sumartini (abbreviated as Tini) is Tono's ultra-modern wife. While in university, she {{was very}} popular and enjoyed partying. During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono, an act which is viewed as {{unacceptable}} in traditional Indonesian culture; when Hartono left her, Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men. After marrying Tono, she felt increasingly lonely and became involved in social work {{as an effort to}} give her life meaning. After learning of Tono's infidelity and seeing that Yah could <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of him, Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E

25|$|About 2000, Eastlake, Ohio, {{resident}} Michelle A. Day began pressing {{city officials}} to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of Woodland Cemetery. At first, Day worked alone, volunteering to straight headstones, lobbying local funerary monument companies to donate new markers for famous people, and visiting city archives to develop her own database of Woodland's burials. By 2003, {{a small group}} of volunteers had formed around Day to help maintain the cemetery and act as advocates for it.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of his health, and he grudgingly {{followed}} their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, Ruth entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed {{that he had an}} inoperable malignant tumor {{at the base of his}} skull and in his neck. The malady was a lesion known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or [...] "lymphoepithelioma." [...] His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. Having lost , he was discharged from the hospital in February and went to Florida to recuperate. He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, Happy Chandler (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000.|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E

2500|$|Studies {{show that}} {{patients}} who have whitened their teeth <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of them. [...] However, a tooth whitening product with an overall low pH can put enamel at risk for decay or destruction by demineralization. Consequently, care should be taken and risk evaluated when choosing a product which is very acidic. Tooth whiteners in toothpastes work through a mechanical action. They have mild abrasives which aid in the removal of stains on enamel. Although this {{can be an effective}} method, it does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Microabrasion techniques employ both methods. An acid is used first to weaken the outer 22ndash&27 micrometers of enamel in order to weaken it enough for the subsequent abrasive force. [...] This allows for removal of superficial stains in the enamel. If the discoloration is deeper or in the dentin, this method of tooth whitening will not be successful.|$|E

Unknown to them, George's decision to reject Von Hussler has cost the bank dearly, and he is suspended without pay. George explodes with rage at the children and they are sent to the nursery. Reacting to her father's outburst, Mary briefly points out that {{other members of the}} family are rarely there {{to take care of the}} parents, before Jane and Michael get into a fight over Jane's doll Valentine, prompting a displeased Mary to order them to bed and enchant them to sleep. The frightening consequence of Jane's anger becomes apparent moments afterwards, as Valentine and the rest of Jane and Michael's disgruntled toys come to life and join Mary in teaching them a lesson in how to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of their belongings and toys (formerly [...] "Temper, Temper", now [...] "Playing the Game").|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because we want to <b>take</b> <b>better</b> <b>care</b> of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
