5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface}} of the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> {{gravitational}} waves {{are caused by}} scattering of linear waves onto the space-time curvature generated by the total mass-energy of the source. Quite naturally, <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> are caused by curvature scattering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> waves themselves. <b>The</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> {{are associated with the}} cubic non-linear interaction between two mass monopole moments and, dominantly, the mass quadrupole of the source. In this paper we determine the radiation field at large distances from the source for this particular monopole-monopole-quadrupole interaction. We find that <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> appear at <b>the</b> third post-Newtonian (3 PN) order beyond the usual quadrupole radiation. Motivated by the need of accurate templates {{to be used in the}} data analysis of future detectors of {{gravitational waves}}, we compute <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>tails,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails,</b> up to <b>the</b> 3. 5 PN order in the energy flux generated by inspiraling compact binaries.

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or {{falling in love with}} humans.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{differentiating}} {{features of}} males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes).

5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians.

5|$|Even {{after all}} Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum.

An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E

It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female will either submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds.|$|E
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods.
