40|$|Abstract. In the {{presence}} of sunk costs <b>to</b> <b>exporting,</b> preferential tariff liberalization may have a prolonged, dynamic effect on the pattern of a beneficiary country’s exports. In particular, when preferential market access helps overcome product specific fixed costs <b>to</b> <b>exporting,</b> preferential tariff liberalization might trigger a geographic spread of <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> third markets outside the preferential trading area. I test this hypothesis for the pattern of Mexican exports between 1993 – 1997, after the inception of NAFTA, to several Latin American and European trading partners, respectively. After controlling for product specific shocks and the overall trend in export growth, the evidence {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that initial <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the United States further prompted <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> third markets.

40|$|This book {{presents}} new original {{research on}} the main impediments <b>to</b> <b>exports</b> facing transition economies. It specifically addresses questions such as: Are the impediments <b>to</b> <b>exports</b> mainly internal and demand related, or are they associated more with the conditions of supply? How are governments promoting exports now that their influence over enterprise activity has been reduced? What strategies have enterprises developed to overcome existing barriers <b>to</b> <b>exports?</b> And what role does investment play {{in the development of}} competitive export potential? The authors focus on the export performance of eight small transition economies with special emphasis on the behavior of exporting enterprises. Results of the analysis reveal that in the mid- 1990 s the companies' inherited conditions and their strategies, as well as the domestic economic situation, are more important in determining export performance than characteristics of demands abroad. The authors conclude that exports have {{played a key role in}} the transition economies' recent recovery from recession and that further dismantling of remaining impediments will be critical as these economies become more integrated with the Western World. The book will be essential for policy makers, governments and private sector business as well as for academics who analyze trade developments in Central and Eastern Europe and propose relevant policies to tackle impediments <b>to</b> <b>exports...</b>|$|R
