5|$|In 1969, {{the fiftieth}} anniversary of Kappa Kappa Psi, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> {{performers}} to create two bands. The National Intercollegiate Symphonic Band, the top ensemble, {{was conducted by}} Norman Dello Joio and premiered his new work, Songs of Abelard. The Symphonic Band also performed several other Dello Joio works, including Scenes from the Louvre, Variants on a Mediaeval Tune, and Fantasies on a Theme by Haydn. The National Intercollegiate Concert Band was conducted by Past Grand President Jay L. Slaughter, and performed Makovksy's Kappa Kappa Psi march and several other works.|$|E
5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} {{remedial legislation}} to override Manitoba, {{but they were}} blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes {{at the end of}} the day if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He said that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised {{and said that the}} game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E

25|$|Under California law, any elected {{official}} {{may be the}} target of a recall campaign. To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office. For the 2003 recall election, that meant a minimum of 897,156 signatures, based on the November 2002 statewide elections, but 1.2 million were needed to ensure that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> valid signatures.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} times, the Reverend John Jay Hughes, among {{a few other}} Roman Catholic writers, {{concluded}} that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> flaws in and ambiguity surrounding the pope's apostolic letter to merit re-examination {{of the question of}} the invalidity of Anglican holy orders. Father Hughes himself had previously been an Anglican priest and was subsequently conditionally (sub conditione) ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. Other Anglican theological critics argued that apostolic succession had never been broken in the first place, due to valid ordinations tracing back to Archbishop Laud and beyond to Archbishop Parker.|$|E
