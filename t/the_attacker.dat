5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> is moving is its looming, the change in size as <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of <b>the</b> <b>attacker,</b> and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> {{consciously}} stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is normally the practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E
50|$|When {{the local}} {{security}} team arrived, {{at first they}} mistook <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> for IDF soldiers and called out to them. Responder Arik Becker {{was killed in the}} initial round of gunfire. Israeli police joined the security team, causing <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to flee. Ya’akov Katz was killed in a burst of gunfire while <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were running through <b>the</b> streets. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> fled {{through a hole in the}} security fence in the direction of the village of Tuffah. One of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> was later killed by IDF troops.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> used a {{satellite}} phone {{and cell phones}} {{to talk to each}} other as well as their handlers that were based in Pakistan. [...] In transcripts intercepted by Indian authorities between <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> and their handlers, the handlers provided <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> with encouragement, tactical advice, and information gained from media coverage. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> used both personal cell phones and those obtained from their victims to communicate with each other and the news media. Although <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were encouraged to murder hostages, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done in order to further confuse Indian authorities that they were dealing with primarily a hostage situation.|$|R
50|$|Several {{hours after}} the attack, a wake and {{symbolic}} funeral with hundreds of attendees was held for <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> in <b>the</b> Al-Porkan mosque in Umm al-Fahm, which is affiliated with the Islamic Movement in Israel and in which <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> prayed, in which <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were praised and called Shahids.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{two girls}} {{were killed in}} Ramle by shots fired at a hall where Itzhak Abergil was celebrating. Police believe the slain girls were {{innocent}} victims of a mistake by <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> in identifying his true target.|$|E
5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetric}} key is randomly generated {{and will not}} assist other victims. At no point is the attacker's private key exposed to victims and the victim need only send a very small ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric-cipher key) to <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two UN {{security}} guards responded and fired pistols at <b>the</b> <b>attackers,</b> while 25 {{of the guests}} escaped {{out the back of}} the house. One UN security guard, an American from Miami named Louis Maxwell, climbed to the roof of the building to fire at <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b> Maxwell and <b>the</b> other security guard, Laurance Mefful from Ghana, were able to prevent <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> from entering <b>the</b> building for almost one hour. Maxwell and Mefful were then reportedly killed by <b>the</b> <b>attackers,</b> although later reports suggest Maxwell was wounded but survived the confrontation, only to be executed by Afghan policemen responding to <b>the</b> attack. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> then apparently approached the building. Two of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were killed by gunfire from unknown sources and the third detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and at least two guests who had not evacuated the building.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> {{surviving}} <b>attackers</b> turned {{themselves over}} to the PA, the Palestinian Authority announced {{that they would not}} extradite <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to Israel. On January 22, 2008 <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were convicted in a Palestinian military court and sentenced to 15 years in prison each.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> {{came from}} a village (Bovensmilde) where {{a few years later}} a primary school was seized. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> hid their weapons {{disguised}} as presents for the Sinterklaas holiday on December 5.|$|R
5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} unauthorized network intrusion. A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b> Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|A {{man named}} Gianni Schicchi is only briefly {{referred}} to in Dante's Inferno Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another. Dante is told that <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> is Schicchi, condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati and making his will highly favorable to Schicchi.|$|E
5|$|Not {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>attacker,</b> {{nine people}} were killed and six others were seriously wounded in the attack. Seven of the dead were Americans working for the CIA. One was al-Balawi's Jordanian case officer and another was the Afghan in charge of external security for the base who had driven al-Balawi to the base from the Pakistan border.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> {{then moved}} on to the Emmett mine, about half a mile away and outside of town, where in {{addition}} to dynamite and gunfire, they used a home-made cannon to fire shrapnel at the shaft house. The cannon blew a hole in the defensive wall, and <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> tried to rush through the breach, but were driven back by gunfire from <b>the</b> strikebreakers. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> again tried to rupture the boiler fuel tank at the Emmett, but without success. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> finally withdrew, leaving one of their number at the scene, killed by gunfire. The El Paso, and R.A.M. mines were also attacked that night, but without casualties or damage. All four of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> who died were identified as members of the Western Federation of Miners.|$|R
30|$|This type {{of attack}} is {{possible}} {{both on the}} USB channel and <b>the</b> Network. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> launch <b>the</b> channel-breaking attack by eavesdropping the network where the data being transferred. It might be possible for <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to intercept <b>the</b> data in transit. However, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{would not be able}} to read the data. The network between the device user and the bank application server is protected by SSL. The network between the device user and the privacy CA is protected by the encryption using a private part of the AIK that never leaves the TPM chip inside the device. Without having an owner secret, it is not possible for <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to be able to decrypt the data because <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> will never be able to get the appropriate AIK private key.|$|R

5|$|Nxumalo {{frequently}} fights {{the racism}} and apartheid that {{is beginning to}} creep into his hometown. He tries to tackle stories important to his society's well-being. However, he is no match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown. Constantly harassed by the government, {{at the end of}} the film he is stabbed to death. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> has never been identified.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 2015, Microsoft {{released}} a security update to mitigate a security vulnerability in BitLocker that allowed authentication to be bypassed by employing a malicious Kerberos key distribution center, if <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> had physical {{access to the}} machine, the machine was part of domain and had no PIN or USB protection.|$|E
5|$|On an {{international}} airline flight, an African man enters the bathroom, {{where he is}} attacked by a man exhibiting albino traits. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> leaves the bathroom with his normal black skin tone. Before the plane lands in the United States, a flight attendant discovers the victim in the bathroom, devoid of his skin pigmentation.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June, the BBC {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were from <b>the</b> Russian North Caucasus region, [...] Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Previously {{it was reported}} <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> spoke a language unfamiliar to their taxi driver, possibly Chechen. CNN {{reported that}} the gunmen were from the two Central Asian countries and Russia. Turkey has identified two of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> as Russian nationals Rakim Bulgarov and Vadim Osmanov, while not identifying the third.|$|R
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indications}} that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{had been taking}} steroids. The gunman who survived said that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> had used Google Earth to familiarise themselves with the locations of buildings used in the attacks.|$|R
2500|$|After the van {{crashed on}} Borough High Street, <b>the</b> three <b>attackers</b> ran to Stoney Street {{adjoining}} Borough Market, where they stabbed {{four people in}} the Borough Bistro pub. Bottles and chairs were thrown at <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{by members of the}} public. Witness claimed that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were shouting [...] "This is for Allah".|$|R
5|$|Six weeks later, Binky was {{involved}} in another mauling. Drunken local teenagers approached the bear's enclosure, apparently hoping to swim in its pool, and one 19-year-old was hospitalized with leg lacerations after he was mauled. The zoo did not confirm that Binky was <b>the</b> <b>attacker,</b> but the bear had blood on his face following the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} file {{encrypting}} ransomware was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and {{was presented at}} the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and it was inspired by the fictional facehugger in the movie Alien. Cryptoviral extortion is the following three-round protocol carried out between <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> and the victim.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
50|$|Later on the Shin Bet {{claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> ambushed <b>the</b> {{travelers}} in the wadi, {{in order to}} carry out the attack. When one of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> spotted <b>the</b> travelers approaching the wadi he immediately reported it to his <b>the</b> other <b>attackers,</b> whom came over and assisted him carrying out the attack.|$|R
5000|$|After the van {{crashed on}} Borough High Street, <b>the</b> three <b>attackers</b> ran to Stoney Street {{adjoining}} Borough Market, where they stabbed {{four people in}} the Borough Bistro pub. Bottles and chairs were thrown at <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{by members of the}} public. Witness claimed that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were shouting [...] "This is for Allah".|$|R
5000|$|Push: The attacking team must capture three {{territorial}} {{objectives in}} sequential order. For every objective captured, more reinforcements are made available {{and more time}} is given to capture the next objective. The defenders must protect the objectives from <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> are able to capture all three objectives, they must find and destroy the cache. At this point, the defenders only have one life to fend off <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b> <b>The</b> game ends when either team runs out of reinforcements and players.|$|R
5|$|Ueshiba's senior {{students}} have {{different approaches to}} aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found {{all over the world}} in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} to the Excelsis Dei private nursing home in Worcester, Massachusetts in order to {{investigate}} a nurse's claim that she was raped by an invisible entity. Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) claims that she knows who was responsible and names <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei. When questioned, Arden admits that he made sexual overtures to her, but claims that it was harmless {{and that he is}} too elderly to have done anything.|$|E
5000|$|Power - if the {{defending}} player loses, he must remove {{a number of}} power tokens from his House card equal to the claim value on <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> plot, and place them on <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> House card.|$|R
50|$|Each leg brought <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> {{artillery}} closer {{until the}} besieged cannon would be sufficiently suppressed for <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to breach <b>the</b> walls. Broadly speaking, sappers were originally experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.|$|R
5000|$|As late as 3 December 2008, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari {{and other}} Pakistani {{officials}} declared {{that they had}} seen no evidence that <b>the</b> Mumbai <b>attackers</b> were from Pakistan, and {{that they did not}} believe <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were from Pakistan. Later, they maintained that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were [...] "non-state actors" [...] unconnected with the Pakistani military or ISI.|$|R
