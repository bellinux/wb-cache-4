50|$|Just to {{the north}} of Prinz is a system of rilles {{designated}} the Rimae Prinz. These are sinuous in nature and extend for up to 80 kilometers. The <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> Vera is only a couple of kilometers {{to the north}} of Prinz's rim, and serves as the origin of one of these rilles. Within the same rille complex is the <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> Ivan. The crater Vera was previously identified as Prinz A, and Ivan as Prinz B, before they were assigned names by the IAU.|$|E

50|$|Green Lake {{is one of}} two <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> lakes on Raoul Island in the Kermadec Islands, {{the other}} being Blue Lake. It covers an area of about 0.5 km². It erupted on 17 March 2006, killing Department of Conservation worker Mark Kearney, who was there taking lake {{temperature}} measurements.|$|E
50|$|The oval-shaped Anders G intrudes {{slightly}} {{into the}} southeast rim of Anders. There {{is a tiny}} double-crater formation attached to {{the exterior of the}} northeast rim, and a short valley cuts into the northern wall. The interior floor is relatively flat, and is marked only by a <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> on the eastern wall.|$|E
50|$|This is a sinuous rille {{centered}} on selenographic coordinates 31.0° N, 32.0° W. It occupies a maximum diameter of 60 km. Three <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> {{in the vicinity}} of this feature have been assigned names by the IAU. These are listed in the table below.|$|R
50|$|This linear {{string of}} 23 <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> {{runs from the}} {{midpoint}} of Davy Y towards the walled basin Ptolemaeus, following a slightly curving course to the east-northeast. It is located at selenographic coordinates 11.0° S, 7.0° W, and has a diameter of 50 km.|$|R
50|$|A pair of <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> just to {{the south}} of Mons Esam have been {{assigned}} names by the IAU. These are listed in the table below. The craters are at the tops of two lunar domes, which are most likely volcanoes and were not formed by impacts.|$|R
50|$|This crater has a {{worn and}} rounded outer rim, forming a {{slightly}} irregular circle. A pair of tiny craterlets lie along the southeast rim, {{and there is}} a narrow cleft in the northern wall. The interior floor is level and nearly featureless, with only a few <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> pits to mark the surface.|$|E
50|$|Within Patsaev Q is a <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> {{that was}} officially {{designated}} Kira by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Kira is a Russian feminine name - the crater is not actually named for any specific person. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 17.6° S, 132.8° E, and the diameter is 3 km.|$|E
50|$|The outer rim of this crater {{is roughly}} circular, {{with a slight}} outward {{protrusion}} along the southern side. The rim and inner walls are not significantly eroded, and slope downward to a ring of accumulated debris surrounding the interior floor. The bottom is somewhat irregular, with a <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> near the midpoint and another to the northeast.|$|E
50|$|This cleft {{follows a}} {{generally}} east-west path across the Mare Imbrium. It is centered at selenographic coordinates 31.0° N, 32.0° W, {{and has a}} maximum diameter of 150 km. Several <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> near this rille have been assigned names by the IAU. These {{are listed in the}} table below.|$|R
50|$|The rim of Schröter {{is heavily}} worn and eroded, {{with a wide}} gap in the {{southern}} wall and a deep indentation to the southeast. There is no central peak at the crater's midpoint. A widely spaced row of <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> forms a line westwards from the north rim of Schröter.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} half of {{the interior}} floor is level and marked only by a few very tiny craterlets. The southern floor is more irregular due to the overlaying ejecta from Neumayer and Boussingault, and {{is marked by a}} pair of <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> in the southeast. There is no central peak.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> Lassell D {{is located}} to the west-northwest of Lassell, about {{halfway to the}} ruined crater Guericke. This craterlet is {{surrounded}} by a patch of high-albedo surface, and {{is an example of a}} prominent lunar bright patch. The light hue is thought to be an indication of recent formation, at least in lunar geological terms.|$|E
50|$|This crater {{has been}} eroded {{by a long}} history of {{subsequent}} impacts, so that the rim has been worn down and the edge rounded. Several small craterlets lie {{along the edge of the}} rim, and there is a <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> on the interior floor near the east-southeastern rim. The interior floor is somewhat irregular and lacks a central peak at the midpoint.|$|E
50|$|The ancient rim of Arnold {{has been}} worn and rounded by ages of {{subsequent}} bombardment. There is {{a gap in}} the wall to the southwest, marked by the <b>tiny</b> <b>crater</b> Arnold J, and the wall is relatively low along the eastern edge. The northern half of the rim is the most intact, particularly to the northeast where is joins the satellite crater Arnold A.|$|E
50|$|The outer rim of Mairan has {{not been}} {{significantly}} eroded or impacted, and retains a sharp edge. The surface around Mairan is rough and irregular, with a multitude of many <b>tiny</b> <b>craters,</b> particularly {{to the south and}} west. The inner walls display some terracing, and flow down to a relatively flat interior floor.|$|R
50|$|This crater has a raised, {{circular}} rim {{that has}} become worn. The satellite crater Purkyně K intrudes into the southeastern rim. The crater is otherwise only marked {{by a number of}} tiny craterlets. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with only a pair of <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> along the eastern side.|$|R
50|$|The outer rim of Anderson {{is heavily}} worn and eroded. Small craters overlie the southeastern and southwestern rims. The {{interior}} is relatively flat, with multiple <b>tiny</b> <b>craters</b> covering {{parts of the}} floor. The most prominent of these is Anderson L, located near the southeastern rim. Anderson L is also {{commonly known as the}} Anderson Finger.|$|R
