AN OVERVIEW OF <b>THE</b> NEW <b>INSTITUTIONAL</b> ECONOMICS <b>The</b> New <b>Institutional</b> Economics is a large and relatively new multidisciplinary field that includes aspects of economics, history, sociology, political science, business organization and law. Oliver Williamson coined the phrase <b>the</b> “New <b>Institutional</b> Economics ” (Coase, 2000) but it is commonly known that <b>the</b> New <b>Institutional</b> Economics emerged with Coase’s 1937 article “The Nature of the Firm”. This article and his other famous essay “The Problem of Social Cost ” (1960) started what many, including North (2000), {{considered to be a}} revolution in economics. This new direction of economics considers that the cost of transacting – determined by institutions and institutional arrangements – is the key to economic performance. It i...|$|R

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development.
