30|$|This study makes several {{contributions}} to the literature. First, our study expands our understanding of <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> nature of ATPs with firm characteristics and governance environments. While prior studies examine <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of ATPs with each governance force in isolation, we consider the interactions among ATPs, excess cash, industry competition, and large shareholder ownership altogether. 3 Thus, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, our study makes the first attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of such <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> in acquisition events. Our study also contributes to the literature by testing the relationship between ATPs and acquisition performance. <b>The</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> indicates that a test design examining the average effect of ATPs forfeits considerable statistical power. By explicitly modeling <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> nature of <b>the</b> relationship, we improve the statistical power of tests and clarify the inconsistency in the previous literature.|$|R

40|$|Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) systems usually utilize {{one type of}} changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations for control, such as event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and P 300 evoked potentials. There is a recent trend to detect more than one of these signals in one system to create a hybrid BCI. However, in this case, EEG data were always divided into groups and analyzed by the separate processing procedures. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> were ignored when different types of BCI tasks were executed simultaneously. In this work, we propose an improved tensor based multiclass multimodal scheme especially for hybrid BCI, in which EEG signals are denoted as multiway tensors, a nonredundant rank-one tensor decomposition model is proposed to obtain nonredundant tensor components, a weighted fisher criterion is designed to select multimodal discriminative patterns without ignoring <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects,</b> and support vector machine (SVM) is extended to multiclass classification. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can not only identify the different changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations induced by different types of tasks but also capture <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> of simultaneous tasks properly.
