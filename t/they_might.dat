5|$|Why <b>they</b> <b>might</b> do so, {{when there}} was {{apparently}} no reason for them not to escape over the Alps—Spartacus' goal according to Plutarch—is not explained.|$|E
5|$|As a philologist, Tolkien's {{interest}} in languages {{led him to}} invent several languages of his own as a pastime. In considering the nature of who might speak these languages, and what stories <b>they</b> <b>might</b> tell, Tolkien again turned {{to the concept of}} elves.|$|E
5|$|Atangana's {{appointment}} irritated {{members of}} the Bulu ethnic group. They feared <b>they</b> <b>might</b> one day lose German favour, or worse yet, fall under the dominion of the Ewondo. This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus Fibratus clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of cirrus cloud. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> {{indicate}} windy weather, since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Flood was <b>They</b> <b>Might</b> Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although <b>They</b> <b>Might</b> Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E

5|$|Flood was {{the first}} album {{released}} by <b>They</b> <b>Might</b> Be Giants to receive the RIAA Platinum sales award—indicating sales over one million copies—which it achieved on July 10, 2009. It is also certified Gold by the BPI in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|In addition, while <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not {{properly}} be called process philosophers, Whitehead has been {{influential in the}} philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, Milič Čapek, Isabelle Stengers, Bruno Latour, Susanne Langer, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.|$|E
5|$|In short, Cobb {{does not}} {{conceive}} of dialogue as useful primarily to convert or be converted, {{but rather as}} useful in order to transform both parties mutually, allowing for a broadening of ideas and a reimagining of each faith in order that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> better face {{the challenges of the}} modern world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the written}} {{language}} {{and more recently}} also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.

5|$|Promotion for Flood {{included}} television appearances, promotional videos, and {{an international}} tour.

5|$|Scott—still unsure who his {{ships were}} firing at, and afraid that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be firing {{on his own}} destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied.

5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars.
