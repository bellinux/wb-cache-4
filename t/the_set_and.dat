5|$|A women's prison wing {{located in}} the Philadelphia House of Correction doubled for a scene set in an Atlantic City jail. A scene {{depicting}} Birdy and Al climbing an elevated railway was filmed at the 46th Street Station above the intersection of Farragut and Market Street in the Mill Creek neighborhood. The cast and crew then moved to Philadelphia City Hall, where Wilson Goode, the city's first African American mayor, visited <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> gave the production his blessing.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997. It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward. As he performs the chorus, he jumps off <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> walks towards his stage chair, where he sits and observes his surroundings. The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road, as the video fades from view.|$|E

5|$|Before filming began Dorff, Fanning, and Lala Sloatman (who plays Marco's ex-wife) improvised {{meals and}} fights to {{understand}} the family's dynamic. Dorff also collected Fanning from school and they spent an afternoon together to bond. Dorff stayed in the Chateau Marmont during principal photography, {{making it easier to}} get to <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> understand the character. Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon (1973) during production.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's Soup Company {{sponsored}} the entire nineteen-year run of Lassie. In {{one of the}} first instances of product placement, the company asked that their products be visible on <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> so, in episode after episode, Campbell's products are seen in background shots. Campbell's also contractually required the show's stars to avoid appearing in any film or theatrical production that undermined their All-American images.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 shows, {{the song}} usually {{appeared}} midway through <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> featured Billy Preston's synthesizer and a flute solo from Tom Scott {{instead of the}} familiar slide-guitar breaks. Although widely bootlegged, no version of the song from this tour has been released officially.|$|E

5|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} a media tour of part of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> an invitation-only screening sponsored by the publisher of MacGrath's book. The Carpet from Bagdad was released on 3 May 1915 to mostly positive reviews. Many praised the tinted desert scenes and realistic Middle East imagery, although some felt the scenery overshadowed the characters. The film is now mostly lost, although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Set {{designers}} modeled the set for Our World after {{a corner}} news stand. For each episode, artifacts {{of the period}} being profiled, including magazines and political posters, decorated <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> a movie marquee listed {{the title of a}} film that was in theatres of the time. In the foreground was placed an Our World newspaper the headlines of which were the program's title and the name of that program's producer.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the other}} packs, The Trouble with Clones {{contained}} about an hour of gameplay.

5|$|The Swinton {{house was}} {{constructed}} on Stage 16, while Stage 20 {{was used for}} Rouge City and other sets. Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> making actors sign confidentiality agreements. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law applied prosthetic makeup daily {{in an attempt to}} look shinier and robotic. Costume designer Bob Ringwood (Batman, Troy) studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras. Spielberg found post-production on A.I. difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot Minority Report.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} the sound of an {{orchestra}} tuning and Deems Taylor's introduction from Fantasia. Panels showing various segments from Fantasia fly in outer space and form <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> stage for an orchestra. Musicians take their seats and tune up and animators draw at their desks before James Levine approaches the conductor's podium and signals the beginning of the first piece.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by {{vaporizing}} him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E

5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E

In 1951 he designed Sir Alec Guinness's Hamlet and in 1955 All's Well That Ends Well, for Noel Willman.|$|R

5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and {{produced}} the trilogy's music. He {{was hired in}} August 2000 and visited <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives {{in the history of}} cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire Star Wars saga. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve. As a Beatles fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the zebra crossing.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>and</b> watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E
