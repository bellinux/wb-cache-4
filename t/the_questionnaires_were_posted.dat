40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2003 the Swiss {{federation}} of pharmacists organized a campaign "sleep disturbances [...] daytime sleepiness". The {{goal was to}} assist pharmacy clients in detecting likely causes of any sleep disturbance or daytime sleepiness through a free of charge screening, and to deliver targeted counselling. For pharmacy practice there are no screening or triage guidelines to assess the severity of sleep and wakefulness disturbances and potential causes for those disturbances. In this paper {{the outcome of the}} campaign in terms of feasibility, participation, observed response patterns, sale of over-the-counter (OTC) sleeping pills, and counselling activities is evaluated. METHODS: The Stanford sleep disorders questionnaire and the Epworth sleepiness scale served to identify patterns of symptoms suggestive of four major categories of sleep disorders. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> <b>posted</b> on a web-site and the clients' data were entered online in the pharmacies. A report was automatically generated and immediately available online to the pharmacists. The pharmacists documented separately their counselling activities in a pharmacist's activity report. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty-two (23 %) of 2743 pharmacy clients had response patterns suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea, 418 (15 %) of restless-legs-syndrome, 39 (1 %) of a sleep disorder potentially associated with a psychiatric condition and 79 (3 %) of narcolepsy. An Epworth sleepiness score > 10 points was found in 567 (21 %). After screening, 2345 (86 %) pharmacy clients received targeted counselling. Only 216 (8 %) purchased an OTC sleeping pill and 704 (26 %) were recommended to consult a physician, but of these, 446 (63 %) were already under medical supervision. CONCLUSIONS: The online screening tool for sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness was successfully introduced in Swiss pharmacies. Pharmacies were able to assess the pattern of individual sleep disorders and to identify a possible cause in nearly one-third of the cases...|$|E

For this we realized an empirical study within the Arad county space, having as main objective {{the identification of the}} managers’ perception regarding the usefulness of accounting information and of other factors considered when making decisions. Another aspect was to interpret the managers’ tendency towards manipulation or strategic management of results. The empirical research was carried out between December 2013 and January 2014, and the research method used was the survey, and as an instrument of the research we used the questionnaire. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> <b>posted</b> on a website but some of them were applied directly in the field to ensure a response rate of at least 30 %. For the analysis and confirmation of the feasibility of the questionnaire and of the measurement scale, we used Cronbach Alpha method. The results obtained after statistically processing the answers received from respondents and after testing the research hypotheses show that there is an increased interest of the managers from the investigated Arad firms {{to improve the quality of}} the financial accounting information and to give the users as beautiful an image as possible of the company’s performances; it is noticed their inclination to the manipulation of the accounting figures. On the other hand the results obtained demonstrate that, despite the fact that most of the managers from the sample consider that using ethics is a priority in making decisions, this idea is not an obstacle for more than a half to change an accounting policy that would affect the true image but would be favorable to the image of the company The utility of such research contributes to the insurance of the premises for the development of future research, looking to test the reaction of the professional accountants in our country, regarding the phenomenon of creative accounting...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Low {{achievement}} in Mathematics {{is a problem}} that faces schools, colleges and universities, not only in South Africa, but worldwide. Many efforts have been made to explore different ways in which teaching and learning can be more effective. ICT provides endless possibili–ties to enhance the teaching and learning of Mathematics. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine teacher–students’ attitude towards ICTs in order to plan for effective, efficient and appropriate methods of Mathematics education. It further aims to determine to what extent these students will be willing to use ICTs in their own studies as well as in the teaching pro–cess in their classrooms, and aims to compare the students’ attitudes across three countries i. e. South Africa, Tanzania and Finland. The population consisted of Mathematics education teacher–students enrolled at the following institutions: School for Continuing Teacher Educa–tion (SCTE) at the North–West University in South Africa (317 students), the Iringa University College, University of Tumaini in Tanzania (111 students), and the University of Joensuu in Finland (56 students). This study followed a quantitative cross–sectional survey design com–prising a single mode research questionnaire to three groups of students in three countries. The instrument that was used was based on the Loyd and Gressard Computer Attitude Sur–vey (1984) (CAS), with a few additional questions to add to the relevance of this study. Questionnaires were completed by each group of students. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> <b>posted</b> to each Mathematics teacher–student at the SCTE with a return envelope included. The re–searcher visited Tanzania and administered the questionnaire to the students at their univer–sity and some students in Finland completed the survey online while others completed a pa–per–based copy, which was returned to the researcher. Descriptive statistical techniques, reliability and validity of the instrument scale, inferential statistics (ANOVA), and cross–tabulations were used, and where appropriate, effect sizes were calculated. Findings indi–cated that the teacher–students have a positive attitude to computers and that they are willing to use ICTs in their own studies and in their teaching at school. The comparison of their atti–tudes revealed that the South African and Tanzanian teacher–students have a more positive attitude towards ICTs than the Finnish students. The teacher–students in the two African countries were also more willing to use ICTs than the students in Finland, despite their in–creased exposure and access to technology. To create an environment of effective Mathe–matics education, a number of factors play an important role. Mathematics education sup–ported by good pedagogical content knowledge can be transformed into effective Mathemat–ics education with the aid of a positive computer attitude and willingness to use technology. Together these aspects are supported by the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) framework. Master...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between the severity of Tourette Syndrome (TS) and comorbid tendencies (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and rage), maternal differential treatment, fairness evaluation of maternal differential treatment, and communication with both sibling and family relationships. Fifty-five mothers and healthy siblings of individuals with Tourette Syndrome participated in the study. The parents provided information regarding family demographics and the severity of Tourette Syndrome and comorbid tendencies, and the healthy siblings completed the sibling and family relationship questionnaires. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> <b>posted</b> on a secure website, where the parents and healthy siblings could complete the online measures via internet connections. The study revealed several important findings. The results showed significant associations between the severity of Tourette Syndrome and comorbid OCD, ADHD and rage tendencies thus suggesting that studying Tourette Syndrome without considering comorbidity would be unrealistic. Additionally, communication regarding Tourette Syndrome between the healthy siblings and their parents {{played an important role}} with respect to sibling and family relationships. Communication between the healthy siblings and their parents predicted more warmth between the healthy siblings and their sibling with Tourette Syndrome as well as more family cohesion and adaptability as reported by the healthy siblings. Communication had a significant moderating effect on both severity of Tourette Syndrome and healthy siblings' fairness evaluation of maternal differential treatment in predicting family relationships. When the sibling had less severe Tourette Syndrome, the healthy siblings reported more family adaptability when they had more communication with their parents, and reported less family adaptability when they had less communication with their parents. The results also indicated that when healthy siblings perceived their maternal differential treatment to be unfair, they reported more family cohesion when they had more communication with their parents, and reported less family cohesion when they had less communication with their parents. The study did not support the negative impact of maternal differential treatment on sibling relationships; however, the results confirmed the previous findings regarding the moderating effect of fairness evaluation on maternal differential treatment in predicting sibling relationships. When the sibling with Tourette Syndrome was favored, the healthy siblings reported more sibling warmth when they perceived the favouritism (maternal differential treatment) to be fair. Furthermore, the results showed that healthy siblings' perceptions of maternal differential treatment could predict cohesion and adaptability in the family. The more the healthy siblings reported being treated differently by their mothers, the less cohesion and adaptability they reported in their families. The present study supported previous studies in finding that sibling conflict decreased with age. The results also highlighted the role of age in moderating the effects of communication and maternal differential treatment in predicting sibling conflict. When healthy siblings had more communication with their parents they reported more conflict with their sibling with Tourette Syndrome when they were younger, and reported less sibling conflict with their sibling with Tourette Syndrome when they were older. Furthermore, when healthy siblings were favored by their mothers, they reported more conflict with their sibling with Tourette Syndrome when they were younger than when they were older, thereby emphasizing the importance of developmental differences in dynamics between the siblings. The significant contributions of the study include underlining the importance of communication, the relationship between Tourette Syndrome and comorbid conditions, and healthy siblings' perceptions of sibling and family relationships...|$|E

Despite this evidence, communication within the physiotherapy profession is still underexplored, in particular, how ‘best’ to open clinical encounters. This study explores the issue by seeking the preferences of physiotherapists for opening encounters in the adult musculoskeletal outpatient setting. Initially, 42 consultations and 17 first follow-up encounters were observed between qualified physiotherapists and patients with back pain. These encounters were audio-recorded, analysed and used to develop a questionnaire to determine clinicians' preferences for opening encounters. From these findings, a synopsis of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> on <b>the</b> four most-relevant professional networks of the national, interactive Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (iCSP) website, to canvass opinion more widely.

A <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> developed, using <b>the</b> Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), to measureGMPs attitudes to and screening for oral cancer. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> designed using all the key theoretical constructs of the TPB and incorporating the themes identified in a qualitative elicitation study. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> to 499 GPs in Surrey Primary Care trust. Results. Two hundred and twenty-eight completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> returned (46 %). Two TPB constructs [subjective norm (e. g. peer pressure) and perceived external control factors (e. g. adequate equipment, time constraints) ] were identified as significant predictors of ‘intention’ to perform oral screening. Intention and perceived internal control factors (e. g. self-efficacy) were predictive of actually performing oral screening with patients. Conclusions. The results of the study suggest that there is considerable potential for improving intention to perform oral cancer screening in general practice. Theory-based interventions could include further training to enhance confidence, expertise, knowledge and ease of examination, the provision of adequate equipment in the surgery and increasing the motivation to comply with significant others by introducing guidelines on opportunistic screening...|$|R

A questionnaire-based survey research was carried out and <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> to all <b>the</b> 235 listed companies under the Colombo Stock Exchange and 104 had responded. The median turnover was Rs. 505 million with a maximum of Rs. 21, 079 million and a minimum of Rs. 62 million. In terms of years in existence, there are very young companies (age 3 years) as well as very old companies (age 100 years) with a median of 15 years. In {{terms of the number}} of employees, there were small companies (141 employees) and very big companies (23, 000 employees) with a median of 380 employees. On average, the companies spend about 6. 6 % of their turnover on CSR related activities, including training, research and community work. However, sustainability/CS R reporting, environmental auditing and community liaisons are weak, with less than one-forth of the companies having community liaison committees, reporting sustainability/CSR and conducting environmental auditing. CSR activities and financial performance show significant correlations only in few relationships. Only employee relations and customer/supplier relations show significant positive correlations with financial performance. In addition to these two, community relations also show a significant positive correlation with perceived benefits of CSR. When three financial indices are considered separately, it is evident that return on sales has the strongest correlations with CSR activities and the weakest correlation with return on equity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gain insight into the current {{diabetes}} management practices of endurance ath-letes with type 1 diabetes and to compare these practices with the guidelines for athletes established by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Methods Participants included in this descriptive study were endurance athletes aged 18 years and older with type 1 diabetes. The survey questions were based on the current clinical recommendations for endurance athletes with type 1 diabetes, as established by the ADA. A link to <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> on <b>the</b> Web site of the Diabetes Exercise and Sports Association (DESA). A total of 38 questions were included in the survey, and 91 usable surveys were received. Analysis of variance was used for several comparisons using SPSS version 17. Results Half of the clinical guidelines were followed by the par-ticipants. Among these, about 50 % followed many of the guidelines “most of the time ” or “almost always ” and 40 % followed the guidelines “sometimes ” or “most of the time. ” Results of ANOVA showed several trends (nonsignificant) in the occurrence of low blood glucose when the guidelines were not followed. Conclusion Endurance athletes with type 1 diabetes do not consis-tently follow the clinical guidelines for blood glucose management as recommended by the ADA.

40|$|Background: aim - {{to survey}} members of Diabetes UK who had Type 2 {{diabetes}} and who used self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), to elicit {{their views on}} its usefulness {{in the management of}} their diabetes, and how they used <b>the</b> results. A <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> developed for <b>the</b> Diabetes UK website. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> on <b>the</b> Diabetes UK website until over 500 people had responded. Questions asked users to specify the benefits gained from SMBG, and how these benefits were achieved. We carried out both quantitative analysis and a thematic analysis for the open ended free-text questions. Findings: 554 participants completed the survey, of whom 289 (52. 2 %) were male. 20 % of respondents were recently diagnosed (< 6 months). Frequency of SMBG varied, with 43 % of participants testing between once and four times a day and 22 % testing less than once a month or for occasional periods. 80 % of respondents reported high satisfaction with SMBG, and reported feeling more 'in control' of their diabetes management using it. The most frequently reported use of SMBG was to make adjustments to food intake or confirm a hyperglycaemic episode. Women {{were significantly more likely to}} report feelings of guilt or self-chastisement associated with out of range readings (p = <. 001). Conclusion: SMBG was clearly of benefit to this group of confirmed users, who used the results to adjust diet, physical activity or medications. However many individuals (particularly women) reported feelings of anxiety and depression associated with its use. <br/...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a patient reported instrument for {{the measurement of}} patient safety related experiences and outcomes in Primary Care. Method: The instrument was developed in a multistage process supported by an international expert panel and informed by a systematic review of instruments, a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies, four patient focus groups, 18 cognitive interviews and a pilot study. The trial version of Patient Reported Experiences and Outcomes of Safety in Primary Care (PREOS-PC) covered five domains (11 scales) : practice activation (1); patient activation (1); experiences of patient safety (1); harm (6); and general perceptions of patient safety (2). <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> to 6, 736 patients in 45 practices across England. We used “gold standard” psychometric methods to evaluate its acceptability, reliability, structural and construct validity, and ability to discriminate among practices. Results: 1, 244 (18. 4 %) completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> returned. Median item-specific response rate was 91. 3 % (interquartile range 28. 0 %). No major ceiling/floor effects were observed. All six multi-item scales showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0. 75 - 0. 96). Factor analysis, correlation between scales, and known group analyses generally supported structural and construct validity. The scales demonstrated a heterogeneous ability to discriminate between practices. The final version of PREOS-PC consisted in five domains, eight scales and 58 items. Conclusions: PREOS-PC is a new multi-dimensional patient safety instrument for primary care developed with experts and patients. Initial testing shows its potential for use in primary care and future developments will further address its use in actual clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Background: The cytologic {{diagnosis}} of atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) is controversial because {{of variation in}} how it is applied in practice, as well as uncertainty about patient management. We aimed to assess the percentage of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) with AUS/FLUS diagnoses in different North American and European practice settings (e. g. community, academic, etc.), assess whether patients were managed according to current guidelines, and determine patient outcomes. Materials and Methods: A detailed <b>questionnaire</b> survey <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> in secure websites used separately by cytopathologists and cytotechnologists. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> <b>posted</b> from August 1 through December 31, 2013. Results: Endocrinologists and cytopathologists performed 51. 7 % and 37. 1 % of thyroid FNABs, respectively. The Bethesda reporting system for thyroid FNAB was used in 90 % of practices. The rate of AUS/FLUS varied widely among institutions, with 46. 1 % of represented institutions reporting AUS/FLUS rates of 3 - 10 %. The median follow-up rate of patients with an initial AUS/FLUS diagnosis was 70 % (range, 10 - 100 %). For the majority of represented institutions (86. 4 %), patients with initial AUS/FLUS diagnosis had follow-up with endocrinologists. Of repeat AUS/FLUS thyroid FNABs, a median of 52 % was considered benign, and 18 % were suspicious of or positive for malignancy (median, 10 % and 7. 5 %, respectively). Conclusions: Reporting of the AUS/FLUS category varied widely among different institutions. The median follow-up rate was lower than published guidelines. The most common follow-up diagnosis was benign thyroid nodule. Improved standardization of cytologic criteria should be adopted to reduce such variation...|$|R
