5|$|Along its path, Goni killed 74people {{and left}} $831.7million (USD) in damage. On Guam, {{one of the}} first landmasses affected, heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding and power outages.

The typhoon also brought heavy rainfall and rough seas <b>to</b> <b>Taiwan</b> and the east coast of China. In the southern Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu, high wind overturned vehicles, damaged buildings, and left over 490,000homes without power. Off the coast of Kyushu, a man drowned amid high waves.

5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated <b>to</b> <b>Taiwan</b> in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
