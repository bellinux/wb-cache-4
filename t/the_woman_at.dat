Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care}} of The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens {{the back door of the}} van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|Edward and Karl find {{a fork in}} {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected. There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman.

5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E

25|$|Although {{women had}} been enrolling at MIT since the 1880s, they {{constituted}} a tiny minority of the total undergraduate population and lived in a town house across the river. In 1959, MIT released a report, <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>at</b> MIT, which outlined the need to expand residential and social opportunities for female students.

25|$|Ziegler's {{presence}} allows Kubrick {{to change}} {{the mechanics of the}} story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.|$|E
500|$|Musical styles {{from abroad}} have been merged with {{pre-existing}} Malagasy musical traditions to create distinctly Malagasy sounds with foreign roots. [...] An {{example of this}} is the Afindrafindrao, a tune based on the French quadrille that was popularized in the Malagasy court in the 19th century. [...] A specific form of partner dance accompanies this piece, in which dancers will form a long chain of male-female pairs with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the front of each pair, both facing forward holding each other's hands while advancing to the rhythm of the music. [...] From its origins as a courtly dance, the afindrafindrao today is a quintessentially Malagasy tradition performed {{at the beginning of a}} social event or concert to kick off the festivities.|$|E
500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the center of the charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, {{from the perspective of a}} 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{element in}} Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, [...] "you {{look at the}} image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical." [...] In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added [...] "a hint of the steam [...] and the screaming kids", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies [...] "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise [...] "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order". Mulholland Drives ending with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> Club Silencio whispering {{is an example of}} Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, [...] "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." ...|$|E
