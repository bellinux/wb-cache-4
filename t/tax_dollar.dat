25|$|To ease jail {{overcrowding}} over 10 counties {{every year}} consider building new jails. As an example Lubbock County, Texas {{has decided to}} build a $110million megajail to ease jail overcrowding. Jail costs an average of $60 a day nationally. In Broward County, Florida supervised pretrial release costs about $7 a day per person while jail costs $115 a day. The jail system costs a quarter of every county <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> in Broward County, and is the single largest expense to the county taxpayer.|$|E
25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> paid than does the average single person – {{no matter what the}} gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|E
500|$|The {{percentage}} of federal budget that NASA has been allocated {{has been steadily}} dropping since the Apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at 0.48% of the federal budget. In a March 2012 meeting of the United States Senate Science Committee, Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that [...] "Right now, NASA’s annual budget is half a penny on your <b>tax</b> <b>dollar.</b> For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow." ...|$|E

40|$|Alternative funding {{approaches}} affect stated preferences. An individual’s {{willingness to}} reallocate existing <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> exceeds {{willingness to pay}} new taxes to conserve land. However, stated preferences also imply a non-zero opportunity cost to existing tax dollars; different income groups reveal statistically equivalent marginal utilities both for income and for reallocating <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> Yet individuals with lower income show a relatively larger increase in their willingness to support land conservation, when the choice shifts from new taxes to reallocation of existing <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> The paper encourages consideration of equity implications that may be obscured when analysts focus on willingness to pay. ...|$|R

McCallion said [...] "Flaherty has stated in the media {{that some of the}} municipalities have not kept up with infrastructure and did not establish adequate reserves. Well, I can tell him that he is dead wrong. The facts are that Mississauga has carefully set aside reserves for infrastructure for years." [...] McCallion noted that cities are trying to maintain 58 per cent of public infrastructure with eight cents of every <b>tax</b> <b>dollar.</b> Flaherty did not accept Hazel McCallion's offer to debate.|$|E

On October 31, Milliken issued a challenge to county Democrats: [...] "I, for one, have grown weary of waiting for any major Democratic candidate in this election to make his or her position known on Bill Green's plan to cut up Delaware County for congressional elections. The only safeguard against annexation, political or otherwise, is an overwhelming Republican victory at the polls Tuesday." [...] Republican candidate for county prothonotary, Howard Reed, called the Green plan {{the first step to}} eventual total annexation of the county by Philadelphia.

The report found that from 1993 to 2013, [...] "the annual number of overnight leisure travelers to Philadelphia increased by 84 percent" [...] and Visit Philadelphia was credited for about two-thirds of that increase. The report contrasted this to business travel (the responsibility of PHLCVB), which was [...] "essentially flat since 1997." [...] The report, found, however, that PHLCVB had a better return on investment ("$74 for each <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> spent as opposed to $69 per <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> spent by Visit Philadelphia") because business travelers tend {{to spend more than}} tourists.|$|E
