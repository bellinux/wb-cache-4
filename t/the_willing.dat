5|$|After this, the Cosmic Egg Stadium is {{consumed}} by an Idolasphere portal. Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals {{himself to be}} <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa. The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find {{the pieces of the}} Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King Marth, a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeat Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories restored and Medeus gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.|$|E
5|$|In 1761, Alexander Dalrymple, {{an officer}} of the British East India Company, {{concluded}} an agreement with the Sultan of Sulu to allow him to set up a trading post {{for the first time in}} northern Borneo, although this was to prove a failure. Following the British occupation of Manila in 1763, the British freed the Sultan Alimuddin from Spanish colonisers and allowed him to return to his throne; this was welcomed by the Sulu people and by 1765, Dalrymple managed to obtain the island, having concluded a Treaty of Alliance and Commerce with the Sultan of Sulu by <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> of Sultan Alimuddin as a sign of gratitude for the British aid. A small British factory was then established in 1773 on Balambangan Island, a tiny island situated off the north coast of Borneo. The British saw the island as a suitable location to control the trade route in the East, capable of diverting trade from the Spanish port of Manila and the Dutch port of Batavia especially with its strategic location between the South China Sea and Sulu Sea. But the British abandoned the island two years later when the Sulu pirates began attacking. This forced the British to seek refuge in Brunei in 1774, and to abandon temporarily their attempts to find alternative sites for the factory. Although an attempt was made in 1803 to turn Balambangan into a military station, the British did not re-establish any further trading posts in the region until Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in 1819.|$|E

50|$|When the {{probate court}} determines that the {{doctrine}} applies to a lifetime gift {{made to a}} <b>will</b> beneficiary, <b>the</b> amount beneficiary's gift under <b>the</b> <b>will</b> is reduced by the amount the beneficiary has already received.

Of those 49, only six besides the U.S. contributed troops to the invasion force (the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark), and 33 provided some number of troops to support the occupation after the invasion was complete. Six members have no military, meaning that of the 49, 3 withheld troops completely.|$|E
25|$|Historians, James Huston notes, {{have been}} baffled by {{the role of}} high tariffs in general and have offered {{multiple}} conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and were needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> tools of would-be monopolists. A second schools says the Republicans truly believed tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with balanced growth in every region (as opposed to growth only in the cotton South). A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs because it protected their high wages from European competition.|$|E
50|$|In Tshabalala v Tshabalala, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African law of succession, <b>the</b> <b>will</b> in question comprised two pages, but the commissioner signed only the second page and neglected to sign the first page, which actually contained the contents of <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> <b>will</b> was thus rejected. The testator’s granddaughter (the sole heiress in terms of <b>the</b> <b>will)</b> sought an order from the court declaring <b>the</b> <b>will</b> valid. <b>The</b> court held that <b>the</b> <b>will</b> did not comply with the statutory formalities, and was thus invalid; accordingly the deceased was held to have died intestate.|$|R

25|$|In 1767, the British {{moved the}} {{northern}} boundary to the 32° 22′ north latitude, {{extending from the}} Yazoo to the Chattahoochee River, which included the Natchez District and the Tombigbee District. The appended area included approximately the lower halves of the present states of Mississippi and Alabama. Many new settlers arrived {{in the wake of}} the British garrison, swelling the population. In 1774 the First Continental Congress sent letters inviting West Florida to send delegates, but this proposal was declined as the inhabitants were overwhelmingly Loyalist. During the American War of Independence the Governor of West Florida was Peter Chester. The commander of British forces during the war was John Campbell.

25|$|In 1981, {{under the}} {{chairmanship}} of Sir Billy Snedden, Barassi returned to Melbourne as coach and immediately appointed Robert Flower as captain. In Barassi's first year the team finished last, but this was attributed to working out who <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> players were and the club won some powerful victories {{in the next three}} seasons. There was a distinct revival {{during the middle of the}} 1984 season. The club had lost 6 of its first 7 games but won its next 6, two by large margins. After a powerful win against reigning premiers Hawthorn in round 13, elevating the club to 4th place on the ladder, Barassi's five-year plan seemed close to fruition. However, a loss the following week to eventual premiers Essendon seemed to demoralize the club and they only won two more games.|$|E
25|$|After being abandoned, the German {{shore party}} {{returned}} to Direction Island, placed the territory under German martial law, {{and set up}} weapons on the beach to oppose a potential landing. They witnessed the first stages of the battle, {{but by the time}} the combatants disappeared from view, it was clear that Emden had been seriously damaged, and if she survived, von Müller's priority would be heading to a neutral port to effect repairs. Unlikely to hold the beach against any investigating Allied warships, von Mücke decided to commandeer the 97-ton schooner Ayesha, which had been anchored in the lagoon, and attempt to sail to the neutral Dutch East Indies. With <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> assistance of the station staff, the Germans loaded Ayesha with half the island's food supply, then towed the schooner out of the lagoon with the steam launch that evening.|$|E

25|$|Schopenhauer {{discusses}} suicide at length, {{noting that}} it does not actually destroy <b>the</b> <b>Will</b> or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>Will,</b> which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of <b>the</b> <b>will,</b> one can slowly weaken <b>the</b> individual <b>will</b> {{in a way that is}} far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of <b>the</b> <b>will.</b>|$|R
2500|$|If the decedent {{died with}} a <b>will,</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> usually names an {{executor}} (personal representative), who carries out the instructions {{laid out in}} <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> executor marshals the decedent's assets. If there is no <b>will,</b> or if <b>the</b> <b>will</b> does not name an executor, the probate court can appoint one. Traditionally, the representative of an [...] estate is called an administrator.

500|$|Film critics, {{political}} commentators {{and other}} members of the media have also noted the film's numerous references to events surrounding the George W.

The Homeland Security Advisory System and rendition are also referenced.

500|$|The {{opposite}} {{point of}} view was taken by Robert Kirsch, writing in the Los Angeles Times, who considered Fleming's work {{to be a significant}} point in fiction, saying that the Bond novels [...] "are harbingers of a change in emphasis in fiction which is important." [...] The importance, Kirsch claimed, sprung from [...] "a revolution in taste, a return to qualities in fiction which all but submerged in the 20th-century vogue of realism and naturalism" [...] and the importance was such that they were [...] "comparable... only to the phenomenon of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories". Kirsch also believed that [...] "with Fleming,... we do not merely accept <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> suspension of disbelief, we yearn for it, we hunger for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gradually the South Africans grew {{unwilling to}} help Rhodesia. The {{remaining}} 200 South African policemen transferred {{to help in}} the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement. Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that [...] "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia.

50|$|Ademption by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction of legacies, is a common law doctrine that determines the disposition of property under a <b>will</b> when <b>the</b> testator has made lifetime gifts to beneficiaries named in <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> Under <b>the</b> doctrine, a gift that the maker of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> (<b>the</b> testator) gives during his lifetime to a named beneficiary of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under <b>the</b> <b>will,</b> <b>the</b> amount of the lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under <b>the</b> <b>will.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{focus of}} Francis of Marchia’s {{commentary}} on the Sentences posed in Book II was how <b>the</b> <b>will</b> could act against reason resulting in moral culpability: whether <b>the</b> <b>will</b> could either act prior to, or against rational judgment. Marchia argued that <b>the</b> <b>will</b> is <b>the</b> cause of action. After a judgment is made, <b>the</b> <b>will</b> decides to act either in accordance with that judgment or against it. <b>The</b> <b>will</b> constitutes <b>the</b> middle term between judgment and action. Without it, the judgment would necessitate action, negating the concept of free will and moral culpability. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>will</b> is under a law that obliges it to perform good acts.

500|$|The {{collection}} {{also received}} a review from University of Geneva postdoctoral research fellow in the faculty of law, Steven J. Barela, in the Journal of International Criminal Justice.

He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, [...] "In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners." [...] University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, [...] "Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict". He concluded, [...] " [...] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on <b>the</b> <b>willing</b> use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group".|$|E
