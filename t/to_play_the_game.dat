5|$|The PC game {{featured}} a non-linear plot, non-player characters that each ran {{in their own}} independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not {{require the use of}} a 3D accelerator card <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

His oldest brother, Leandro, retired in 2003 after seven years in the Argentine basketball league, while brother Sebastián has played in both the Argentine local league and in the Spanish 2nd-tier level Liga Española de Baloncesto. Their father Jorge was a coach at a club in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, where Ginóbili learned <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bahía Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan, Ginóbili's love for basketball grew rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Gilbert and Winnick {{struggled}} {{to choose a}} gameplay genre for Maniac Mansion. While visiting relatives over Christmas, Gilbert saw his cousin play , an adventure game by Sierra On-Line. Although he was a fan of text adventures, this was Gilbert's first experience with a graphic adventure, and he used the holiday <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and familiarize himself with the format. As a result, he decided to develop his and Winnick's ideas into a graphic adventure game.|$|E

This variation is suitable for play by mail.|$|E

The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In {{the first round}} of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Keenor had a keen {{interest}} in football, using tennis balls or rags tied together to form a ball, due to the expensive nature of footballs at the time, <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in his local streets. He attended Stacey Road primary school in Adamsdown and captained the school's football team for several years and he was later selected to represent the city of Cardiff's schoolboy team.

5|$|Development for Final Fantasy XII {{began in}} December 2000 and was headed by Final Fantasy Tactics {{director}} Yasumi Matsuno and Final Fantasy IX director Hiroyuki Ito. Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but {{was forced to}} bow out of his roles midway through production due to health concerns. The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa, while Akitoshi Kawazu of SaGa series fame became the game's executive producer. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was disappointed by Matsuno's departure and declined <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> beyond its introduction.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

Snead came in and played {{the remainder of the}} game. The Longhorns fell behind by as much as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> against the Aggies.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Bagan Serai, Perak, to a Malaysian Chinese family.
