Six human subjects tapped with their index finger at a rate of 3 taps/s on a keyswitch across five conditions, one freestyle (FS) and four instructed <b>tapping</b> <b>strategies.</b> The four instructed conditions were to tap on a keyswitch using the finger joint only (FO), the wrist joint only (WO), the elbow joint only (EO), and the shoulder joint only (SO). A single-axis force plate measured the fingertip force. An infra-red active-marker three-dimensional motion analysis system measured the movement of the fingertip, hand, forearm, upper arm and trunk. Inverse dynamics estimated joint torques for the metacarpal-phalangeal (MCP), wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. For FS tapping 27 %, 56 %, and 18 % of the vertical fingertip movement were a result of flexion of the MCP joint and wrist joint and extension of the elbow joint, respectively. During the FS movements the net joint powers between the MCP, wrist and elbow were positively correlated (correlation coefficients between 0. 46 and 0. 76) suggesting synergistic efforts. For the instructed <b>tapping</b> <b>strategies</b> (FO, WO, EO, and SO), correlations decreased to values below 0. 35 suggesting relatively independent control of the different joints. For FS tapping, the kinematic and kinetic data indicate that the wrist and elbow contribute significantly, working in synergy with the finger joints to create the fingertip tapping task. © 2007...|$|R

40|$|Gli {{transcription}} {{factors are}} central effectors of Hedgehog signaling in development and tumorigenesis. Using a tandem affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> <b>strategy</b> and mass spectrometry, {{we have found}} that Gli 1 interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 ϵ, and that Gli 2 and Gli 3 also bind to 14 - 3 - 3 ϵ through homologous sites. This interaction depends on their phosphorylation, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), a known negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling serves as a responsible kinase. A Gli 2 mutant engineered to eliminate this interaction exhibited increased transcriptional activity (2 ∼ 3 ×). Transcriptional repression by 14 - 3 - 3 binding was also observed with Gli 3, when its N-terminal repressor domain was deleted. The phosphorylation sites responsible for the binding to 14 - 3 - 3 are distinct from those required for proteolysis, the known mechanism for PKA-induced repression of Hh signaling. Our data propose a novel mechanism in which PKA down-regulates Hedgehog signaling by promoting the interaction between Gli and 14 - 3 - 3 as well as proteolysis. Given the certain neuronal or malignant disorders in human caused by the abnormality of 17 p 13 encompassing 14 - 3 - 3 ϵ overlap with increased Hh signaling, the Gli- 14 - 3 - 3 interaction may have pathological significance for those human diseases...|$|R
40|$|Tandem {{affinity}} purification (TAP) is {{a generic}} approach for the purification of protein complexes. The key advantage of TAP is the engineering of dual affinity tags that, when {{attached to the}} protein of interest, allow purification of the target protein along with its binding partners through two consecutive purification steps. The tandem tag used in the original method consists of two IgG-binding units of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (ProtA) and the calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP), and it allows for recovery of 20 – 30 % of the bait protein in yeast. When applied to higher eukaryotes, however, this classical TAP tag suffers from low yields. To improve protein recovery in systems other than yeast, we describe herein {{the development of a}} three-tag system comprised of CBP, streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) and hexa-histidine. We illustrate the application of this approach for the purification of human Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), which results in highly efficient binding and elution of bait protein in both purification steps (> 50 % recovery). Combined with mass spectrometry for protein identification, this <b>TAP</b> <b>strategy</b> facilitated the first nonbiased analysis of Btk interacting proteins.

40|$|Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) {{maintain}} dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of {{histories and}} other proteins in vivo, and are {{actively involved in}} the control of gene transcription and other nuclear processes. One mechanism by which functions of these enzymes are regulated operates through differential intracellular compartmentalization. HDAC 4, - 5, - 7 and - 9, the four members of class IIa, shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a manner dependent on specific phosphorylation stimulated by several known kinases, and these deacetylases possess intrinsic nuclear import and export signals for dynamic nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The ability to change their intracellular localization implies that class IIa HDACs have some potential functions in different subcellular compartments. To gain additional insights into this, I first focused on studying the function and regulation of HDAC 4. As a result, I identified protein kinase D 3 as a novel kinase for HDAC 4 and found that this kinase physically interacts with HDAC 4 and stimulates its nuclear export. Then I tried to purify protein complexes of RFXANK and ANKRA 2, two homologous ankyrin-repeat proteins that are known to associate with HDCA 4, using the tandem affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> <b>strategy.</b> The results that I have obtained reveal a novel mechanism for regulating the nuclear export of HDAC 4 and suggest that its cytoplasmic localization may also be indicative of potential cytoplasmic functions rather than just for simple sequestration from its nuclear targets...|$|R

However, the application of such strategies for purifying endogenous Arabidopsis multi-protein complexes {{has not yet been}} reported. Here, we describe an alternative TAP (TAPa) system that successfully allows protein complex purification from Arabidopsis. In our newly generated TAPa tag we have replaced the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site with the more specific and lowtemperature active rhinovirus 3 C protease site. In addition, the second purification step can now be performed through two different affinity tags: a six His repeat or nine copies of a myc repeat. To examine our purification procedure we generated a C-terminal fusion between the TAPa tag and CSN 3, a component of the multiprotein COP 9 signalosome (CSN) complex. Subsequent analysis showed that CSN 3 -TAPa could rescue a csn 3 mutant, and that the components of the CSN complex could be co-purified with CSN 3 -TAPa. As part of our long running interest in light signaling in Arabidopsis we have generated Arabidopsis transgenic lines harboring, both N-terminal and C-terminal TAPa fusions of many different light signaling pathway regulators. Molecular characterization of these transgenic lines showed fusion expression in 88 % of the genes analyzed and that this expression is largely independent of the fusion orientation.

This study employs a cross-disciplinary, regional approach to identify some of the links between patterns of harvest, trade, and conservation of one of South India&# 039;s most heavily harvested resins, Canarium strictum Roxb. (Burseraceae), or black dammar. We focus on indigenous communities in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) and ask: How is C. strictum tapped and is there variation across communities? How is C. strictum resin sold and bought, and what trade routes are involved? What are the impacts of tapping on C. strictum trees and population structure? We carried out interviews and focus-group discussions with harvesters in eight villages in three different regions, and with buyers and traders inside and outside of the NBR. We also established twenty-two 20 x 20 m plots to document population structure. Three broad resin-harvest strategies were identified: collection from natural fissures, tapping using incisions, and tapping using incisions and fire, each practiced in a different region. However, within each strategy there was large variation in tapping frequency and timing, tenure practices, and resin quality. The loss of tree tenure in some areas has led to a higher frequency of tapping and to the production of lower quality, lower value resin. Factors driving changes in both tenure and <b>tapping</b> <b>strategies</b> include rising commercial demand and value, pressure from outside harvesters, changes in livelihood strategies, and habitat destruction. Tapping leads to elevated mortality of C. strictum adults, with fire-tapping have a greater negative impact than tapping with no fire.

By testing patients with focal frontal lesions, Robinson et al. demonstrate that the right lateral prefrontal cortex is crucial for response suppression and strategy generation/use. Verbal initiation, suppression and strategy generation/use are cognitive processes widely held to be supported by the frontal cortex. The Hayling Test was designed to tap these cognitive processes within the same sentence completion task. There are few studies specifically investigating the neural correlates of the Hayling Test {{but it has been}} primarily used to detect frontal lobe damage. This study investigates the components of the Hayling Test in a large sample of patients with unselected focal frontal (n = 60) and posterior (n = 30) lesions. Patients and controls (n = 40) matched for education, age and sex were administered the Hayling Test as well as background cognitive tests. The standard Hayling Test clinical measures (initiation response time, suppression response time, suppression errors and overall score), composite errors scores and strategy-based responses were calculated. Lesions were analysed by classical frontal/posterior subdivisions as well as a finer-grained frontal localization method and a specific contrast method that is somewhat analogous to voxel-based lesion mapping methods. Thus, patients with right lateral, left lateral and superior medial lesions were compared to controls and patients with right lateral lesions were compared to all other patients. The results show that all four standard Hayling Test clinical measures are sensitive to frontal lobe damage although only the suppression error and overall scores were specific to the frontal region. Although all frontal patients produced blatant suppression errors, a specific right lateral frontal effect was revealed for producing errors that were subtly wrong. In addition, frontal patients overall produced fewer correct responses indicative of developing an appropriate strategy but only the right lateral group showed a significant deficit. This problem in strategy attainment and implementation could explain, at least in part, the suppression error impairment. Contrary to previous studies there was no specific frontal effect for verbal initiation. Overall, our results support a role for the right lateral frontal region in verbal suppression and, for the first time, in strategy generation/use...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) -based proteomics {{can be used}} {{to answer}} a diversity of biological questions. In this thesis, we describe the application of several MS-based proteomics approaches to get insight into several aspects of signal transduction. In Chapter 2, quantitative global phosphoproteomics are employed to study phosphorylation events that occur upon activation of the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We identify nearly 18, 000 phosphorylation sites of which 220 are shown to be regulated upon Epac-Rap activation. Bioinformatical analyses reveal that these regulated phosphosites reside in proteins regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell junctions and cell adhesion, which are processes that have previously been linked to Rap. In the Addendum to Chapter 2, we describe a preceding effort to study global phosphorylation events upon Epac activation, using a generated HeLa cell line stably expressing Epac 1. A total of 6, 750 phosphorylation sites are identified and 77 of these displayed regulation upon Epac 1 activation. Further investigation of one of the regulated phosphoproteins, the Rac 1 effector CD 2 -associated protein (CD 2 AP), reveals the requirement of an intact microtubule network in Epac-mediated endothelial barrier function. Chapter 3 focuses more specifically on Epac 1 itself and we describe several MS-based approaches that are utilized to investigate Epac 1 -containing protein complexes as well as phosphorylation of Epac 1. Besides identifying the known Epac 1 interactor Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP 2), we find that a remarkable amount of cytoskeleton-associated proteins interact with Epac 1. In addition, we identify several phosphorylation sites in Epac 1. We employ a tandem affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> <b>strategy</b> using MCF 7 human breast cancer cells to identify proteins that interact with TSPY-like 5 (TSPYL 5, also known as KIAA 1750) in Chapter 4. We identify ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP 7; also known as herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP)) as a specific TSPYL 5 interactor and demonstrate that this interaction eventually leads to reduced protein levels of the p 53 tumor suppressor, which is the cellular target of USP 7. Finally, Chapter 5 describes that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the transactivation domain of the transcription factor FoxM 1 by CyclinA/cdk complexes, results in relief of inhibition by the N-terminal autorepressor domain during the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. At least one of the responsible sites is identified by a targeted MS-based phosphoproteomics approach using on-line titanium dioxide (TiO 2) phosphopeptide enrichment. In addition, a number of previously unreported phosphorylation sites on FoxM 1 are identified. The work described in this thesis exemplifies that MS-based proteomics can be exploited to examine a wide variety of cellular and biological processes. As this technology is continuously advancing, biologically relevant data can be obtained in an increasingly fast, sensitive and accurate manner. This will significantly contribute to our knowledge of the inner workings of a cell, tissue or an entire organism, which can subsequently be applied in studies on aberrant cellular behavior in the many human diseases, ultimately providing suitable treatments...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria are an {{essential}} part of human life and the environment; well established examples include the human enteric flora and the role of bacteria in the biogeochemical cycling of elements. Nevertheless, we mainly regard them as undesired guests, as e. g. pathogens causing disease, food spoilage and contamination of water supplies. For years, researchers have tried to find ways to control and eradicate bacteria, but despite numerous efforts the mechanisms behind their astounding capacity to survive are still not fully understood. About three decades ago research took an interesting turn, as it was recognized that bacteria are rarely living as free-living, planktonic organisms, but rather are organized, attached to a surface, in complex bacterial communities called ‘biofilms’. Bacteria in these biofilms proved to be even harsher to eradicate. While research has mainly focused on the resistance mechanisms of the majority of a bacterial biofilm population, recently, the existence of a small subpopulation was discovered, one that is not resistant, but rather tolerant {{to a wide variety of}} stresses. These bacteria were called ‘persisters’ and they were proposed to be accountable for the chronic nature of infections and the ineradicable nature of bacteria living in a biofilm. In Part I of this thesis (‘Literature’), a comprehensive background is given that aims to provide insight in the phenomenon of persistence. It gives an introduction about how bacteria adapt to an environment that can be both unpredictable and unfavourable. Further it is discussed what characterizes the persistence state and which genes are possibly involved. Then, the focus is on toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, as they are proposed to play a major role in the formation of persister cells. In particular, attention is given to the hipBA system of E. coli, as it constitutes the first and best characterized ‘persister’ operon. The role of HipBA in persistence in E. coli and the lack of information about the role of HipBA in other organisms prompted further investigation. The aim of this work was to obtain insights into the function of HipBA in another organism, S. oneidensis. This organism is regarded as a model organism, mainly for its properties in processes of dissimilatory metal reduction, redox processes in general, and biogeochemical cycling processes. However, detailed information about the phenomenon of persistence in this organism is lacking. Interestingly, in a screening of a series of transposon mutants for altered biofilm behaviour, carried out in our laboratory (L-ProBE), hipA was identified as a mutant that produced less biofilm. Part II (‘Results’), Chapter 1 reports on the molecular characterization of the HipBA module in S. oneidensis. Here, we describe the HipBAS. O. operon organization, the HipA kinase activity and discuss the physiological implications of loss of the HipBA module. We also report on HipBsS. O. binding to the regulatory region of the hipBA operon and the involvement of cooperativity in this process. In contrast to the E. coli HipBA module, we find no evidence for the role of the ribosomal elongation factor Ef-Tu as HipA target. Hence the functional role of HipA in S. oneidensis remains to be determined. Chapter 2 of this section describes the development of a tandem affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> <b>strategy</b> for the identification of protein interaction partners in S. oneidensis. This method was applied for the elucidation of the functional context of HipAS. O. in order to gain insight in its cellular function. Because the classical TAP tag is a rather large tag and might interfere with proper expression and functioning of the target protein, we developed a new TAP method based on fusion to a new tag, the Strep- 6 His tag. Chapter 3 presents directions for future research unraveling the functional role of HipBA in S. oneidenis. It includes preliminary results on the crystal and solution structural analysis of HipB, and the implications on HipB binding to the hipBA promoter region...|$|R

METHODS: A countrywide survey of oral health performed in 2002 - 03 and comprising 34, 550 children aged 12 years provided information about dental caries levels in 249 Brazilian towns. Socioeconomic indices, the coverage and the fluoride status of the water supply network of participating towns were also appraised. Multivariate regression models fitted the adjustment of dental caries levels and covariates to socioeconomic status and water supply. Inequalities in dental outcomes were compared in towns with and without fluoridated tap water. RESULTS: Better-off towns tended to present a higher coverage by the water supply network, and were more inclined to add fluoride.

The cowpox virus protein CPXV 012 deprives the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of peptides for loading onto newly synthesized MHC class I molecules by inhibiting the transporter associated with Ag processing (<b>TAP).</b> This evasion <b>strategy</b> allows the virus to avoid detection by the immune system. In this article, we show that CPXV 012, a 9 -kDa type II transmembrane protein, prevents peptide transport by inhibiting ATP binding to TAP. We identified a segment within the ER-luminal domain of CPXV 012 that imposes the block in peptide transport by TAP. Biophysical studies show that this domain has a strong affinity for phospholipids that are also abundant in the ER membrane. We discuss these findings in an evolutionary context and show that a frameshift deletion in the CPXV 012 gene in an ancestral cowpox virus created the current form of CPXV 012 {{that is capable of}} inhibiting TAP. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the ER-luminal domain of CPXV 012 inserts into the ER membrane, where it interacts with TAP. CPXV 012 presumably induces a conformational arrest that precludes ATP binding to TAP and, thus, activity of TAP, thereby preventing the presentation of viral peptides to CTLs. © 2014 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies {{of verbal}} reports have always assumed that {{thoughts}} verbalized {{on a given}} occasion {{are not the only}} ones that could have been expressed. This poses a potential problem for a recently developed think-aloud procedure called Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations (ATSS). To address this issue, comparisons were made between the articulated thoughts of subjects over two presentations of a simulated stressful event in the ATSS procedure. Articulated thoughts were analyzed for similarity across presentations both topographically for surface content and inferentially for the amount of irrationality. While the topographic analysis generally sug-gested a lack of stability across presentations, the inferential analysis re-vealed little change. The suggestion is made that incomplete verbal protocols are not problematic for ATSS if the coding <b>strategy</b> <b>taps</b> into the underlying structure presupposed by one's theoretical interest. Interest in understanding the role of cognitive processes in the de-velopment and/or maintenance of maladaptive behavior and emotional disorders has led to the use of assessment approaches that rely pri-Kennon Kashima, M.

40|$|Interferon {{regulatory}} factor (IRF) - 4 is {{a member}} of the IRF transcription factor family, whose expression is primarily restricted to lymphoid and myeloid cells. In T-cells, IRF- 4 expression is induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking or treatment with phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) /Ionomycin, and IRF- 4 is thought to be a critical factor for various functions of T-cells. To elucidate the IRF- 4 functions in human adult T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) -infected T-cells, which constitutively express IRF- 4, we isolated IRF- 4 -binding proteins from T-cells, using a tandem affinity purification (<b>TAP)</b> -mass spectrometry <b>strategy.</b> Fourteen proteins were identified in the IRF- 4 -binding complex, including endogenous IRF- 4 and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) family member, c-Rel. The specific association of IRF- 4 with c-Rel was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments, and IRF- 4 was shown to enhance the c-Rel-dependent binding and activation of the interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) promoter region. We also demonstrated that IL- 2 production was also enhanced by exogenously-expressed IRF- 4 and c-Rel in the presence of P/I, in T-cells, and that the optimal IL- 2 and IL- 4 productions in vivo was IRF- 4 -dependent using IRF- 4 -/- mice. These data provide molecular evidence to support the clinical observation that elevated expression of c-Rel and IRF- 4 is associated with the prognosis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients, and present possible targets for future gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, dynamic {{algorithm}} transformations (DAT's) {{for designing}} low-power reconfigurable signal-processing systems are presented. These transformations minimize energy dissipation {{while maintaining a}} specified level of mean squared error or signal-to-noise ratio. This is achieved by modeling the nonstationarities in the input as temporal/spatial transitions between states in the input state [...] space. The reconfigurable hardware fabric is characterized by its configuration state [...] space. The configurable parameters are taken to be the filter taps, coefficient and data precisions, and supply voltage Vdd. An energy-optimal reconfiguration strategy is derived as a mapping from the input to the configuration state [...] space. In this <b>strategy,</b> <b>taps</b> are powered down starting with the tap with the smallest value of [w 2 k =Em(wk) ] (where wk and Em(wk) are, respectively, the coefficient and energy dissipation of the kth tap). Optimal values for precisions and supply voltage Vdd are subsequently computed from the roundoff error and critical path delay requirements, respectively. The DAT-based adaptive filter is employed as a nearend crosstalk (NEXT) canceller in a 155. 52 -Mb/s asynchronous transfer mode [...] local area network transceiver over category- 3 wiring. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} energy savings range from 02 % to 87 % as the cable length varies from 110 to 40 m, respectively, with an average savings of 69 %.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} report {{long-term}} clinical outcomes in patients treated with the provisional T-stenting and small protrusion (<b>TAP)</b> technique. BackgroundSeveral <b>strategies</b> have been proposed for treating bifurcation lesions, {{each with its own}} merits and technical challenges. The TAP technique is a relatively new strategy that is technically less challenging, ensures complete coverage of the side-branch ostium, and minimizes stent overlap. Although there is reasonable amount of data for other bifurcation strategies, the long-term clinical outcomes for TAP technique are limited. MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent TAP technique with drug-eluting stents between July 2005 and January 2012. The measured endpoints at follow-up were major adverse cardiac events defined as composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. ResultsA total of 95 patients (81. 1 % men) {{with a mean age of}} 64. 8 years underwent TAP stenting. Procedural success was achieved in 100 % of cases. True bifurcation was observed in 75 (78. 9 %) patients. First-generation drug-eluting stents were used in 55. 8 % of patients. The outcome rates at 3 -year follow-up of major adverse cardiac events, cardiac death/follow-up myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and target lesion revascularization were 12. 9 %, 3. 1 %, 9. 7 %, and 5. 1 %, respectively. There were no cases of follow-up myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis (definite and probable). ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that TAP technique is associated with acceptable clinical outcomes with no episodes of definite and probable stent thrombosis. Further studies should compare TAP technique with other 2 -stent strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Globally, {{older people}} are living {{independently}} either alone or with their spouse, population continues to age. In Singapore, some may live with an unrelated older person in a public rental apartment. In Asia, these {{older people are}} associated with increased risks of poor health and social isolation, have poorer social support and a poor quality of life. Few studies have explored why these older people choose such living arrangements, the challenges they encountered and what has helped or may help them overcome these challenges. Aim: To explore older people's experiences of living independently or with an unrelated older person. Methods: This descriptive qualitative study involved face-to-face interviews with 25 informants, 65 years or older in Singapore. Thematic analysis was adopted. Results: Five themes emerged: (1) making own choice - participants decided to live apart from their families, (2) contending with concerns - the availability of external resources for participants was shrinking, (3) coping with the available assistance - depending on available external resources from the community, (4) holding on to their values - participants rely on their internal resources to manage, and (5) preparing for the inevitable - participants were planning for their final years of life and for their death. Conclusion: Older people have such living arrangements for many reasons. They attain well-being {{and quality of life}} by devising <b>strategies,</b> <b>tapping</b> on their limited external resources and relying on their values to manage their diminishing resources and the foreseeable death. Implications for nursing and/or health policy: Understanding older people's experiences may help nurses and health professionals to develop health promotion programmes that support older people's everyday needs and help them to stay healthy. Public health policy must support older people to live in a safe environment near their extended family to reduce their need to relocate...|$|R
40|$|The {{construct}} of coping {{has become a}} central component of empirical research in pediatric psychology. This burgeoning interest in coping reflects {{a shift in the}} field towards assessing adaptive functioning in both chronically ill children and children with acute medical conditions. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about a "gold standard " measure to assess coping in pediatric psychology. The lack of a gold standard is due, at least in part, {{to the fact that there}} are many different definitions of coping and that the emphasis on type of coping varies markedly from study to study. Even in circumstances where two studies examine the same coping strategy or coping style, the items <b>tapping</b> this coping <b>strategy</b> are often quite different. Clinical researchers also are typically interested in examining a number of factors (e. g., the health care delivery system, family factors, and certain individ-ual traits) in addition to adaptive mechanisms, such as coping, when studying adjustment in pediatric patients. Thus, brief measures of coping are often de-sired. The Kidcope (Spirito, Stark, & Williams, 1988) is an example of a screening measure of coping for the clinical researcher. The Kidcope contains 10 common cognitive and behavioral coping strategies designed to cut across situa-tions. At the same time, it was recognized that these coping strategies would not be appropriate for all situations, and that there would be times when additional items would be needed to examine certain questions. The items were not cate-gorized into any higher order structure because the function of a particular coping strategy was believed to vary by situation. Clearly, the brevity of the Kidcope has been its greatest appeal. 'All correspondence should be sent to Anthony Spirito, Child and Family Psychiatry, Rhode Islan...|$|R
40|$|Doctor EducationisThe study aims to {{investigate}} the fundamental validity issues that can affect the DR Congo English state examination, a national exit test administered to high school final year students for certification. The study aspires to generate {{an understanding of the}} potential issues that affect the construct validity of a test within the epistemological stance that supports a strong relationship between test construct and test context. The study draws its theoretical underpinning from three theories: the validity theory that provides a theoretical ground necessary for understanding the quality of tests needed for assessing students’ reading abilities; the construction-integration theory that provides an understanding of how texts used in reading assessments are processed and understood by the examinees; and the strategic competence theory that explains how examinees deploy strategies to complete test tasks, {{and the extent to which}} these <b>strategies</b> <b>tap</b> into the reading construct. Furthermore, the study proposes a reading model that signposts the social context of testing; therefore, conceptualizing reading as both a cognitive and a social process. As research design, the study adopts an exploratory design using both qualitative and quantitative data. Besides, the study uses protocol analysis and content analysis methodologies. While the former provides an understanding of the cognitive processes that mediate the reading construct and test performance so as to explore the different strategies examinees use to answer the English state examination (henceforth termed ESE) test questions, the latter examines the content of the different ESE papers so as to identify the different textual and item features that potentially impact on examinees’ performance on the ESE tasks. As instruments, the study uses a concurrent strategies questionnaire administered to 496 student-participants, a contextual questionnaire administered to 26 student-participants, a contextual questionnaire administered to 27 teacher-participants, and eight tests administered to 496 student-participants. The findings indicate that, the ESE appears to be less appropriate to the ESE context as the majority of ESE test items target careful reading than expeditious reading; on the one hand, and reading at global level than to reading at local level; on the other hand. The findings also indicate that the ESE tasks hardly take account of the text structure and the underlined cognitive demands appropriate to the text types. Besides, the ESE fails to include other critical aspects of the reading construct. Finally, the findings also indicate that the ESE constructors may not be capable to construct an ESE with five functioning distractors as expected. Moreover, the inclusion of the implicit option 6 overlaps with the conceptual meaning of this option. The entire process of the present study has generated some insights that can advance our understanding of the construct validity of reading tests. These insights are: (a) the concept of validity is an evolving and context-dependent concept, (b) reading construct cannot be examined outside the actual context of reading activity, (c) elimination of distractors can sometimes be a construct-relevant strategy, (d) construct underrepresentation is a context-dependent concept, and (e) a reading test cannot be valid in all contexts. The suggested proposal for the improvement of the ESE requires the Congolese government through its Department of Education to (a) always conduct validation studies to justify the use of the ESE, (b) always consider the actual context of reading activity while developing the ESE, (c) revisit the meanings and interpretations of the ESE scores, (d) ensure the appropriateness of tasks to be included in the ESE, (e) ensure the construct representativeness of the ESE tasks, (f) revisit the number of questions to be included in the ESE, (g) avoid bias in the ESE texts in order to ensure fairness, (h) diversify the genres of ESE texts, (i) ensure the coherence of ESE texts through the use of transitions and cohesive devices, (j) ensure that the order of test questions is in alignment with the order of text information, (k) revisit the structure and length of the texts to be included in the ESE, (l) revisit the number of alternatives to be included in the ESE, and (m) reconsider the use of the implicit alternative 6...|$|R
