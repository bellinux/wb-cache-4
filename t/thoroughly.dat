5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed <b>thoroughly</b> in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried <b>thoroughly</b> before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|The patient must be <b>thoroughly</b> {{showered with}} soap and water.|$|E
5|$|According to Ian Kershaw, {{the corpses}} of Braun and Hitler were already <b>thoroughly</b> burned when the Red Army found them, {{and only a}} lower jaw with dental work could be {{identified}} as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|After 1544 {{the estate}} {{began to be}} broken up; first the parks were sold and then the castle itself, bought by Lord Richard Rich from Edward VI for £700 in 1551. Rich {{dismantled}} the castle {{for the value of}} its stone, primarily between 1551 and 1575, and the castle, now <b>thoroughly</b> ruined, passed through Rich's descendants.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was {{recorded}} in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, <b>thoroughly</b> rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva <b>thoroughly.</b> If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E
5|$|Aikido {{techniques}} are usually {{a defense against}} an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks {{to be able to}} practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as <b>thoroughly</b> as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{returned}} to Dealey Plaza {{to photograph the}} assassination site for diagramming purposes, then was sent to Dallas City Hall to retrieve the work of another AP photographer who had pictures of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in custody. This {{was the only time}} he saw the suspect, and Altgens thought Oswald showed signs of having been <b>thoroughly</b> interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the use of}} the {{graduated}} scale and grid reference for maps was not <b>thoroughly</b> described until the published work of Pei Xiu (224–271 AD), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century AD, cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked <b>thoroughly,</b> {{as it can be}} infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
5|$|Before each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events {{as well as}} safety criteria. At least 15 hours before takeoff, the crew would <b>thoroughly</b> pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines.|$|E
5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared <b>thoroughly</b> for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
5|$|Charles was universally beloved, beloved {{not only}} by the crowd of {{individuals}} with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but <b>thoroughly</b> popular with the mass of his subjects and particularly with the poorer populace of London who knew him best.|$|E
5|$|Due to delays with {{delivery}} of jet engines {{and production of}} the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not <b>thoroughly</b> studied. This proved problematic later.|$|E
5|$|Emilia Plater {{was born}} in Vilnius into a noble Polish–Lithuanian Plater family. Her family, of the Plater coat of arms, traced its roots to Westphalia, but was <b>thoroughly</b> Polonized. Much of the family {{relocated}} to Livonia during the 15th century and later to Lithuania, of which Vilnius is the capital. She is described as either Polish, Polish-Lithuanian or Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter <b>thoroughly</b> and soften up the {{defenses}} with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E
5|$|Group 6C-16 is {{an elite}} {{residential}} complex {{that has been}} <b>thoroughly</b> excavated. It lies a few hundred m south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks, ballplayer murals, relief sculptures and buildings with Teotihuacan characteristics.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Friedrichstraße {{station was}} rebuilt; the long-distance {{section of the}} station was {{expanded}} to four tracks and the current station hall was built. Between 1922 and 1932, the Stadtbahn viaduct was <b>thoroughly</b> modernised in order to handle the ever-increasing train weight. Also, the train sheds of Alexanderplatz and Schlesischer Bahnhof were replaced. The suburban line's platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres.|$|E
5|$|In May 1741, Linnaeus was {{appointed}} Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first {{with responsibility for}} medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus {{was responsible for the}} Botanical Garden (which he would <b>thoroughly</b> reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.|$|E
5|$|In October 1994 a {{large-scale}} modernisation programme was {{started on the}} Stadtbahn. The viaducts were checked and strengthened, and the tracks were bedded in concrete to improve durability and comfort. Almost all stations saw large financial investments and were <b>thoroughly</b> modernised. Long-distance traffic between Zoo and Ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during the construction period and the S-Bahn trains temporarily used the long-distance line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, San Francisco spent $1.7million {{each year to}} operate its two fireboats. Maintenance {{problems}} on the historic vessels increased {{to the point that}} Phoenix needed to be lifted into dry dock for extensive repairs to the hull. The fireboat was <b>thoroughly</b> renovated in 2004 at Bayside Boatworks in Sausalito, California.|$|E
5|$|Leo III the Isaurian {{turned back}} the Muslim assault in 718 and {{addressed}} {{himself to the}} task of reorganising and consolidating the themes in Asia Minor. His successor, Constantine V, won noteworthy victories in northern Syria and <b>thoroughly</b> undermined Bulgarian strength.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} large tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus is known from {{relatively}} abundant and well-preserved fossil material. In fact, {{one quarter of}} all fossils collected from the Nemegt Formation belong to Tarbosaurus. Although Tarbosaurus has not been studied as <b>thoroughly</b> as the North American tyrannosaurids, the available material has allowed scientists to draw limited conclusions about its biology.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. Some, such as Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential suburbia, whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and <b>thoroughly</b> industrialised districts. Throughout {{most of its}} recorded history, Oldham was surrounded by large swathes of moorland, which {{is reflected in the}} placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, Marx felt {{he would be able to}} understand more <b>thoroughly</b> what was occurring in the world.|$|E
5|$|Norman's {{mother was}} voiced by Virginia Gregg, Paul Jasmin, and Jeanette Nolan, who also {{provided}} some screams for Lila's {{discovery of the}} mother's corpse. The three voices were <b>thoroughly</b> mixed, except for the last speech, which is all Gregg's.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, rumours emerged of Theodosius's {{survival}} and spread far and wide. It was alleged that his father-in-law Germanus had bribed his executioner, a leading Phocas supporter named Alexander, to spare his life. In this story, Theodosius then fled, eventually reaching Lazica, where he died. Theophylact Simocatta {{reports that he}} <b>thoroughly</b> investigated these rumours and found them false.|$|E
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been <b>thoroughly</b> reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of the workers' village of Deir el-Madinah {{has resulted in}} one of the most <b>thoroughly</b> documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organization, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success, {{securing}} three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had <b>thoroughly</b> enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island {{and in a}} more minor role meant that {{he had time to}} relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Dwight returns to Tallahassee to meet with the president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Meanwhile, in Scranton, Andy fills in for reception and <b>thoroughly</b> enjoys himself.|$|E
5|$|The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} an {{important}} model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, {{and is one of the}} most <b>thoroughly</b> researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first eukaryote whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the filamentous mould Aspergillus has been adopted for genome studies.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's {{leadership}} in Lucca left it {{arguably the most}} <b>thoroughly</b> Protestant city in Italy. The Inquisition led many of these Protestants to flee, creating a significant population of Protestant refugees in Geneva. Several important leaders in the Reformation can also be tied to Vermigli's work in Lucca, including Girolamo Zanchi and Bernardino Ochino.|$|E
5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was <b>thoroughly</b> tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|A {{museum was}} opened inside the {{preserved}} building {{to mark the}} 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was <b>thoroughly</b> renovated before {{the opening of the}} museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now hanging {{on the front of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita {{is typical}} of India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature {{of the past and}} world literature of the future are <b>thoroughly</b> exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
