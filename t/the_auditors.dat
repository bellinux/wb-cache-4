5|$|Following its collapse, {{there was}} some {{speculation}} about whether Great Southern had disclosed to the market issues with the rate of return {{it was going to}} achieve on some of its timber investments.

5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also <b>the</b> <b>auditors</b> for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question <b>the</b> <b>auditors</b> properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

5|$|Profits for the {{undertaking}} showed a steady rise, {{due in part}} to the low maintenance costs of the river. Income from tolls rose from £321 in 1712 to £1,137 by 1802. By this time, traffic consisted of about 11,500tons of coal carried from Bridgwater upstream out of a total tonnage of 14,000tons. Dividends for 1797 were 11.5%, but the capital debt had risen to £85,466 by 1800, when <b>the</b> <b>auditors</b> refused to examine the accounts, because the likelihood of the poor ever benefitting from the navigation was receding. After much negotiation, the capital debt was reduced to £13,000. An act of parliament dated 14 July 1804 enshrined this position, and ensured that interest was limited to six percent, with profits being used to reduce the debt. By 1828, the amount owing had reduced to £4,426.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as <b>the</b> <b>auditors</b> that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
5|$|CT was {{involved}} in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. <b>The</b> <b>auditors</b> released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} {{political}} institutions which held {{the executive and}} legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for <b>the</b> <b>auditors)</b> were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the legislative procedure in use). The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court {{if they fail to}} comply. After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the Commission. The Court was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while <b>the</b> <b>Auditors</b> had no power but to investigate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a firm's owner, an auditor, and outside investors strategically interact. The owner's investment {{in the quality of}} the firm's internal control system and <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> effort jointly affect the informativeness of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report on <b>the</b> firm's financial statements. If <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> legal liability to investors is large, then an efficiency loss arises because the owner underinvests in the internal control system and <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> overinvests effort. On the other hand, if the liability is small, then an efficiency loss arises from the owner's overinvestment and <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> underinvestment, Regulators can improve allocative efficiency by changing <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> legal liability. However, in our model, it is impossible to completely eliminate the efficiency loss by changing <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> liability alone, because no damage award can induce both <b>the</b> owner and <b>auditor</b> to make socially optimal investments in the internal control system and audit effort.

McDonnell hired a consultant at a cost of $75,000 to formulate a new privatization plan prior to the legislative session in January 2011. <b>The</b> <b>auditors</b> found that McDonnell's proposal would have increased the retail price of distilled spirits 11 to 26 percent, which in turn would have led to a drop in liquor sales that could have resulted in a loss of as much as $15.4 million in sales tax revenues.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} auditors {{operated under}} the control of the Audit Commission, which was a body established by (although operationally independent of) central government. Given the highly politicised fight, there was speculation that the Government was encouraging the Commission. Looking back on the history, Martin Loughlin noted that the Government did not appear to be formally directing the Commission, but that there was probably extensive consultation. The Commissioners had on 6 June 1985 directed the extraordinary audits of Lambeth and Liverpool, although by that time the district auditors were already planning to take this course. <b>The</b> <b>auditors</b> calculated the loss to the council as being the amount lost from interest payments on the amount paid by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Treasury Valuer which were unable to be paid until a rate was set; Martin Loughlin notes that this interest had instead accrued to the Government and therefore no money was lost to the public purse.|$|E

25|$|Miami-Dade Transit is {{undergoing}} a federal investigation by the Federal Transit Administration that includes several audits and a criminal investigation of the transit agency due to concerns over money mismanagement within the agency. This caused a freezing of federal funds being granted to the county agency. In late 2010 the county manager claimed that it was 'not fraud' but rather accounting errors, poor management, and erroneous information given to <b>the</b> <b>auditors</b> that triggered the investigation, including a withdrawal of $15 million through the ECHO program that was made by a transit official two hours after a letter arrived in September 2010 from the FTA telling them withdrawals had been restricted.
