5|$|Dorothy and Toto {{discover}} {{that they are in}} Munchkinland, a small town part of the vast Land of Oz. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by Rizzo the Rat and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the Wizard, has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the Good Witch of the North (Miss Piggy), and receives a pair of magic silver slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the yellow brick road to meet <b>the</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Oz, who lives in the Emerald City, the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a Scarecrow (Kermit), a Tin Thing (Gonzo), and a Cowardly Lion (Fozzie). They are also seeking <b>the</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics (Statler and Waldorf) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by Clifford which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the Wicked Witch of the West's magic eye, a tool she uses to see anything she desires in the Land of Oz.|$|E

5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as to call it the greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, <b>The</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E

Musashi is given the blade Fusion, and is charged {{with the task of}} obtaining Brave Fencer Musashi's sword — Lumina, the Sword of Luminescence — before the Thirstquencher Army does. Although Musashi has no {{intention}} of saving the kingdom, he agrees to do so in order to return to his homeland. After Musashi recovers Lumina, he finds {{that most of the people}} from the Allucaneet kingdom, including Fillet, have been kidnapped by the Thirstquencher Empire.

5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes <b>the</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.|$|E
5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in <b>The</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, {{whom he met}} as a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but he enjoyed the script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike <b>The</b> <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> Oz, which he would not bother remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E
