40|$|Munari powder is broadly used in {{physical}} medicine and rehabilitation to decrease pain and help normalize sensory-motor function. It operates as TPRV 1 agonist and “stops” generation of action potentials in pain nerve fibers. This {{is a short}} report of a pilot study on 20 subjects. Every subject underwent four visits to our laboratory, where the Munari applications and related measurements of its effects took place. Each of the healthy adults received the following applications: (1) placebo, i. e. 0 % <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> mixture, consisting only of water and kaolin, (2) weak, i. e. 2. 5 % <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> mixture, (3) medium, i. e. 5. 0 % <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> mixture, and (4) strong, i. e. 10 % <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> mixture. The assessments were carried out before the Munari powder patch application, right after the application, and 15 and 30 min after the termination of the 20 -minute Munari powder patch application. We measured subjective cold/hot feeling on visual analogue scale, blood pressure, body temperature, skin light touch sensations, sense for two-point discrimination, and pain threshold to the mechanical stimulus. Besides these tests, maximal voluntary force during isometric trunk extension and the sitting balance test were performed. The preliminary results indicate that the 5 % concentration of <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> mixture is the best choice because no additional effects were observed with the 10 % concentration and the effects are higher than with 2. 5 % concentration. Whether this will be also thrue for the patients suffering pain ought to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Capsaicin, one of {{the major}} active {{components}} of <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> pills, is an over-the-counter substance with sympathomimetic activity used commonly by young individuals for weight loss. Here we report the case of a previously healthy young male who developed severe chest pain after using <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> pills for slimming and sustained an extensive inferior myocardial infarction. Electrocardiography combined with a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The patient denied using illicit substances, and he had no risk factors for coronary artery disease. His medication history revealed that he had recently started taking <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> pills for slimming. A subsequent coronary angiogram revealed patent coronary arteries, suggesting that the mechanism was vasospasm. We postulate that the patient developed acute coronary vasospasm and a myocardial infarction in the presence of this known sympathomimetic agent. This case highlights the potential danger of capsaicin, even when used by otherwise healthy individuals...|$|R
