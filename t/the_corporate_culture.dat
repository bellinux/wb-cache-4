Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Market Forces is a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years {{to a point where}} corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, {{can be viewed as a}} personification of the story's take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture.</b> Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E
25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture.</b> While ND {{previously}} had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to call back to the office to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E

500|$|The {{review in}} The New York Times {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> and market mechanisms {{that led to}} the Enron scandal with the fictional background of the novel. The same reviewer compared Market Forces to Robert Stone's A Flag for Sunrise which also concerns political and social issues but in a fictional Central American country. The story's use of social commentary is similar to the works of science fiction authors Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth in the 1950s. Book reviewer Nisi Shawl wrote that this story could be part of a subgenre of stories using life-in-a-corporation as a background, along with Eileen Gunn's [...] "Stable Strategies for Middle Management", Kelley Eskridge's [...] "Solitaire", and Charles Stross' Accelerando. Morgan's use of action sequences and car chases led to several comparisons to similar movie sequences, and specifically to Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay movies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> role of <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> in <b>the</b> financial industry.

We take this argument to the empirics and analyze whether banks that {{differ in their}} <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> use different compensation schemes {{in order to attract}} a specific type of workers. In a second step, we combine <b>the</b> role of <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> with <b>the</b> literature on CEO compensation and risk-taking and analyze empirically <b>the</b> impact of <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> on banks' risk-taking as well as on banks' performance. More precisely, we argue that the incentives arising from CEO compensation schemes are diluted once we control for the self-sorting mechanism of CEOs in firms with different <b>corporate</b> <b>cultures.</b> We find that CEOs of banks with a strong competition-oriented <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> have a larger share of variable payments in their total compensation. Moreover, we find that a more competition-oriented <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> is associated with a higher credit risk as well as with a higher buy-and-hold stock market return...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> of New York was a primary {{center for the}} {{construction}} of skyscrapers, and was rivaled only by Chicago on the American continent. There were also residential sections, such as the Bowling Green section between Broadway and the Hudson River, and between Vesey Street and the Battery. The Bowling Green area was described as [...] "Wall Street's back yard" [...] with poor people, high infant mortality rates, and the [...] "worst housing conditions in the city". As a result of the construction, looking at New York City from the east, one can see two distinct clumps of tall buildings—the financial district on the left, and the taller midtown district on the right. The geology of Manhattan is well-suited for tall buildings, with a solid mass of bedrock underneath Manhattan providing a firm foundation for tall buildings. Skyscrapers are expensive to build, but when there is a [...] "short supply of land" [...] in a [...] "desirable location", then building upwards makes sound financial sense. A post office was built at 60 Wall Street in 1905. During the World War I years, occasionally there were fund-raising efforts for projects such as the National Guard.|$|E
2500|$|Disneyland {{originated}} many concepts {{which have}} become part of <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>culture</b> of Disney Parks as a whole, and which in turn spread to its other parks. Most importantly, Disneyland staff use theatrical terminology to emphasize that a visit to the park is intended to be similar to witnessing a performance. Visitors are referred to as [...] "guests" [...] and park employees as [...] "cast members". [...] "On stage" [...] refers to any area of the resort that is open to guests. [...] "Backstage" [...] refers to any area of the resort that is closed to guests. A crowd is referred to as an [...] "audience". [...] "Costume" [...] is the attire that cast members who perform the day-to-day operations of the park must wear. [...] "Show" [...] is the resort's presentation to its guests, such as the color and façades of buildings, placement of rides and attractions, costumes to match the themed lands. When signing credit card receipts, guests are asked for their [...] "autograph". [...] "Stage managers" [...] are responsible for overseeing the operation of the park. Cast members who are in charge of a specific team are called [...] "leads," [...] as in a film or theater [...] "lead role". In earlier years, the offices where administrative work took place were referred to as [...] "production offices". [...] "Production schedulers" [...] build employee work schedules to meet the necessary workload, while [...] "stage schedulers" [...] handle day-to-day changes in that work schedule (such as a change in park hours, necessitating a change in everybody's shifts.) Each cast member's job is called a [...] "role". When working in their roles, cast members must follow a [...] "script", a code of conduct and approved, themed phraseology that cast members may use when at work. [...] "No" [...] and [...] "I don't know" [...] are notably absent from scripts.|$|E
