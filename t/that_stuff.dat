5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is on the album.|$|E
5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

25|$|This should {{insulate}} us {{from that}} industry bullshit, {{people looking for}} the next Nirvana. I don't think anybody is the next Nirvana, certainly not us. People always talk about the next Beatles, the next Elvis. You can't predict <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the right}} {{flank of the}} II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob), the 11th (Northern) Division (Lieutenant-General C. L. Woollcombe) was to capture Hessian Trench {{on top of the}} ridge and Stuff Redoubt; if {{possible}} patrols were to be sent forward to take Stuff Trench. The 34th Brigade (Brigadier-General J. Hill) on the right would have to capture Mouquet Farm, advance up the old German second position trenches to Zollern Redoubt and thence to Stuff Redoubt. Two tanks were attached, to move from positions west of Pozières to arrive at Mouquet Farm at zero hour and then drive north onto the second position. On 28 September the Reserve Army issued instructions <b>that</b> <b>Stuff</b> and Schwaben redoubts were to be captured by 29 September and Stuff Trench on 1 October.|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Durant became {{involved}} with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement. On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, [...] "I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube." [...] As of April 26, 2017, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 100,000 subscribers and one million video views.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> we'd have done enough." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 2, 2015, Workman {{released}} Old Cheetah. According to {{his website}} in a post to the Front page on May 25 by Alex Hudson, [...] "The 12-song effort is theatrical and ambitious. Workman’s signature eclecticism shines brightly on songs like '1000 Miles of Atmosphere,' a nine-and-a-half-minute prog epic <b>that’s</b> <b>stuffed</b> with syncopated rhythms, star-dazzled synth twinkles and unpredictable sonic shifts." ...|$|R
500|$|Jamie Edwards, who {{had helped}} record and tour for Happiness... was heavily {{utilized}} during the recording process and was becoming {{a big part of}} the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> He was very influential. We had him in all our writing sessions. It was a very creative time that was cool because we were all in a room, kind of working together.” ...|$|E
500|$|During the documentary, [...] "What Happens in Vegas...", Beyoncé {{stated that}} when {{the idea of a}} Vegas show was {{presented}} to her, she wanted the show to be a complete 180 from her current tour. Also, she did not want it to be the typical Las Vegas showcase. She wanted to remove the theatrics and [...] "consciously show that I don't need any of <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> Just give me my band, a stage and some cool smoke and lights." [...] Beyoncé and her production quickly organized the show in seven days, based on a script provided by filmmaker Matthew Dickens. She often rehearsed during sound checks of her 2009 tour.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

500|$|Fleury {{remained}} {{embroiled in}} controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours {{that he was}} secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really bothered me through {{this whole thing is}} the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is still going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert soon {{realised}} that {{it would}} be difficult to design the game by himself; he decided to join forces with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, both of whom he hired for Lucasfilm. The game's insult sword fighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring Errol Flynn, which Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman often watched for inspiration. They noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them, which gave the designers the idea to base the game's duels on insults rather than combat. Writer Orson Scott Card helped them write the insults during a visit to Lucasfilm's headquarters at Skywalker Ranch. Many of Gilbert's original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process, although he stated that [...] "most of <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was left out for a reason".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics are}} more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any {{intention}} of presenting an allegorical message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but [...] "we just {{wanted them to be}} representative of the Axis world powers at the time. It just seemed kind of amusing. It's a tease. All <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> with Charlie– [...] the [...] "Heil Hitler!" [...] business– [...] sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." [...] In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: [...] "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we may have encouraged it– [...] like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing".|$|E
