40|$|It {{is known}} that plasma cells occur {{normally}} in the connective tissues of warm blooded animals {{and that they are}} increased in numbers around various pathological lesions. In a study of the cellular reactions to the different chemical fractions of the tubercle bacillus, Sabin, Doan, and Forkner (1) reported the presence of these cells in rather large numbers in the omenta of rabbits after intraperitoneal injections of <b>tuberculo-protein.</b> The present work was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of the <b>tuberculo-protein</b> as a stimulant for plasma cells; and to use the resulting proliferations of plasma cells for a study of their histogenesis. If the plasma cell is accepted as a definite cellular entity, it must have a maturation cycle, as have the myeloid elements and the lymphocyte (2).

40|$|Prior {{observations}} on the cellular reactions to tuberculo-phosphatide are confirmed and compared with reactions induced by this material in tuberculous animals. In the latter the response is accelerated and augmented and simulates the Koch phenomenon. <b>Tuberculo-protein</b> produces no macroscopic reaction in normal animals. The microscopic reaction of neutrophiles and monocytes regresses {{in less than a}} week. The same material in tuberculous animals causes a response characterized by more or less hemorrhage and necrosis, tissue degeneration, and infiltration of neutrophiles and monocytes. Late in the reaction there may be a few epithelioid cells and foreign body giant cells. Preparations of tuberculo-phosphatide which contain no tubercle bacilli, or only a few, induce the typical cellular response but do not induce hypersensitiveness to tuberculin. Repeated intradermal skin-test injections of <b>tuberculo-protein</b> MA- 100 in normal guinea pigs may be followed by a mild hypersensitiveness to subsequent injections...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} {{reaction in}} tuberculous and normal guinea pigs and rabbits is elicited by the <b>tuberculo-protein</b> and probably {{not at all}} by the polysaccharides.

40|$|As {{result of}} finding {{numerous}} plasma {{cells in the}} omenta of rabbits injected with <b>tuberculo-protein,</b> a method to induce the production {{of large numbers of}} these cells has been discovered. The tissues in which they were pronouncedly increased were the subserosal connective tissues of the omentum, body wall, and intestinal wall. The precursor of the plasma cells is a primitive connective tissue cell. As this cell develops into the typical Marshalk√≥ plasma cell there is a progressive increase in the basophilia of the cytoplasm, the nucleus becomes eccentric, a condensation of the chromatin occurs near the nuclear membrane, and there is a loss of the nucleoli. At the time when the nucleus assumes the eccentric position, the clear area appears {{in the center of the}} cytoplasm. The early cells are capable of reproducing themselves by mitosis, while the typical mature cells divide by amitosis. The mature plasma cells often have muddy, spongy cytoplasm which contains acidophilic or hyaline granules as the cells grow old or begin to degenerate. The cells with granules or hyaline bodies usually have pycnotic or fragmented nuclei. These cells are the final stage reached by some plasma cells. Others, when degenerating, show vacuoles and signs of senility. Those with the granules and hyaline bodies are the so called Russell body cells. Plasma cells developed in greatest numbers after our largest injections of <b>tuberculo-protein.</b> The differentiation into young, mature, and senile forms was most clearly recognizable when some days had been allowed to elapse after the last large injection of the stimulating agent. A description of the plasma cell as viewed supravitally has been given. The cells are met in the blood stream as well as in the tissues. They are characterized by their deep yellowish gray cytoplasm, indistinct eccentrically placed nuclei, and large numbers of mitochondria. The plasma cells differ from lymphocytes, in that they did not develop in large numbers after direct stimulation of the lymph nodes with <b>tuberculo-protein.</b> The young plasma cells also differ in morphology from the young lymphocytes. When plasma cells were found in the lymph nodes they were in the connective tissue cords. The plasma cell is a definite entity, having a maturation cycle. It is stimulated to great proliferation by certain toxic irritants...|$|E
40|$|For {{a period}} of years we have been {{studying}} the effects of materials from tubercle bacilli on the tissues of normal and tuberculous rabbits and guinea pigs. The present study {{is the beginning of the}} project to use some of the fractions together to see if the presence of two substances in the tissues modifies the effect of either given alone. In the experiments described here it has been found that the addition of tuberculo-phosphatide to <b>tuberculo-protein</b> enhances the sensitization to the protein to a marked extent, producing, after three or four injections of relatively small amounts of protein, a degree of sensitization like that of the disease. The subject of sensitization in connection with tuberculosis has a long and complex history. In 1910 and 1911 Baldwin (1) published important studies on the nature of tuberculin sensitivity in which he concluded that the presence of tubercles was necessary in order that <b>tuberculo-protein</b> should elicit skin reactions like those of the disease. He found that after repeated intmperitoneal injections of tuberculoprotein (filtered water-extract) into both rabbits and guinea pigs they exhibited a form of anaphylactic response, that is, they would die if the same extract were injected intravenously or intracerebrally but they did not react locally to intradermal injections. He used accessory materials to induce the skin-sensitizing * The work forms a part of the plan of the Research Committee of the National Tuberculosis Association, of which Dr. William Charles White is Chairman.

40|$|We {{have been}} {{studying}} the cellular reactions to different preparations of <b>tuberculo-protein.</b> In accordance with the plans of the Research Committee of the National Tuberculosis Association, of which Dr. William Charles White is Chairman, all of the tubercle bacilli {{used for this study}} were grown on a liquid synthetic medium entirely free from protein. In this way none of the preparations was contaminated with traces of any other protein. Since the work of Goldmann (1, 2), it has been known that materials injected into the tissues as particulate matter are engulfed by the phagocytic mononuclear cells. The tuberculo-proteins offer material with which to compare the effect of two substances which are certainly nearly the same except that one can be introduced in solution and the other in suspension. The preparations of the proteins obtained from the media were given to us by Dr. Florence B. Seibert, of The Henry Phipps Institute for the Study of Tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the various}} {{synthetic}} media proposed for growing Mycobac-terium tuberculosis for tuberculin production, the emphasis {{has been on}} finding one which "would yield {{the greatest amount of}} growth per unit volume of culture medium in the shortest possible time " (Henley, 1929), on the tacit assumption that the amount of tuberculin produced parallels more or less directly such growth. Thus, Henley and LeDuc (1930), using the weight of organisms produced as a basis of comparison, stated that their ammonium malate medium was somewhat inferior to Henley's asparagine medium. Recently the Committee on Medical Research of the National Tuberculosis Association (White, 1934) adopted a synthetic medium with a high asparagine content for the manu-facture of the Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) because it gave "a greater yield in bacilli and production of the desired protein molecule. " Substitutes for glycerol in media for tuberculin production have been discarded as unsatisfactory because they yielded fewer organisms. When we reported a synthetic me-dium from this laboratory (Wong and Weinzirl, 1936) as having the virtue of being inexpensive, we used the weight of organisms produced as the standard of comparison with other media. Recently, however, because of the increased use of <b>tuberculo-protein</b> antigens in immunizing and desensitizing experiments in the Alice McDermott Foundation, we have been led to raise these questions: What is the relation between the weight o...|$|E
40|$|It was {{reported}} by White in 1928 (1) and confirmed by Sabin, Doan, and Forkner (2, 3) that a polysaccharide isolated from the tubercle bacillus by Anderson (4) was toxic for tuberculous guinea pigs. With doses of 10 mg. the guinea pig either'died within a few hours, in which case there was a precipitous fall in temperature; or it survived and showed only a temporary fall in temperature with subsequent rise above the normal level. There was also {{a change in the}} blood cells characterized by a rise in the neutrophilic leucocytes and a fall in lymphocytes. Similar phenomena follow the administration of <b>tuberculo-protein.</b> Since the polysaccharide, as prepared, has a certain nitrogen content, and since all the protein preparations contain carbohydrate, one must resort to a biological titration in order to determine responsibility for the intoxication. By giving the polysaccharide and the protein to tuberculous animals, in decreasing doses, we have ascertained that the temperature reaction is due to the protein, since amounts of polysaccharide which do not contain as much nitrogen as is present in a temperature-alterlng dose of the protein fail to elicit the change. In the course of our testing of fractions from tubercle bacilli, it has become clear that we must consider not only fractions from different types of bacilli, according to the plan of the Research Committee of the National Tuberculosis Association (5), but also the varying manifestations of the disease in different species of animals. To show the relations of these different factors we have drawn up an outline (Table I). The attempt at any quantitative comparative estimation of the factors of the disease must be considered as only an approximation, subject to marked variations in individual animals. For the...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} report (1) {{it was shown}} that the intracutaneous injection of tuberculo-phosphatide into tuberculous animals produced a local reaction without macroscopic necrosis which persisted for some time. The reaction more closely resembled the Koch phenomenon (altered and accelerated reaction of a tuberculous animal to reinoculation) than a tuberculin reaction. Therefore {{it was decided to}} study the cytology of this reaction and compare it with the reaction of tuberculous animals to <b>tuberculo-protein</b> (water-soluble MA- 100, Mulford). Many of the lipid components of tubercle bacilli have been studied by Sabin and her associates (1 - 10) with reference to the cellular responses of animals to injections of them. The waxes (10) and the acetone-soluble fat (9) are remarkable cell stimulants and each plays a part in producing the cellular picture of tuberculosis. But the reactions to the phosphatide {{have been the subject of}} more extensive research because: (a) the phospholipid forms a fine suspension in water whereas the other lipids must be suspended in other media; (b) it induces the formation of tubercular tissue, particularly of epithelioid cells, as shown by Sabin and Doan (2 - 4) and Sabin, Doan, and Forkner (5 - 7); and (c) because of the specificity of the reaction induced by it. That is, following the initial reaction of granulocytes, the only cells remarkably affected are monocytes, and the latter are so altered as to become typical epithelioid cells (7, 1). In all of the studies mentioned above the materials employed have been isolated from tubercle bacilli by Dr. R. J. Anderson t whose studies were summarized in 1932 (11). The first specimens of tuberculo-phosphatide prepared by Dr. Anderson contained acid-fast debris and a few tubercle bacilli, to which some of the reaction might have been attributed. More recently he has filtered his phos...|$|E
