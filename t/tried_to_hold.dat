5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million. While they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on to the opening {{as long as they}} could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their ground {{against the new}} German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it would quickly be surrounded if it <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> its position.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} days of July, the 24th Infantry {{generally}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> positions during the day, and then withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; during the first few North Korean attacks, most units held positions until they ran out of ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Eugene and Jonathan Coachman. The match started with Eugene hitting an arm drag on Coachman and hitting {{numerous}} headbutts. An unknown {{woman in a}} bikini {{came out to the}} ringside area with some cookies, Coachman offered cookies to Eugene. The woman lured Eugene out of the ring and Eugene went over and grabbed some cookies. As Eugene went to grab more cookies, Coachman slammed Eugene's head into the cookie tray. A spot in the match saw Garrison Cade come out to ringside with a stuffed animal, which prompted Cade to tear up said toy animal. Cade <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> Eugene so Coachman could get the advantage, however, Eugene was able dodge the attack, as Coachman ended up hitting Cade instead. Eugene Rock bottomed Coachman and pinned him for the win.|$|E

5|$|The next attack {{took place}} on 20 July as part of Operation Atlantic. It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment, with {{supporting}} units from the Cameron Highlanders. In {{the early hours of}} 20 July, the Highlanders secured a position in St André-sur-Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks. At the same time, the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge, supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft. The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain, which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud. Counterattacks by two Panzer divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion—the Essex Scottish—came under attack. The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> back the advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division, while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in the Operation Goodwood, the largest armoured battle of the campaign. By the end of the day, the South Saskatchewans had taken 282 casualties and the ridge was still in enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 athletes on the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players on the DL up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low throw from Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed on the DL. Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Before the North Vietnamese {{finalised}} {{their plan}} to capture Da Nang, the 2nd Army Corps {{had already begun}} making preparations for the final attack on the city. On March 24, the VPA 325th Division fought with the ARVN 258th Marines Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion at North Hai Van, and overran Phuoc Tuong, Nuoc Ngot, Tho Son and Thua Luu. Consequently, North Vietnamese forces captured enemy artillery positions in Phuoc Tuong, and made good use of it during the following weeks. On March 27, with air-support from A-37 attack aircraft from Da Nang, the 258th Marines Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off North Vietnamese forces at Phu Gia and Hai Van, but they were pushed back and sustained heavy casualties in the process. The VPA 325th Division then continued their advance through So Hai, Loan Ly, An Bao and Lang Co. Soon afterwards, more than 30 artillery pieces belonging to the VPA 84th and 164th Artillery Regiments were placed at various high points in Son Thach, Son Khanh and Mui Trau; beginning at 5:30am on March 28, North Vietnamese artillery units bombarded South Vietnamese positions around Da Nang. Meanwhile, the ARVN 369th Marines Brigade quickly abandoned their position at Son Ga, after they had detected elements of the VPA 304th Division conducting reconnaissance missions on the battlefield. On March 28, the VPA 66th Regiment (304th Division) attacked and captured the administrative area of Ai Nghia and Nuoc Man airfield, while the VPA 24th Regiment attacked Hoa Cam and Toa in the outskirts of Da Nang.|$|E

5|$|By 13:20, the battlecruisers {{had caught}} up with Spee, who {{realized}} his armored cruisers could not escape the much faster battlecruisers. He ordered the three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off the British squadron with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Sturdee instead ordered his cruisers to chase down the fleeing German light cruisers while Invincible and Inflexible dealt with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Spee deftly maneuvered his ships, taking the leeward position; the wind kept his ships swept of smoke, which improved visibility for his gunners. This forced Sturdee into the windward position and its corresponding worse visibility. Scharnhorst straddled Invincible with her third salvo and quickly scored two hits on the British battlecruiser. The German flagship was herself not hit during {{this phase of the}} battle. Sturdee attempted to widen the distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to within the range of his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time.|$|E
5|$|Moreau had an {{opportunity}} to smash one of the enemy forces, but he moved slowly. Saint-Cyr started from Oberkirch on 2 July. The next day his wing moved in an easterly direction, seizing enemy positions at Oppenau, on the Kniebis Mountain and at Freudenstadt. This deep thrust completely separated Fröhlich {{from the rest of the}} Army of the Upper Rhine. Latour and Sztáray <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a position behind the Murg River but Desaix attacked them in the Battle of Rastatt on 5 July. To assist in this operation, Moreau directed Saint-Cyr to move down the Murg valley. On the same day as Rastatt, Taponier's division captured Gernsbach. At Rastatt, the French employed 19,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to spar with 6,000 Austrians led by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann Mészáros von Szoboszló. The French turned both Austrian flanks, forcing their enemies to pull back east toward Ettlingen. Casualties on both sides were light. The Austrians lost 200 men and three guns captured. At Ettlingen Latour found the archduke's leading elements, with the main body still a few days distant. The Austrians were in a vulnerable situation but Moreau delayed for three days at Rastatt, allowing Charles to bring up 25 battalions and 39 squadrons.|$|E

Faced with an overwhelming force, Thado Minsaw issued a challenge of single combat on war elephants to his nephew, who accepted. The nephew prevailed after a long drawn out battle, driving off his uncle off the field. Thado Minsaw with 2000 of his men fled to northern hills but died en route.|$|E
25|$|Still, the {{recalcitrant}} Burmese king <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on {{to all his}} gains. To {{reinforce the}} Chinese front, he recalled from Siam {{a major portion of}} the army, which arrived back to Ava with the Siamese captives in July 1767. As it turned out, the remaining Burmese forces in Siam, which {{could not have been more}} than 10,000 at most, were too scattered among many garrisons, and too small to hold the conquered kingdom together. Indeed, the Burmese had little control outside their garrisons, and no control over the Siamese countryside where gangs of bandits roamed.|$|E
25|$|Although the Shakespeare papers had {{prominent}} believers (including James Boswell), sceptics had questioned their authenticity {{from the}} beginning, {{and as the}} premiere of Vortigern approached, the press was filled with arguments over whether the papers were genuine or forgeries. On 31 March 1796, Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone published his own exhaustive study, An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments, about the supposed papers. His attack on the papers, stretching to more than 400 densely printed pages, showed convincingly that the papers could be nothing other than modern forgeries. Although believers <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their ground, scholars were convinced by Malone's arguments.|$|E

Skleros, who had returned from his Arab exile and had been captured by Bardas Phokas, tried to assume the leadership of the revolt, allying himself with Bardas's sons Leo and Nikephoros, but soon submitted to the emperor.

25|$|On 5 July, Junot sent Margaron with 3,000 {{troops on}} an {{expedition}} to Tomar and Leiria where he successfully stamped out the revolt. On 25 July, Junot ordered Louis Henri Loison to lead an expedition east toward Elvas. On 29 July, Loison's 8,800 soldiers and eight field guns encountered 2,900 Spanish and Portuguese regulars in the Battle of Évora. Margaron personally led the 86th Line Infantry Regiment in smashing through the Allied center and capturing three cannons. The defeated Allied infantry retreated to Évora which they and some poorly-armed townspeople <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold,</b> but the French broke into the town and massacred 2,000 defenders. French casualties were 90 killed and 200 wounded, which they revenged by brutally sacking the town. Three days later, Loison received orders to return to Lisbon to repel a British invasion.|$|E
