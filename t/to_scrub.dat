5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E
5|$|It {{seems that}} most of the Romano-British sites were {{abandoned}} by the 5th century and the arable land reverted <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> and woodland. Arriving in the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons began to clear the land again. Bletchley ("Blaeca's clearing") and Shenley ("Bright clearing") date from this period. Large settlements have been excavated at Pennyland and near Milton Keynes Village. Their cemeteries have been found at Newport Pagnell, Shenley and Tattenhoe.|$|E

5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They {{are known to}} both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia is used <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> SO2 {{from the}} burning of fossil fuels, and the {{resulting}} product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR (selective catalytic reduction), relies on a vanadia-based catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Banks always provide stamp pads or ink paste, in {{addition}} to dry cleansing tissues. The banks also provide small plastic scrubbing surfaces similar to small patches of red artificial grass. These are attached to counters and used <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> the accumulated ink paste from the working surface of customers' seals.|$|E
25|$|Finally the Swiss-based Climeworks is {{currently}} building the first industrial scale direct air capturing plant in Hinwil, Switzerland.

The CO2 should be sold to a local vegetable growing company.|$|E
5000|$|Using counter {{rotating}} tube style brushes that rotates {{perpendicular to}} the floor, cylindrical floor scrubbers clean rough or uneven surfaces. Cylindrical brushes usually have a collection tray behind the brushes that can pick up larger debris such as rocks, screws and small bolts. This reduces the need to sweep or dust mop prior <b>to</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> although {{it is still a}} good idea if possible.|$|R

25|$|Some old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and {{lighthouse}} {{service with}} heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope.

25|$|The lowland heath habitat (heathland below 300metres elevation) of Bickerton Hill is {{considered}} particularly valuable. Lowland heath is an internationally scarce habitat that is rare within Cheshire; a survey in 1995 found only 60Ha in the administrative county. Bickerton Hill {{is the largest}} of the four lowland heath SSSIs in the county. A semi-natural habitat, heathland requires active management, such as grazing, to avoid succession <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> and woodland.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{approaches}} can {{be taken}} with respect <b>to</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> from simply reprogramming the FPGA to partial reconfiguration. The simplest method of <b>scrubbing</b> is <b>to</b> completely reprogram the FPGA at some periodic rate (typically 1/10 the calculated upset rate). However, the FPGA is not operational during that reprogram time, {{on the order of}} micro to milliseconds. For situations that cannot tolerate that type of interruption, partial reconfiguration is available. This technique allows the FPGA to be reprogrammed while still operational.|$|R

25|$|The {{condenser}} {{tubes are}} made of brass or stainless steel to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce thermodynamic efficiency. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> them clean without {{the need to take}} the system off-line.|$|E
25|$|Debating {{over the}} choice <b>to</b> <b>scrub</b> {{the mission and}} extract the troops, and the {{possibility}} of capturing the LTTE high command, and in particular, hunt down Prabhakaran, the decision was taken by Harikat Singh to instruct the Para Commandos to stick to the operational plans already set. The Para Commandos would leave the landing ground and hunt for the place where the LTTE leaders were supposed to be hiding, while the Sikh LI troops would be left behind to hold the landing ground.|$|E
