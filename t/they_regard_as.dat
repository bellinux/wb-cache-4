5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

25|$|Their {{customary}} {{method of}} trading was by bartering {{one thing for}} another, such as food, cloth, cattle, fowls, lands, houses, fields, slaves, fishing-grounds, and palm-trees (both nipa and wild). Sometimes a price intervened, which was paid in gold, as agreed upon, or in metal bells brought from China. These bells <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> precious jewels; they resemble large pans and are very sonorous. They play upon these at their feasts, and carry them {{to the war in}} their boats instead of drums and other instruments.|$|E
25|$|Popular Resistance Committees is a {{coalition}} {{of a number of}} armed Palestinian groups opposed to what <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> the conciliatory approach of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah towards Israel. The PRC is especially active in the Gaza Strip, through its military wing, the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades.

25|$|The nonexistence of {{adolescence}} in the Middle Ages {{served as a}} model for Daenerys's sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. Many high-born women were married at or below that age because the onset of sexual maturity supposedly turned children into adults. With the Targaryens, the novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep its bloodlines pure; but Martin also portrayed a sociopathic element in the incestuous relationship of the twins Cersei and Jaime Lannister, whose strong bonding inhibits their pairing with others whom <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> inferior.|$|E
25|$|The main {{arguments}} from the mythicists are {{the lack of}} biographical information on Jesus from early Christian and other sources, the so called argument from silence, {{as well as the}} mythical and allegorical nature of the Christ of Paul and the Jesus of the Gospels. Most Christ mythicists agree that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus Christ is weak at best, pointing at a series of perceived peculiarities in the sources which <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> untrustworthy for a historical account and noting the reliance on Jewish writings and the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with the mystery religions of the Greco-Roman world.|$|E
25|$|The Indus civilisation's economy {{appears to}} have {{depended}} significantly on trade, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. The IVC {{may have been the}} first civilisation to use wheeled transport. These advances may have included bullock carts that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and what <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> a docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal in western India (Gujarat state). An extensive canal network, used for irrigation, has however also been discovered by H.-P. Francfort.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} few days the representatives of the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been engaged in conversations, the primary purpose of which has been to prepare the way for the holding of a general conference {{on the subject of the}} {{limitation}} of naval armaments. I have now much pleasure in notifying your Excellency of the formal acceptance by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the proposal of the German Government discussed at those conversations that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be in the proportion of 35:100. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E

500|$|The Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd {{visited the}} {{federation}} in January 1957, while Welensky prepared to outline the difficulties regarding African advancement. Seeking to bring Africans into the established political processes, and hoping they would shun the recently formed African National Congress (ANC) parties, Welensky hit out {{at what he}} saw as the poor Colonial Office practice of making the situation [...] " [...] of two opposed policies, black rule and white rule.

500|$|An {{analogous}} {{case is that}} of the screwball comedy, {{widely accepted}} by film historians as constituting a [...] "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a [...] "style". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a [...] "cycle" [...] and a [...] "phenomenon", even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Other critics treat film noir as a [...] "mood", characterize it as a [...] "series", or simply address a chosen set of films <b>they</b> <b>regard</b> <b>as</b> belonging to the noir [...] "canon". There is no consensus on the matter.|$|E
