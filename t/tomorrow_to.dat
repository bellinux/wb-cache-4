25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
500|$|Liman {{said that}} the film's {{repeated}} scenes intentionally paralleled the respawning feature in video games, where players have to start over on a level if their character dies. [...] In the afterword of All You Need Is Kill, author Hiroshi Sakurazaka notes his experience playing video games {{as a source of}} inspiration while writing the novel. Salons Ryan Leas said analyses of the film noted that it [...] "steals from the video game genre". Leas called Edge of Tomorrows looped action [...] "a meta-commentary on the blockbuster genre", saying: [...] "It's a blockbuster interested in the question of how mind-numbing its genre has become to its viewers." [...] Comparing Edge of <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> film adaptations of video games, [...] Angela Watercutter said Liman's film was more successful for [...] basing itself around the medium's narrative structure, and for its [...] "ability to continue after 'Game Over' and discover something new".|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 season, Thome hit [...]269 with 37 {{home runs}} and 106 RBIs. On June 21, he hit his 20th home run of the year against the Chicago White Sox, marking the seventh {{consecutive}} season in which he hit 20 or more home runs. On September 29, while {{in the midst of}} a tight race for the AL Wild Card spot, Thome led the Indians to an 8–4 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays by hitting a two-run home run. After the game, Thome was quoted as saying, [...] "This team has battled all year, so this was nothing new. Here we are, and we're here <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> play another day." [...] Despite finishing with a record of 90–72, the Indians missed the playoffs. For the 2001 Indians' season, he finished second in the AL with 49 home runs. In addition, Thome had 124 RBIs and 111 walks. However, he led the league with 185 strikeouts. He and Juan González, who totaled 140 RBIs, powered the Indians to another division title. Despite these numbers, the Indians could once again only reach the AL Division Series, where they lost in five games to the Seattle Mariners.|$|E

500|$|Northumberland {{was tried}} on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall. The panels {{of the jury}} and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues. Dudley hinted that he had acted on the {{authority}} of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked [...] "whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges". After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen's mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to [...] "confess to a learned divine" [...] and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward's reign in the Tower and was now Mary's Lord Chancellor. The Duke's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that [...] "the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us now {{is that we have}} erred from the faith these sixteen years." [...] A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley's words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt [...] "that I must prepare myself against <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> receive my deadly stroke", as he wrote in a desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: [...] "O my good lord remember how sweet life is, and how bitter ye contrary." [...] On the scaffold, before 10,000 people, Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained: ...|$|E
500|$|The two visit Loretta in her {{own room}} and find out that she feels guilty for {{cheating}} on him with Quagmire, and believes she can {{never go back to}} Cleveland. Later, Cleveland visits Brian to clear any negative feeling he has against him and Carolyn, as they are at [...] "a point of great soreness", but then Cleveland announces to Brian plans to elope with Carolyn in Hawaii, which makes their friendship tense. Just as Cleveland leaves, Loretta appears out of nowhere. Loretta apologizes to Cleveland for her affair with Quagmire, she then announces that she wants to get their family back together and promises she'll never betray him again. Cleveland goes to Peter and Lois for advice on what should be done. Peter and Lois think Cleveland shouldn't go back to Loretta, but Brian (seeing this as his only chance at getting back with Carolyn) says Cleveland should [...] "forgive and forget", and points out Loretta's good qualities (which he's obviously lying, as his nose starts to grow). Cleveland decides to talk to Loretta <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> see how he feels about getting back together with her. Thinking Loretta hasn't changed, Peter recruits Quagmire to have sex with Loretta again so Cleveland can see she hasn't changed. Quagmire meets her at the hotel she's staying in, but this time, Loretta resists his advances and tells him to beat it after smashing him in the face with an iron. When Cleveland shows up to her hotel room, Cleveland forgives her, but insists that {{it is time for the}} both of them to move on while Loretta lives her life as amazing and wonderful as she can. Cleveland finally leaves as Loretta tearfully watches on. When Cleveland visits Carolyn, he finds her and Quagmire having sex, apparently the same way it happened to Brian. Since both Brian and Cleveland have been cheated on by the same woman, Cleveland apologizes to him for stealing Carolyn and they make amends, with the former revealing himself to have received a genital wart.|$|E

2500|$|In Napoleon's Last Campaign, Petre {{posits that}} the Emperor Napoleon {{abandoned}} the guiding principles {{of his previous}} success, which lay in his relentless pursuit of his opponent's main army. In the Saxon Campaign, Napoleon lost sight of his primary objectives, becoming mired in secondary achievements. Petre noted also the vast increase in sheer numbers, {{on both sides of}} the contest, and predicted that in terms of numbers, [...] "we must wait for the wars of <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> see those numbers exceeded." [...] World War I interrupted his work as a military historian; he was recalled from retirement to work in the Finance office of the Munitions Ministry. On 26 March 1920, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|CBS {{considered}} expanding As the World Turns and Search for <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> 45 minutes (eliminating the timeslot {{during which}} stations broadcast local newscasts), but eventually decided to expand As the World Turns, its front-runner {{in the ratings}} battle, to a full-hour length. [...] CBS set a target of September 1975 to complete the expansion and needed to free up 30 minutes' worth of space on its schedule to do so. Game show The Price Is Right was relocated to 10:30 am and aired a week's worth of 60-minute shows in September as a test for a potential permanent expansion. While The Price is Right's expansion was intended as temporary to start, the expansion of As the World Turns was to be permanent. As such, the network was required to cancel {{one of the other}} programs on its schedule.|$|E

2500|$|When Napoleon {{heard that}} Saint-Priest {{captured}} Reims {{he realized that}} he might score a cheap victory over the Allies. A success at Reims would cut the link between the army Blücher to the north and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Allied army to the south. The war was going badly for Napoleon. Marshal Jacques MacDonald was falling back before Schwarzenberg, Eugène de Beauharnais was in a tight spot in Italy, Marshal Pierre Augereau was losing territory in the south. The political situation also appeared dire. The Allies were negotiating the Treaty of Chaumont in order to more closely bind their alliance against the French emperor and the French people were tired of the war. Napoleon needed a quick victory to restore his reputation. The emperor wrote, [...] "My intention being to attack Saint-Priest near Reims <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>to</b> defeat him and reoccupy the town".|$|E
2500|$|All but Rocco leave. A {{march is}} played as Pizarro enters with his guards. Rocco warns Pizarro that the {{minister}} plans a surprise visit <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> investigate accusations of Pizarro's cruelty. Pizarro exclaims that he cannot let the minister discover the imprisoned Florestan, {{who has been}} thought dead. Instead, Pizarro will have Florestan murdered (Ha, welch ein Augenblick—"Hah! What a moment!"). As a signal, Pizarro orders that a trumpet be sounded at the minister's arrival. He offers Rocco money to kill Florestan, but Rocco refuses (Jetzt, Alter, jetzt hat es Eile!—"Now, old man, we must hurry!"). Pizarro says he will kill Florestan himself instead, with Rocco forced to dig the grave in a ruined well in the dungeons. Once the grave is ready, Rocco is to sound the alarm, upon which Pizarro will come into the dungeon and kill Florestan. Fidelio, hearing Pizarro's plot, is agitated, but is soothed by thoughts of Florestan (Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin? and Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern—"Scum! Where are you off to so fast?" [...] and [...] "Come, hope, let the last star").|$|E
2500|$|The series {{opens with}} the Freemans {{settling}} into the fictional, peaceful, and mostly white suburb of Woodcrest. Evidence for the real-world {{location of the}} fictional Woodcrest is mixed. Proponents of the Chicago's South Side theory cite the real-life suburb of Crestwood, Illinois and the similarity of the two names. The first season features several Chicago Landmarks: a skyline shot showing the Willis Tower, Grant Park, buildings of the Michigan Avenue Historic District, and Lake Michigan; as well as elevated rapid transit endemic to the city, resembling the Chicago [...] "L". More conclusive evidence is presented in [...] "The Trial of Robert Kelly", in which Riley asks Grandad, [...] "Can you take us into the City <b>tomorrow</b> <b>to</b> watch the R. Kelly Trial?". Grandad denies his request and tells him to walk, and Riley replies [...] "But it's 40 miles!" [...] In reality, R. Kelly is from Chicago, and this trial was in fact held in there, giving more evidence that The Boondocks is in fact set in Illinois. Another conclusive reference to Chicago is Martin Luther King Drive, a major street running through South Chicago, being referenced for its violent activity in the 9th episode of season 1, [...] "Return of the King". Additionally, in [...] "Let's Nab Oprah", Ed Wuncler III, Gin Rummy and Riley go to Oprah Winfrey's television studio {{in an attempt to}} kidnap her. Oprah's television show was recorded at Harpo Studios in Near West Side Chicago.|$|E
