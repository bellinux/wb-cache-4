5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
5|$|CASS4 {{has been}} {{reported}} to play a modifying role in cystic fibrosis severity, progression and comorbid conditions. The CAS family member NEDD9 has also been shown <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> directly with AURKA (encoding Aurora-A kinase) to regulate cell cycle and ciliary resorption; it is possible that CASS4 may similarly interact with aurora-A kinase.|$|E

5|$|The {{final step}} in the {{formation}} of Egyptian religion was the unification of Egypt, in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country. These sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with the gods, and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion.|$|E

5|$|Tião was a {{well-known}} solitary female Bottlenose Dolphin that was first spotted {{in the town}} of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with her. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned her the nickname killer dolphin.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with warfarin. Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with warfarin (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began <b>to</b> <b>interact,</b> notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|BabyFirst {{was founded}} in 2004 by Guy Oranim and Sharon Rechter. Its first {{broadcast}} was through DirecTV in 2006. It was founded by Regency Enterprises, Kardan, and Bellco Capital. Distribution expanded through agreements with the Echostar Dish Network, Comcast, AT U-verse and others. It also developed a premium BabyFirst YouTube channel, and mobile apps.

5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} {{californium}} isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with other particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> {{with the main}} characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean {{reported}} that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E

50|$|Traditional media {{speaks to}} a target {{audience}} in a one-way fashion. This allows the brand to build awareness and convey its messaging to help shape and define its image. However, the advent of social media has provided brands with the ability <b>to</b> massively <b>interact</b> with their target audience and create a fan base of customers willing to champion the brand. The brand moves beyond shouting at the audience <b>to</b> <b>interacting</b> with them in a more casual and trusted manner.|$|R

5|$|Entry to {{the cell}} begins through {{interaction}} of the trimeric envelope complex (gp160 spike) and both CD4 and a chemokine receptor (generally either CCR5 or CXCR4, but others are known <b>to</b> <b>interact)</b> on the cell surface. gp120 binds to integrin α4β7 activating LFA-1 the central integrin involved {{in the establishment of}} virological synapses, which facilitate efficient cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1. The gp160 spike contains binding domains for both CD4 and chemokine receptors.|$|E
5|$|From 1943-47, Durante and Moore had a joint show, with Moore as the {{straight}} man. Impressed with his ability <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> with audiences, CBS offered him his own show.

5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
50|$|This {{leads to}} many {{interesting}} results. For instance, if n {{is close to}} zero, then it represents a small connection between the current loops; the larger it is, the more of a connection there is. This allows a smooth transition from non-interaction <b>to</b> <b>interacting.</b>|$|R
