5|$|The ships had {{extensive}} electrical generator systems. Leipzig had three power plants that {{each had a}} 180kilowatt <b>turbo-generator</b> and a 180kW diesel generator; this gave the ship a combined output of 1,080kW at 220volts. Nürnberg had four generators which comprised two 300kW turbo-generators and two 350kW diesel generators, for a total output of 1,300kW, also at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single rudder. Admiral Hipper and Blücher were equipped with three electricity plants with four diesel generators and six turbo-generators each; the diesel generators supplied 150kW apiece, {{four of the six}} turbo-generators provided 460kW, and the final pair provided 230kW. Total electrical output was 2900kW. Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow were equipped with three 150kW diesel generators, four 460kW turbo-generators, one 230kW <b>turbo-generator,</b> and one 150kW AC generator, for a total of 2870kW. All five ships' electrical plants operated at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck then shifted fire to Prince of Wales. The British {{battleship}} {{scored a}} hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on Prince of Wales, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon Prince of Wales, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a <b>turbo-generator</b> room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed {{through one of the}} boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five electricity plants. Each plant consisted of four diesel generators and eight <b>turbo-generators.</b> The four diesel generators {{were divided into}} pairs: two provided 150kilowatts each and two supplied 300kW each. The eight <b>turbo-generators</b> were also of mixed capacity; six ran supplied 460kW each and the remaining two provided 230kW each. Total power output was 4,120kW at 220volts.|$|R

25|$|Closed-cycle systems use fluid {{with a low}} boiling point, such as ammonia (having {{a boiling}} point around -33°C at {{atmospheric}} pressure), to power a turbine to generate electricity. Warm surface seawater is pumped through a heat exchanger to vaporize the fluid. The expanding vapor turns the <b>turbo-generator.</b> Cold water, pumped through a second heat exchanger, condenses the vapor into a liquid, which is then recycled through the system.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company <b>turbo-generator.</b> The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free-running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the AGR was such that the final steam {{conditions}} at the boiler stop valve were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of <b>turbo-generator</b> plant could be used. The mean temperature of the hot coolant leaving the reactor core {{was designed to be}} 648°C. In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite oxidises readily in CO2 at high temperature) a re-entrant flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278°C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary too much from those seen in a Magnox station. The superheater outlet temperature and pressure were designed to be 2,485psi (170 bar) and 543°C.|$|E

50|$|California was a steamship, with oil-fired {{furnaces}} heating her boilers {{to power}} two steam turbo generators that ran {{at a constant}} 2,800 RPM. These supplied current to her 18 ft-high electric propulsion motors, which had a combined rating of 2,833 NHP or 17,000 shp. The <b>turbo-generators</b> and propulsion motors were built by General Electric, which was the world pioneer of turbo-electric propulsion, having supplied the <b>turbo-generators</b> and electric motors for , the World's first turbo-electric ship, a decade earlier.|$|R

25|$|The PRR had {{a design}} style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a PRR {{trademark}} that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the U. S. PRR also used track pans extensively to retrieve {{water for the}} locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the PRR had a clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive. Smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive. Otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp {{at the top and}} a steam-driven <b>turbo-generator</b> behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Swordfish {{departed}} the scene, Bismarck and Prince of Wales {{engaged in a}} brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit. Bismarcks damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 <b>turbo-generator</b> feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to [...] to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.|$|E
500|$|At 06:13, Leach {{gave the}} order to retreat; only five of his ship's ten [...] guns were still firing and his ship had {{sustained}} significant damage. Prince of Wales made a 160° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing Prince of Wales and destroying her, Lütjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy, firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered Bismarck and Prinz Eugen {{to head for the}} North Atlantic. In the engagement, Bismarck had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return. The forecastle hit allowed [...] of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. Lütjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship. The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the <b>turbo-generator</b> room, but this was not serious, as Bismarck had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree list to port and a 3-degree [...] by the bow.|$|E
