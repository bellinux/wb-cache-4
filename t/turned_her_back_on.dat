5|$|Hollis is {{very much}} aware of Black's {{reputation}} and eager to prove her worth as an investigator. Intrigued by Frank's abilities as an investigator, she strives to learn as much from him as she can, while Frank also learns to recognize her strengths as an FBI agent. The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him {{she has not}} <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him, but {{plans to}} seek a new path to him. While on a walk around town passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core {{concepts}} of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of {{the virtues of the}} faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having marital problems when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder than he would like to admit. Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

25|$|The Progressives {{were founded}} {{during the late}} 1870s {{by a group of}} yangban who fully {{supported}} Westernization of Joseon. However, they wanted immediate Westernization, including a complete cut-off of ties with Qing China. Unaware of their anti-Chinese sentiments, the Queen Consort granted frequent audiences and meetings with them to discuss progressivism and nationalism. They advocated for educational and social reforms, including the equality of the sexes by granting women full rights, issues that were not even acknowledged in their already Westernized neighbor of Japan. The Queen Consort was completely enamored by the Progressives in the beginning, but when she learned that they were deeply anti-Chinese, she quickly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> them. Cutting ties with China immediately was not in her gradual plan of Westernization. She saw the consequences Joseon would have to face if she did not play China and Japan off by the West gradually, especially since she was a strong advocate of the Sadae faction who were pro-China and pro-gradual Westernization.|$|E

500|$|Woodall and Constantine have {{appeared}} on Parkinson three times together. Their first appearance in 2003 coincided with the host's now infamous interview with Meg Ryan. Parkinson said that he felt Ryan's behaviour towards his fellow guests, Woodall and Constantine – whom Ryan <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> – was [...] "unforgivable". Woodall has made appearances on numerous other chat shows and on Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car, a recurring segment on the BBC Two motoring programme Top Gear.|$|E

500|$|Left Hand {{has been}} a focus of {{literary}} critique of Le Guin's work, along with her Earthsea fiction and utopian fiction. The novel {{was at the center}} of a feminist debate when it was published in 1969. Alexei Panshin objected to the use of masculine [...] "he/him/his" [...] gender pronouns to describe its androgynous characters, and called the novel a [...] "flat failure". Other feminists maintained that the novel did not go far enough in its exploration of gender. Criticism was also directed at the portrayal of androgynous characters in the [...] "masculine" [...] roles of politicians and statesmen but not in family roles. Sarah LeFanu, for example, wrote that Le Guin <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> an opportunity for experimentation. She stated that [...] "these male heroes with their crises of identity, caught in the stranglehold of liberal individualism, act as a dead weight at the center of the novel". Le Guin, who identifies as a feminist, responded to these criticisms in her essay [...] "Is Gender Necessary?" [...] as well as by switching masculine pronouns for feminine ones in a later reprinting of [...] "Winter's King", an unconnected short story set on Gethen. In her responses, Le Guin admitted to failing to depict androgynes in stereotypically feminine roles, but said that she considered and decided against inventing gender-neutral pronouns, because they would mangle the language of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson {{asked her what she}} would do if she were in his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1898 publication, Topsy Tinkle recounted a {{story that}} the Indians told about a natural spring located {{on the site of}} the Old Mill. The story told of a 16-year-old Indian named Catalina with [...] "thick, jet-black hair" [...] and [...] "big, melting black eyes." [...] Catalina lived in the time of the San Gabriel Mission and gave roses to the Virgin Mary in hopes that she could win the heart of the {{handsome}} Jose, even hoping that [...] "something dreadful" [...] would happen to another girl of whom Jose was fond. When Jose left for two years serving on a ship, Catalina <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Virgin, and Catalina began praying to the old [...] "Mexican god", described as a [...] "hideous clay image". Catalina died of sorrow when Jose did not return, and her body was buried on the spot where the mill was later built, a spot from which a natural flow of spring water [...] "slowly oozes". According to the legend, oozing spring water is [...] "only the tears from a loving woman's broken heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The poem betrays a {{particular}} animus for Mary Wollstonecraft and, by extension, others Polwhele {{considered to be}} of her radical, pro-French camp: writers Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Mary Robinson, Charlotte Turner Smith, Helen Maria Williams, Ann Yearsley, Mary Hays and Ann Jebb, and artists Angelica Kauffman and Emma Crewe. Strangely, perhaps, only Hays, Jebb and Smith shared political sympathies with Wollstonecraft, and Smith, by 1798, had <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her previous ideas. The others, though, in different ways, all fell afoul of restrictive ideas of female (and class) decorum. Yearsley, for example, a labouring-class poet who had a dispute with her patron, Hannah More, is accused of longing [...] "to rustle, like her sex, in silk" [...] (l.102). According to one editor, [...] "one can only conclude that Polwhele attacks these women not {{for what they are}}, but for what they are not: they are unsexed, unfeminine, either because they are immodest, or unsentimental, or insubordinate. Women must do more than simply avoid setting a bad example: they must provide a positive model of chaste, sentimental, subordinate femininity." [...] Of this transgressive group, Polwhele invites the reader: ...|$|E
