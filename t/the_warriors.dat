5|$|As the {{two worlds}} begin to merge, Dusk and Alba reveal their {{plans to go to}} the ancient {{floating}} city known as Mysidia. Once <b>the</b> <b>Warriors</b> of Light arrive and meet the Elder of Mysidia, Sophia, the Avalon Empire attempt to strike Mysidia with their airship superweapon Heliogabalus. <b>The</b> <b>warriors</b> destroy the ship with the aid of Dr. Lugae, the living doll Argy, and Barbara and her dragons. Sophia then helps <b>the</b> <b>warriors</b> gain the last remaining crystal in the World of Light within the caves of Mysidia. After gaining the crystal's ability, Mysidia falls to the ground while simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>Warriors</b> of Darkness are aided by a mysterious man known as The Mask in gaining the last crystal fragment remaining in the World of Darkness. They succeed in gaining the fragment, however The Mask dies. Before his death, he reveals himself to be Elgo's other half that formed when the world split in two and asks <b>the</b> <b>Warriors</b> of Darkness {{to take care of his}} other Half as he dies. After both parties gain the fragments, the split world merges and both parties are reunited, however most of the people in the world have disappeared. Attempting to make a frontal attack to the Avalon Empire, <b>the</b> <b>warriors</b> discover a barrier protecting Avalon and eight gates across the world, linking to a realm called the Rift. Upon entering one of the gates, <b>the</b> <b>warriors</b> encounter a dark sphere in which Sophia explains it is a substance found only in the Rift known as Dark Matter, and that Avalon's goal is to harvest it for their evil purposes. Vata explains the Avalon Empire is guarding the dark matter across the world with their generals, who have been revived in undead forms. After collecting all eight pieces of the dark matter and defeating the undead generals, the dark matter fuses together, creating a new crystal and revealing that the crystal split the world to protect itself from the Empire's plans. The crystal then breaks the barrier that was protecting Avalon, allowing <b>the</b> <b>warriors</b> to enter.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> obtained <b>the</b> venomous blood of a cerberus.

The Giver, who followed the two, reminded <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. <b>The</b> <b>warrior</b> declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at <b>the</b> <b>warrior's</b> vengeful act and retreated. Because <b>the</b> <b>warrior</b> killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken.

Elgo then utilized the power of Nil to move between the worlds and ensured that <b>the</b> <b>Warriors</b> collect the crystals in effort to restore the world so that he could achieve his goals. <b>The</b> <b>Warriors</b> and Elgo battle, with Elgo using the power of Nil against them. When he is defeated, Elgo loses control of Nil and it mutates him into a dark monster. <b>The</b> <b>Warriors,</b> seeing that Nil will ravage their world unchecked, fight the transformed Elgo and win.

This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. <b>The</b> <b>Warriors</b> managed to defy conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. <b>The</b> <b>Warriors</b> won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process.
