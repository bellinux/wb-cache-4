40|$|The jig {{grips the}} {{container}} screw <b>thread</b> <b>hole</b> (3) {{of the container}} (2), e. g. a barrel, by a sensing grip (15) on a robot assembly to align it with the axis of the hole. A robot support arm (5) with vertical and horizontal servo drives moves the screw closure (6) or cap into the fitting position to enable a servo drive on the robot assembly to secure the closure. The whole system self-aligns with the hole axis using the sensor grip position. Displacement sensors, on the robot assembly, monitor {{the position of the}} closure and the hole and ensure an accurate and rapid fitting of the closure.

50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a threaded bushing, is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole.</b> They may be used to repair a stripped <b>threaded</b> <b>hole,</b> provide a durable <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a plain hole on the fatigue {{properties}} of a body undergoing uniaxial loading is a well-studied area. However, for the case of <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> that are not being used together with a bolt, little {{can be found in}} the literature. In this project, stress concentration factors, Ktn, for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> following the ISO metric standard, have been calculated using finite element models in ANSYS. Based on theser esults, estimations of the fatigue notch factor, Ktf, for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> were derived. The magnitude of Ktf depends on how the notch sensitivity index, q, is being determined. In this project, both Neuber’s and Peterson’s formulas were used as estimates of q and a comparison between the two methods was made. The stress concentration factors for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> were significantly higher than the corresponding stress concentration factors for plain holes. As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, Ktn decreased. In the fatigue analysis, Peterson’s formula predicted higher values of the fatigue notch factor compared to Neuber’s and could therefore be useful in design purposes. Furthermore, the reduction in fatigue strength for the <b>threaded</b> <b>holes,</b> compared to the plain holes, was calculated. These results showed that the percentage decrease in fatigue strength for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> was approximately the same, regardless if Neuber’s or Peterson’s estimation of q was used. The reduction in fatigue strength for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> with a coarse pitch, compared to plain holes, varied from about 16 % for the smallest diameter tested(M 6) to about 10 % for the biggest (M 68). The corresponding reduction for <b>threaded</b> <b>holes</b> with a fine pitch varied from about 14 % for the smallest diameter (M 6) to about 9 % for the biggest (M 64). As the size of the hole and the surrounding body was increased, the threads’ effect on the fatigue strength decreased...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{pre-tension}} {{force in}} an insert screw connection are examined {{in order to}} establish a greater understanding of the system and to facilitate the process of making new metal cutting tools.

50|$|A {{blind hole}} {{refers to a}} hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece.

In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind hole, conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R

50|$|Around this time, Europe was {{beginning}} to enter an era of industrial revolution, and new technological breakthroughs helped provide timpanists with possible ways to alter the pitch {{on one of their}} drums. The first major advancement {{is believed to have been}} made by Gerhard Cramer in 1812. The new orchestral works required faster tuning of the timpani. He worked with a court locksmith and the royal armorer to make his first set of drums. Although no diagrams or drawings of what the drums actually looked like exist, there are several rough descriptions of how the drums worked. The kettle of the drum was attached to a wooden base. Rods curved down along the kettle and connected the counter hoop to a <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> at the bottom of the bowl. There was a bolt inside of the <b>threaded</b> <b>hole</b> that allowed for the entire mechanism to be raised and lowered. In order for the bolt to be turned and the drum to move, there were several levers that led to a larger vertical lever that came out of the wooden base and when moved would either raise or lower the bowl, thus changing the pitch.|$|R
