25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money.

He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss.

The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends {{it back to the}} Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E

25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going.

25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to {{pay a visit to}} one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to go to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E
25|$|In 1690, during William's absence in Ireland, Carmarthen was {{appointed}} Mary's chief advisor. In 1691, attempting to compromise Halifax, he discredited himself by the patronage of an informer named Fuller, soon proved an impostor. He was absent in 1692 when the Place Bill was thrown out. In 1693, Carmarthen presided in great state as Lord High Steward {{at the trial}} of Lord Mohun; and on 4 May 1694 he was created Duke of Leeds. The same year he supported the Triennial Bill, but opposed the new treason bill as weakening {{the hands of the}} executive. Meanwhile, fresh attacks were made upon him. He was accused unjustly of Jacobitism. In April 1695, he was impeached once more by the Commons on suspicion of having received a bribe of 5000 guineas to procure a new charter for the East India Company. Although he had not actually accepted the gold, he had allowed it to remain in his house for over a year, only returning it when the inquiry began. In his defense, while denying that he had intended to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> ("it had been left with him only to be counted by his secretary") and appealing to his past services, Leeds did not attempt to conceal the fact that according to his experience bribery was an acknowledged and universal custom in public business, and that he himself had been instrumental in obtaining money for others. Meanwhile, his servant, who was said to have been the intermediary between the Duke and the Company, fled the country; and with no evidence to convict, the proceedings fell apart.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the transmission of}} Quatermass II {{in the autumn of}} 1955, Hammer Film Productions released The Quatermass Xperiment, their film adaptation of the first serial. Kneale was not pleased with the film, and particularly disliked the casting of Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. [...] " [...] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." ...|$|E
500|$|Annie Hall was {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim upon its release. Tim Radford of The Guardian called the film [...] "Allen's most closely focused and daring film to date". The New York Times Vincent Canby preferred Annie Hall to Allen's second directorial effort, <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> and Run, since the former is more [...] "humane" [...] while the latter is more a [...] "cartoon". Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage (1973), including Joseph McBride in Variety, who found it Allen's [...] "most three-dimensional film to date" [...] with an ambition equal to Bergman's best even as the co-stars become the [...] "contemporary equivalent of... Tracy-Hepburn." ...|$|E

After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. [...] This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.|$|E

500|$|Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first {{assembly}} of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. [...] "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," [...] Brickman recalled. [...] "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled." [...] Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as [...] "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life {{and in the process}} satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> and Run". Brickman found it [...] "nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise." [...] He suggested a more linear narrative.|$|E
500|$|Declared [...] "eyesore of the year" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994, the burned, empty {{tower was}} {{an embarrassment to}} the city {{according}} to an editorial in The Inquirer. The editorial said the feeling only became worse after One Meridian Plaza {{could be seen in}} the background in the film Philadelphia. The fire left the area a commercial void. Nearly every major store in the area closed and property values fell. Neighboring property owners, such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza, were waiting for a decision {{on the future of the}} building before going through with their own development plans. In 1996 the city of Philadelphia sued E/R Partners saying One Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired. The city and Mayor Ed Rendell were afraid that when E/R Partners settled with Aetna they would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and leave the building unfixed.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of The Quatermass Experiment gained {{the attention of}} the film industry, and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy, supported by the English actor Jack Warner, with Val Guest directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass. He stated in an interview, [...] " [...] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." [...] The film was titled The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X-certificate status. In America the film was renamed The Creeping Unknown after the title Shock! was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|The College of Arms {{produced}} two colours for the RLI, with Queen Elizabeth II giving final approval to a Queen's colour and a regimental colour on 15 July 1963. The {{first of these}} was a standard Union Flag design; the unit's name was marked on a circle, which was placed centrally and surmounted by a crown. The second {{was based on a}} dark green background and featured the regimental badge in its centre, surrounded by a wreath of flame lilies, Rhodesia's national flower, and topped, as with the Queen's colour, with the royal crown. The Battalion took part in Operation Zephyr {{during the second half of}} 1963, a counter-intimidation action against political agitators from the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). As with the previous posting to Kariba, little to no action was necessary; it was enough of a deterrent that troops were present. When the Federation broke up on the last day of 1963, members of the Federal Army could transfer to the Southern Rhodesian Army, request a posting to Northern Rhodesia, or leave the military altogether, receiving a monetary [...] "golden handshake" [...] if they chose the last option. So many servicemen chose to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and leave that [...] "only a handful", according to paymaster Lieutenant Paddy Leen, remained in the mess on 31 December 1963. Leen had paid off over 200 RLI men since the start of work on 30 December.|$|E
500|$|Bart names his new {{elephant}} Stampy {{and ties}} {{him to a}} post in the backyard. Lisa begins complaining that keeping an elephant as a pet is cruel, while Homer is concerned that Stampy will eat him out of house and home. In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to {{make enough money to}} cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the children the elephant must go. The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. Blackheart reach a deal, [...] Stampy and Bart run off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield, and are soon nowhere to be found. The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits.
