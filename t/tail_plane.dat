5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E
25|$|Stahlschmidt {{was awarded}} the German Cross in Gold on 9 April 1942. Stahlschmidt crash-landed and being shot down by ground-fire on 7 May in Werknummer 8480. The rocky terrain tore off the <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> of the Bf 109.|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Short Brothers and Harland Ltd of Belfast on 2 August 1950. The machine was designed to allow three different wing sweep angles (50°, 60° and 69°). The sweep adjustment of the wings was made when the aircraft was on the ground. Two different <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> positions (a) low on the rear fuselage and (b) {{on top of the}} fin, were also tested. This requirement was met by the construction of two entirely different rear fuselages and tail units.|$|E
5000|$|Investigations in 1936 {{following}} {{a series of}} fatal crashes resulted in late production aircraft being built with additional fin area {{in the shape of}} vertical [...] "Zulu Shield" [...] extensions to the <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> to improve lateral stability - these aircraft were designated D.H.86B.|$|R
50|$|Manufacture {{throughout}} the war years included wings for De Havilland Tiger Moth and Airspeed Oxford trainers, wing flaps for Fairey Barracuda torpedo-bombers and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers, fuselages for Shorts Stirling heavy bombers and Airspeed Horsa gliders, and <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> for Bristol Beaufighter heavy fighter.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War {{the works}} was kept busy {{repairing}} bomb damaged carriages and wagons and in converting carriages to mobile hospitals {{to support the}} army during the D-Day invasion. The works were also involved in constructing Bailey bridges and the <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> for Airspeed Horsa gliders for the invasion.|$|R
25|$|Japanese patrols were {{infrequent}} and Carey scrambled {{only three}} time in June 1942. In July the squadron received the Hurricane IICs armed with Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannons. On 3 August he damaged the <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> of a Hurricane {{when he hit}} a tree during a mock-ground attack flight. On 11 September 1942 Carey was flying a high altitude patrol at 25,000 feet when his engine failed and force landed back at the airfield. Three days later he chased a Japanese aircraft out over the sea without success. On 12 October 1942 Carey was promoted to officer commanding 165 Wing RAF at Dum Dum airfield.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{constructed of}} wood with fabric covering. The wings reduced outwards in both thickness and chord, with dihedral outboard of the centre section. They were constructed according to Basil Henderson's patent, and folded rearwards {{at the rear}} spar for storage. There were split flaps inboard. The fin and rudder were initially {{very similar to those}} of the Hendy 302, with a horn balance and a notable nick on the leading edge where that balance met the fin, but this was soon replaced by the final symmetric, elliptical and unbalanced arrangement. The horizontal surfaces were also rounded, and <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> incidence was adjustable in flight for trim; the elevators were mounted on a common shaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{adopted an}} atypical tail-first configuration; this approach {{had the effect}} of greatly reducing trim-drag while also generating increased lift at slower speeds. Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary flight control surfaces were actutated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul. Fly-by-wire electrical controls and automatic control systems were also to be employed on the type. The undercarriage, designed by Dowty Group, used an arrangement of a single centre-fuselage main unit complete with four wheels, a nose unit with two wheels, and a pair of outriggers located on the engine nacelles.|$|E
50|$|Fifteen C-135As, {{powered by}} Pratt & Whitney J57 turbojets, were built. In later years, almost all were {{upgraded}} with Pratt & Whitney TF33 turbofan engines and wide-span <b>tail</b> <b>planes,</b> and were re-designated C-135E. Most {{were converted to}} various special roles, including airborne command posts, missile-tracking platforms, and VIP transports, and were withdrawn throughout the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Thirty C-135Bs {{were built}} with the TF33 turbofans and wide-span <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> from the start, {{and a small}} number remain in service in their {{original}} form. Ten were modified for a weather reconnaissance (flying through radioactive clouds from nuclear tests or other agents) role and designated WC-135B Stratolifter (Constant Phoenix in later versions). Additional airframes were converted to RC-135s from the 1970s to 2006, and remain in service with further equipment upgrades installed.|$|R
25|$|MQ-1B Block 10 / 15: Current {{production}} aircraft include updated avionics, datalinks, and countermeasures, modified v-tail planes {{to avoid damage}} from ordnance deployment, upgraded AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting System, wing deicing equipment, secondary daylight and infrared cameras in the nose for pilot visual in case of main sensor malfunction, and a 3ft (0.91m) wing extension from each wingtip. Some older MQ-1A aircraft have been partially retrofitted with some Block 10 / 15 features, primarily avionics and the modified <b>tail</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Weeks later, on 30 May, Marseille {{performed}} another mercy mission after witnessing his 65th victory—Pilot Officer [...] of No. 250 Squadron RAF—strike the <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> of his {{fighter and}} fall {{to his death}} when the parachute did not open. After landing he drove out to the crash site. The P-40 had landed over Allied lines but they found the dead pilot within German territory. Marseille marked his grave, collected his papers and verified his identity, then flew to Buckland's airfield to deliver a letter of regret. Buckland died two days before his 21st birthday.|$|E
500|$|The A330 and A340 {{fuselage}} {{is based}} on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: [...] and [...] Typical seating arrangements are 2–2–2 six-abreast in business class and 2–4–2 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> are used as fuel tank, flaps, ailerons and spoilers are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight When necessary, the A330 uses the Honeywell 331–350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power.|$|E
500|$|Eaton {{was awarded}} the Air Force Cross on 10March 1931 [...] "in {{recognition}} of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators". The media called him the [...] "'Knight Errant' of the desert skies". Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the Kookaburra, Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the Wackett WarrigalI with Sergeant Eric Douglas. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls {{when he tried to}} recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the <b>tail</b> <b>plane.</b> Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience. In December 1931, he was posted to No.1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work. Promoted squadron leader in 1936, he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the Dutch East Indies, primarily Timor and Ambon. Wearing civilian clothes, he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in Koepang, Dutch Timor. Eaton was appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.21 Squadron in May 1937, one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in Central Australia, this time for prospector Sir Herbert Gepp, who was subsequently discovered alive and well. Later that year, Eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a Hawker Demon biplane in Victoria, recommending a gallantry award for Aircraftman William McAloney, who had leapt into the Demon's burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot; McAloney subsequently received the Albert Medal for his heroism.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} research program Wirbelschleppen I. A generic model DLR-F 13 with adjustable horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> was employed to generate 4 -vortex wake systems. Measurements were {{carried out in the}} water towing tanks WSG at DLR, and in a larger water towing tank in Hamburg (HSVA) for validation. Results of PIV measurement and flow visualisation revealed that, for several HTP settings, the established 4 -vortex wake systems exhibited the potential of a relatively fast decay in the far-field...|$|R
50|$|The Moscow Aviation Institute Sh-Tandem (Ш-Тандем, other designations include Sh-MAI and MAI-Tandem) was a Soviet {{experimental}} {{ground attack}} aircraft of the 1930s. Designed by Peter Grushin at the Moscow Aviation Institute (hence the MAI designation), the aeroplane featured an unusual tandem wing, with the <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> {{as large as}} 45% of the wing area. Elevators served as ailerons at the same time. While similar in layout to contemporary Soviet fighters (notably the Polikarpov I-16), the design also included a rear gunner's turret in the tail.|$|R
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the <b>tail</b> <b>planes,</b> and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|R
2500|$|Though it was {{intended}} as a floatplane powered by a 100hp (75kW) 12-cylinder Renault engine, it initially flew as a landplane with the smaller 70hp Renault air-cooled upright V-6 as used in the R.E.1. [...] In this configuration the rudder was mounted above and clear of the <b>tail</b> <b>plane,</b> leaving room for the one piece elevators and having the same shape, roughly a flattened oval with its long axis parallel with the fuselage, as that of the B.E.3. [...] The landplane version was {{often referred to as the}} R.E.2.|$|E
2500|$|The inquest resumed on 13 August {{and heard}} more reports from {{witnesses}} and technical {{evidence from the}} investigation. The head of the Air Ministry investigation said the removal of parts of the wreckage for souvenirs had not helped his work. The investigation had shown no evidence of faulty material or bad workmanship {{but it was clear}} that the port wing had folded or collapsed upwards where it joined the fuselage. The engine and <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> had broken away and the passengers were thrown out of the aircraft. The coroner directed that as a government inquiry would be held then some of the technical details of the accident need not be heard. The coroner could see no reason to further delay the verdict until after the inquiry by the Aeronautical Research Committee. The jury returned a verdict [...] "that the victims met their death falling from an aeroplane, the cause of the accident being unknown".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1944 Hawker refined the {{proposed}} design substantially. The jet exhaust was moved {{from beneath the}} tail and re-designed as two short split-lateral [...] exhausts (which gained the name [...] "trouser legs"), embedded in {{the trailing edge of}} the wing root, which needed a corresponding thickening of the wing root; the air intakes were moved to the wing root leading edge, similar to the contemporary de Havilland Vampire. The shorter unusual bifurcated jet pipe reduced pressure losses in the jet pipe and had the additional advantage of freeing up space in the rear fuselage for fuel tanks, which gave the aircraft [...] a longer range than many other early jets. The absence of fuel tanks also meant a thinner wing could be adopted without the penalty of reduced range; to ease manufacture, the elliptical wingform of the Fury was discarded in favour of a straight tapered wing design. The fuselage fuel tanks, being fore and aft of the engine, also provided for a stable centre of gravity during flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> was raised in order to clear the jet exhausts. The Sea Hawk also featured a nosewheel undercarriage arrangement, the first for a Hawker-built aircraft. The aircraft was built to accommodate four 20mm Hispano-Suiza Mk. V cannons.|$|E

40|$|The wake shape under {{symmetrical}} {{flight conditions}} {{and its effects}} on aerodynamic characteristics are examined. In addition, the effect of wake shape in sideslip and discrete vortices such as strake or forebody vortex on lateral characteristics is presented. The present numerical method for airplane configurations, which is based on discretization of the vortex sheet into vortex segments, verified the symmetrical and asymmetrical roll-up process of the trailing vortices. Also, the effect of wing wake on <b>tail</b> <b>planes</b> is calculated. It is concluded that at high lift the assumption of flat wake for longitudinal and lateral-directional characteristics should be reexamined...|$|R

2500|$|This small, {{sesquiplane}} outclassed the Fokker Eindecker {{in every}} respect, including speed, climb rate and maneuverability. It featured ailerons for lateral control {{rather than the}} Fokker's wing warping, giving lighter, quicker roll response, and its elevator was attached to a conventional <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> which provided better pitch control {{as opposed to the}} all-moving, balanced [...] "Morane type" [...] elevators of the Fokker. The Fokker's success was solely due to its synchronized machine gun which fired forward through the arc of its propeller. At the time, the Allies lacked a similar system, and the Nieuport 11's Lewis machine gun was mounted to fire over the propeller, allowing uninterrupted forward fire. The Lewis was not synchronizable, due to its open bolt firing cycle design which resulted in an unpredictable rate of fire. Clearing gun jams and replacing ammunition drums in flight were challenging though, and the drums limited ammunition supply. This was eventually resolved in French service by the application of the Alkan synchronization gear with a Vickers machine gun to Nieuport fighters starting with some later examples of the Nieuport 16. The British, in the absence of their own satisfactory synchronizer, continued with the overwing Lewis but employed a new [...] "double" [...] Lewis drum with a capacity of 98 rounds.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for very}} light aircraft, trim {{tabs on the}} {{elevators}} are unable to provide the force and range of motion desired. To provide the appropriate trim force the entire horizontal <b>tail</b> <b>plane</b> is made adjustable in pitch.
