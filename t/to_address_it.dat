He surrendered on August 15, 2007, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy. He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players' physical condition and player/referee relations, and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies. Donaghy also {{admitted that he had}} a severe gambling addiction, and was on medication <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it.</b> He was released on a $250,000 bond.|$|E

However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E

25|$|A {{government}} may subsidize {{production of a}} public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result {{in some form of}} a competitive market. The potential for cronyism (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, principal–agent problems can arise between the citizens and the government or {{between the government and the}} subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it</b> can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{are also}} {{especially}} sensitive {{to feelings of}} rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure. Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely. This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people {{to the presence of}} a problematic situation and move them <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it</b> which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress. People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.|$|E

500|$|The 2007–2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged macroeconomic theory. [...] Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, {{there was great}} disagreement on how <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it.</b> The new synthesis consensus broke down as economists debated policy responses {{to deal with the}} deep recession. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an economic bubble, but neither of the major macroeconomic schools had paid much attention to finance or a theory of asset bubbles: how they form, how they can be recognized, and how they can be prevented. The failures of current economic theory to deal with the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment.|$|E
500|$|Unemployment bred labour militancy. In December 1930, Brownlee asked John Lymburn, his attorney-general, {{to prepare}} a list of known Communist leaders so he could arrange for their {{deportation}} where possible. [...] He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist, including the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association and the Farmers' Unity League. [...] In December 1932, labour organizers staged a [...] "Hunger March", at which 1,000 unemployed met in Edmonton's Market Square and marched to the legislature building. [...] Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up. [...] While he pronounced himself willing {{to meet with a}} delegation of the march's leaders, he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it.</b> [...] One participant said [...] "A lot of us understood that [...] couldn't do too much, but we figured since it's a farmers' government, least he can do is come out and explain.

Like {{many of the other}} songs she wrote early on, the song {{describes}} the unhappiness and loneliness Swift felt when her love of country music alienated her from her peers. Swift wrote [...] "Tied Together with a Smile" [...] the day she learned one of her best friends was bulimic, a fact which shocked her. She recalled, [...] "How can somebody that seems so strong have such a horrible, horrible weakness? Something that is killing her." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Tied Together with a Smile" [...] describe a beautiful girl trying to hide her inner turbulence and mourn that [...] "You're tied together with a smile/But you're coming undone".

[...] She wrote [...] "Should've Said No" [...] according to [...] "something really, really dramatic and crazy happening to [...] and [...] needing <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it</b> in the form of music".

500|$|Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up, is [...] "largely a {{selection}} of his best blog postings {{over the past few}} years related to climate change issues". TreeHugger describes the book as [...] "a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change, the media that so badly neglects it, the politicians who attempt <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it</b> (and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore [...] science), and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess." [...] In 2011, Romm sat on the panel of the Green Car Summit of the Washington Auto Show. His 2012 book, Language Intelligence, concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric. [...] Ed Markey commented on the book, [...] "Joe masterfully ... scripts ways to master the metaphor, and incorporate irony. Solutions the reader can use for speeches, social media, or just winning the debate around the kitchen table." [...] Romm wrote an article for Time magazine in August 2012 using the research from Language Intelligence to analyze whether Mitt Romney or Barack Obama is the more effective communicator. In speeches and lectures since then, Romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book (instead of their usual, technical, neutral style) to better explain the dangers of, and solutions to, climate change to lay people and the media.|$|E
500|$|At one point, the {{principal}} male characters congregate {{in an alley}} behind Johnny's apartment to play catch with a football while wearing tuxedos. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, and the camera slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the scene has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly when the men decide to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene that he decided <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it</b> on a Q segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau only states that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging. Greg Sestero has been questioned {{about the significance of}} Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was [...] "if people only knew." [...] Sestero describes in The Disaster Artist that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set just so that Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark [...] "Babyface," [...] Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero, and that the revealing of beardless Mark would be [...] "a moment". Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.|$|E
500|$|Takeda {{was first}} shown the project while {{still working on}} Xenosaga: The Animation, a work load he {{estimated}} at six months. Once work on the anime had finished, Takeda and Takahashi began work on the script. Takahashi created the draft based on his original plans for the Xenosaga storyline, which had needed substantial alteration for the original Episode I and Episode II due to both design and time limitations. The scenario for Episode I required little alteration as it was relatively unaltered from Takahashi's initial draft. For Episode II, more substantial alterations were made such as rearranging flashback sequences so the story would maintain an uninterrupted flow, and greatly expanding information concerning the Immigrant Fleet faction and the origins of central character Jr.. During the [...] "beta" [...] period of script development, the scenario for Episode II only made up 30% of the whole game, which {{was seen as a}} drastic imbalance requiring rewrites <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>it.</b> To better connect the two storylines, characters from Episode II were given minor cameos within the events of Episode I. A major change was the shift to the viewpoint of main protagonist Shion Uzuki, as Episode II originally portrayed events from the perspective of Jr., a concession that enabled events to be fleshed out. Despite these changes, keeping the narrative consistent with the in-development Xenosaga Episode III was a necessity. Ultimately the scenario came close to what Takahashi originally intended for Episode I and Episode II. The total writing work on Xenosaga I & II lasted over six months, with Takeda needing to visit Monolith Soft's offices once a week to discuss the script.|$|E
