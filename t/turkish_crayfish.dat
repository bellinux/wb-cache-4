40|$|In Austria, three {{indigenous}} crayfish species occur: {{the noble}} crayfish (Astacus astacus), the stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium), and the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). It {{is not known}} if Astacus leptodactylus is autochthonous in the very eastern part of Austria, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia. In other parts of Austria the <b>Turkish</b> <b>crayfish</b> has been transplanted into several gravel pits and ponds. Up to now, the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is not known {{to occur in the}} wild, but can be bought alive in fish markets, restaurants, and the aquarium trade. The Nearctic spiny-cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) and the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) have been introduced since the 1970 s by crayfish farmers because these species are resistant to the crayfish plague fungus (Aphanomyces astaci). There are just a few populations of O. limosus, and the species is not spreading actively. However, P. leniusculus is widespread all over Austria, and was illegally introduced from one water body to another. It can be characterized as an aggressive, invasive North American species, spreading actively and acting as a vector o...|$|E
40|$|Amphibians {{are known}} to exhibit {{phenotypic}} plasticity in response to variations in predation pressure. Data also indicate that developmental changes can be induced by embryonic exposures to predator non-contact cues. However, the possible consequences of such exposures on larval behavioural activity and sensitivity to chemical cues from predators have remained unexplored. These laboratory experiments {{examine the effects of}} predation cues experienced during embryonic development on some morphological and behavioural traits in hatchlings and tadpoles of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Eggs were raised until hatching in the nonlethal presence of either a sympatric predator (larval spotted salamander, Salamandra salamandra), or an allopatric predator (juvenile <b>Turkish</b> <b>crayfish,</b> Astacus leptodactylus), or crushed conspecific tadpoles. Predators were kept either starved, or fed with R. temporaria tadpoles. Embryonic treatments had significant consequences on weight and total length of hatchlings, {{as well as on the}} general activity of tadpoles. Olfactometric tests showed that the behavioural responses of tadpoles to chemical cues from the two predators tested were not significantly affected by embryonic treatments. In contrast, embryonic experience showed a significant influence on the behavioural response of tadpoles to chemical cues from crushed conspecifics. These results indicate that the morphology of hatchlings depends on the species and diet of the predators present during embryonic development and demonstrate for the first time that the subsequent activity and chemically mediated antipredator behaviour of tadpoles can be influenced by embryonic experience of the predation risk...|$|E
40|$|In August 24 th- August 30 th, 2012 period {{there was}} {{performed}} {{a pilot study}} to assess the Slender clawded or <b>Turkish</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823) populations from Golovița Lake and {{the southern part of}} the Razim Lake (both of them located in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve - DDBR). There were used 10 sets of traps (each set with 10 traps) and after 147 – 149 hours of functioning there were captured 45 specimens of A. leptodactylus, the total biomass of the crayfish being 1, 768 g, which is a very low if compared with the official crayfish-quotas issued for various other regions of the DDBR. The scarcity in Astacus leptodactylus of the Razim- Sinoie lagoonary area is probably due to the habitat-requirement of this species (although other stressing factors – as plagues affecting the crayfish– could also be considered to explain the phenomenon). In order to harvest the minimum quantity (100 kg) of crayfish issued as official quota in case of various other regions of the DDBR, the method involving 10 sets with 10 traps should be continuously used for about 370 days – the costs of activities for such long period (combined with the fact that in case of the exploited crayfish quantities there have to be paid various taxes for the environmental protection authorities) makes economically unprofitable the crayfish stock-harvesting (based on the method used in the present study) in the Razim and Golovița lakes...|$|E
40|$|In {{amphibians}} and fishes, {{evidence is}} increasing that chemical cues from injured conspecifics {{can play a}} role in the chemical labelling and learned recognition of unfamiliar predators. In this laboratory study, we tested the prediction that prior chemical exposure to a non-native predator feeding on conspecific tadpoles will subsequently allow tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) to recognize the chemical cues specifically released by this starved predator. Furthermore, we investigated the vulnerability of this chemically-mediated process to herbicide contamination. With these aims in view, groups of tadpoles were kept either unexposed or exposed for ten days to chemical cues from <b>Turkish</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Astacus leptodactylus) previously fed on tadpoles, both in uncontaminated water and in the presence of four sublethal concentrations of amitrole (0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg. l− 1). We then assessed the effects of the six conditioning treatments on general activity and behavioural response to chemical cues from starved crayfish. Larval treatments did not affect the general activity of the tadpoles. By contrast, the treatments had significant effects on the behavioural response to the test solution prepared form starved crayfish. The only tadpoles to show an antipredator behavioural response to the chemical stimulation from starved crayfish belonged to the groups derived from chemical exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in uncontaminated water and in contaminated water with the lowest concentration of amitrole (0. 01 mg. l− 1). Conversely, this chemical stimulation produced no behavioural change in the control group or in the groups derived from exposure to tadpole-fed crayfish in contaminated water containing 0. 1, 1 and 10 mg. l− 1 of amitrole. This study demonstrates that chemical cues released during the predator’s feeding activity can subsequently be used by common toad tadpoles in the recognition of an unfamiliar predator. In addition, our results show that the presence of sublethal amitrole concentrations can impair this recognition process. Such a pesticide effect might be especially detrimental for amphibian populations threatened by invasive predators...|$|E

It can be characterized as an aggressive, invasive North American species, spreading actively and acting as a vector of the crayfish plague. Unfortunately the habitat requirements of the native noble crayfish and the alien signal crayfish are nearly the same. Case studies are given in the following chapters: the first group of examples refers to water bodies where the alien signal crayfish is most probably the cause of displacement of the indigenous noble crayfish: 1) Hintersee, 2) Irrsee (« Zeller See »), 3) north-western Lower Austria (« Waldviertel »), 4) Merzenstein (aquacultural enterprise), 5) Neufelder See. The second group of examples refers to water bodies where alien and indigenous species are able to coexist: a) the confluence of the main course of the Danube River, the Ölhafen and the Neue Donau in the southeast part of Vienna, b) the Schönauer Wasser, a backwater of the Danube River downstream Vienna, c) backwaters and ox bows of the Morava River. The differences between these two groups are analysed, and it is speculated on possible causes allowing coexistence. Some conclusions are drawn. Important actions related to the protection of native crayfish are briefly discussed...|$|E
