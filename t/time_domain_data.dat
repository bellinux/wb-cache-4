40|$|Friction is a {{performance}} limiting factor in many industrial motion systems. Correct compensation or control of friction and other nonlinearities is generally difficult. Apart from {{the complex nature}} of friction, compensation {{of even the most}} basic type of friction, Coulomb friction, is non trivial. Most available tuning methods rely on <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> <b>data</b> and are often unable to distinguish between nonlinear effects of friction and that of for example linear viscous damping. Furthermore, the sensitivity of <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> <b>data</b> to the influence of friction is too low for correct tuning in many of the high precision motion applications currently used in industry. In this paper a frequency domain method is introduced that allows fast and high accuracy tuning of controller parameters when the closed loop system is subject to nonlinear influences. This methodology is applied to optimally compensate friction in a high precision motion stage of a transmission electron microscope.

40|$|A new robust {{identification}} {{framework that}} incorporates both <b>time</b> and frequency <b>domain</b> <b>data</b> is proposed. his framework avoids situations where a good data fit in one domain leads to poor fitting in the other. Key Words—Robust identification; control oriented identification; interpolation; convex optimization; Linear Matrix Inequalities. Abstract—In this {{paper we propose}} a new robust identification framework that combines both frequency and time-domain experimental data. The main result of the paper shows that the problem of obtaining a nominal model consistent with the experimental data and bounds on the identification error can be recast as a constrained finite-dimensional convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using Linear Matrix Inequalities techniques. This approach, based upon a generalized interpolation theory, contains as special cases the Carathéodory—Fejér (purely time-domain) and Nevanlinna— Pick (purely frequency-domain) problems. The proposed procedure interpolates the frequency and <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> experimental <b>data</b> while restricting the identified system to be in an a priori given class of models, resulting in a nominal model consistent with both sources of data. Thus, it is convergent and optimal up to a factor of two (with respect to central algorithms). � 199...|$|R

First, parameter retrieval in the Legendre domain is typically two orders of magnitude faster than direct fitting in the <b>time</b> <b>domain.</b> Second, <b>data</b> fitting in a low-dimensional Legendre space yields estimates for amplitudes and time constants which are, on the average, more precise compared to least-squares-fitting with equal weights in the <b>time</b> <b>domain.</b> Third, the Legendre analysis of two exponentials gives satisfactory estimates in parameter ranges where least-squares-fitting in the <b>time</b> <b>domain</b> typically fails.
