5000|$|The SAM riboswitch (also {{known as}} the S-box leader and now also called the SAM-I riboswitch) is found {{upstream}} {{of a number of}} genes which code for proteins involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Two SAM riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis that were experimentally studied act at the level of transcription <b>termination</b> <b>control.</b> The predicted secondary structure consists of a complex stem-loop region followed by a single stem-loop terminator region. An alternative and mutually exclusive form involves bases in the 3' segment of helix 1 with those in the 5' region of helix 5 to form a structure termed the anti-terminator form. [...] When SAM is unbound, the anti-terminator sequence sequesters the terminator sequence so the terminator is unable to form, allowing the polymerase read-through the downstream gene. When the SAM is bound to the aptamer, the anti-terminator is sequestered by an anti-anti-terminator; the terminator forms and terminates the transcription. However, many SAM riboswitches are likely to regulate gene expression at the level of translation.|$|E

After a short pause, the termination signal appears in RNA as a hairpin that destabilizes the elongation complex (EC). We demonstrate that negative and positive <b>termination</b> factors <b>control</b> the efficiency of termination primarily through a direct modulation of hairpin folding and, to a much lesser extent, by changing pausing at the point of <b>termination.</b> The mechanism <b>controlling</b> hairpin formation at the termination point relies on weak protein interactions with single-stranded RNA, which corresponds to the upstream portion of the hairpin. Escherichia coli NusA protein destabilizes these interactions and thus promotes hairpin folding and termination. Stabilization of these contacts by phage λ N protein leads to antitermination...|$|R

PCN encompasses two complementary functions: admission control of new flows and termination of some admitted flows when the available capacity is unexpectedly reduced after a network failure. Its simple structure and ad-hoc measurementbased nature warrant careful exploration of its applicability. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of two proposals that implement PCN, CL-PHB and Single-Marking. We showed that CL-PHB works reliably for both admission and <b>termination</b> <b>control,</b> which in turn demonstrates that the PCN framework is a viable architecture to provide QoS to inelastic real-time traffic.

40|$|The T box {{transcription}} <b>termination</b> <b>control</b> {{system is}} used in Gram-positive bacteria to regulate expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and other amino acid-related genes. Readthrough of a transcriptional terminator located in the leader region of the target gene is dependent on a specific interaction between the nascent leader transcript and the cognate uncharged tRNA. This interaction is required for formation of an antiterminator structure in the leader, which prevents formation of a competing transcriptional terminator stem–loop. The antiterminators and terminators of genes in this family are highly conserved in both secondary structure and primary sequence; the antiterminator contains the T box sequence, {{which is the most}} highly conserved leader element. These conserved features were investigated by phylogenetic and mutational analysis. Changes at highly conserved positions in the bulge and in the helix above the bulge reduced function, while alteration of other positions that were as much as 96 % conserved did not have a major effect.

Comparative analyses revealed a small RNA secondary structural element, designated the GA motif, that is highly conserved in both T box and S box leader sequences. The motif consists of two short helices separated by an asymmetric internal loop, with highly conserved GA dinucleotide sequences {{on either side of}} the internal loop. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif in model T and S box leader sequences indicated that it is essential for transcriptional regulation in both systems.

40|$|Expression of the {{tryptophan}} operon of Escherichia coli {{is regulated}} over about a 500 - to 600 -fold range by the combined action of repression and attenuation. Repression regulates transcription initiation {{in response to}} variation in the intracellular concentration of tryptophan. Attenuation regulates transcription termination at a site in the leader region of the operon in response {{to changes in the}} extent of charging of tRNATrp. We measured repression independently of attenuation to ascertain whether these regulatory mechanisms were used differentially by the bacterium as the severity of tryptophan starvation was increased. We found that repression regulated transcription of the operon over the range from growth with excess tryptophan to growth under moderate tryptophan starvation. By contrast, attenuation (<b>termination</b> <b>control)</b> was not relaxed until tryptophan starvation was in the moderate-to-severe range. Thus, attenuation and repression were used to regulate transcription in response to different degrees of tryptophan deprivation. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that when tryptophan starvation was sufficient to relieve repression 50 to 60 %, 65 % of the tRNATrp of the bacterium was charged. These findings provide a possible explanation for the existence of only two tryptophan codons in the coding region for the trp leader peptide of Enterobacteriaceae...|$|E

In further developing this as a system for studying eucaryotic <b>termination</b> <b>control,</b> we found that prematurely terminated transcripts of 175 and 120 nucleotides also occur in adenovirus type 5 -infected cells. In both cases, premature termination occurs temporally, being found only during late times of infection, not at early times before DNA replication or immediately after the onset of DNA replication when late gene expression has begun (intermediate times). To examine the phenomenon of premature termination further, a temperature-sensitive mutant virus, adenovirus type 5 ts 107, was used to uncouple DNA replication and transcription. DNA replication is defective in this mutant at restrictive temperatures. We found that premature termination is inducible at intermediate times by shifting from a permissive temperature to a restrictive temperature, allowing continuous transcription {{in the absence of}} continuous DNA replication. No premature termination occurs when the temperature is shifted up at early times before DNA replication.

The random walker, which can be used to disseminate or collect information, visits the nodes while selecting randomly one of the neighbors. The selection of neighbors is effected by the neighbor density or the connectivity degree of the nodes. The connectivity degree in turn depends on the radius of transmission of wireless nodes. In this paper we studied the coverage process of the RW on random geometric graph. The random geometric graphs are often considered as a model for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. We defined and studied a metric called "attenuation" that indicates how fast a RW can move in the network while disseminating or collecting information. We showed that attenuation depends on the topology, the number of nodes in a network and the transmission radius of the nodes. We then studied the effect of attenuation on the RW coverage process analytically and through simulations and showed that attenuation is the normalized estimated search time of the network. In the end we applied the results obtained to show that the estimated search time in random geometric graphs is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of replicated targets. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

The scattering between longitudinal and flexural waves is particularly strong in a frequency range which is determined by the dimensions and material of the asymmetric mass. A test is introduced to ensure that the scattering matrix is conservative. A theoretical formulation of active control is developed, which is based on a matrix approach for wave propagation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} {{regulation of the}} genes involved in the biosynthesis of cysteine are poorly characterized in Bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria. In this study we describe the expression pattern of the B. subtilis cysH operon in response to sulfur starvation. A 6. 1 -kb polycistronic transcript which includes the cysH, cysP, ylnB, ylnC, ylnD, ylnE, and ylnF genes was identified. Its synthesis was induced by sulfur limitation and strongly repressed by cysteine. The cysH operon contains a 5 ′ leader portion homologous {{to that of the}} S box family of genes involved in sulfur metabolism, which are regulated by a transcription <b>termination</b> <b>control</b> system. Here we show that induction of B. subtilis cysH operon expression is dependent on the promoter and independent of the leader region terminator, indicating that the operon is regulated at the level of transcription initiation rather than controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. Deletion of a 46 -bp region adjacent to the − 35 region of the cysH promoter led to high-level expression of the operon, even in the presence of cysteine. We also found that O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS), a direct precursor of cysteine, renders cysH transcription independent of sulfur starvation and insensitive to cysteine repression. We propose that transcription of the cysH operon is negatively regulated by a transcriptional repressor whose activity is controlled by the intracellular levels of OAS. Cysteine is predicted to repress transcription by inhibiting the synthesis of OAS, which would act as an inducer of cysH expression. These novel results provide the first direct evidence that cysteine biosynthesis is controlled at a transcriptional level by both negative and positive effectors in a gram-positive organism...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems, multiple standards {{have been implemented}} to meet {{the past and present}} demands of different applications. This proliferation of wireless standards, operating over multiple frequency bands, has increased the demand for radio frequency (RF) components, and consequently power amplifiers (PA) to operate over multiple frequency bands. In this research work, a systematic approach for the synthesis of a novel dual-band matching network is proposed and applied for effective design of PA capable of maintaining high power efficiency at two arbitrary widely spaced frequencies. The proposed dual-band matching network incorporates two different stages. The first one aims at transforming the targeted two complex impedances, at the two operating frequencies, to a real one. The second stage is a dual-band filter that ensures the matching of the former real impedance to the termination impedance to 50 Ohm. Furthermore, an additional transmission line is incorporated between the two previously mentioned stages to adjust the impedances at the second and third harmonics without altering the impedances seen at the fundamental frequencies. Although simple, the harmonic <b>termination</b> <b>control</b> is very effective in enhancing the efficiency of RF transistors, especially when exploiting the Class J design space. The proposed dual-band matching network synthesis methodology was applied to design a dual-band power amplifier using a packaged 45 W gallium nitride (GaN) transistor. The power amplifier prototype maintained a peak power efficiency of about 68 % at the two operating frequencies, namely 800 MHz and 1. 9 GHz. In addition, a Volterra based digital predistortion technique has been successfully applied to linearize the PA response around the two operating frequencies.

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{research}} has recently been directed at analyzing the relationship between population density {{and the perception of}} crowding. This research was reviewed by outlining the variables that have been shown to increase (input overload, behavioral interference, and personal space violations) and decrease (activity and <b>termination</b> <b>control)</b> the perception of crowding. It was then proposed that affective variables, as well as cognitive and behavioral variables, have a significant influence on the perception of crowding. In order to test for the effects of affective and cognitive variables on the perception of crowding, a short-term high density laboratory experiment was conducted. In this experiment, individuals in all-male, all-female, or mixed-sex groups, were exposed to a positive, neutral or negative mood-inducing film. In addition, half of the participants were given perceived control over the experience, while the remainder were given no such information. It was predicted that a positive mood-inducer would decrease perception of crowding and a negative mood-inducer would increase the perception of crowding for individuals in a high density setting. The results only partially support this prediction. Positive mood decreased perception of crowding, but only for individuals in mixed-sex groups. Mood variations had no other reliable effects on the perception of crowding. It was also predicted that individuals with perceived control would report feeling less crowded than individuals without control. This prediction was supported in only the most limited conditions. Individuals in all-women groups, sitting in middle seats, and with perceived control reported feeling less crowded than did comparable individuals without perceived control. It was also predicted that mood and perceived control would interact to affect the perception of crowding. The results failed to support this prediction. A variety of theoretical and methodological explanations for these results were examined. It was concluded that mood variations, heretofore ignored in the literature, can influence the perception of crowding, especially when stemming directly from the high density experience. Conclusions about the effect of perceived control on the perception of crowding (commonly accepted in the current literature) should be re-examined before general acceptance...|$|E
