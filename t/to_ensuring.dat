5|$|The {{deposition}} (and eventual murder) of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba caused further {{issues in}} the country, leading to the declaration of a rival government in Stanleyville {{by the end of}} the year. To prevent a complete collapse of order within the country, the United Nations established a major peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Operation in the Congo (known under its French acronym as ONUC). In addition to a large body of troops (20,000 at its peak strength), a civilian mission was brought in to provide technical assistance to the Congolese government. Initially, ONUC limited its actions <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> the safety of Congolese citizens and foreign nationals and withheld from acting against the secessionist states, but the UN ran into trouble in Katanga. The state's leader and head of the locally entrenched Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), Moïse Tshombe, at first banned the UN from entering his territory and then greatly limited their peacekeeping efforts. Further issues derived from peacekeepers' attempts to deport foreign mercenaries, many of whom were employed by Katanga.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles.
