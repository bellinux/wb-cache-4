From 1946 to 1951 he was Commissioner of shipping, the press, communication, labor and social security. He voted for Algerian independence on 27 August 1947 and {{for the establishment of}} a Council of Europe on 9 July 1949.|$|E

5|$|Broadhurst Park has 50–60 car parking spaces, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> match days {{these are}} only {{available}} via booking in advance. The stadium is also served by Newton Heath and Moston tram stop (tram/light rail), Moston railway station (heavy rail), and several bus routes, including match day special buses from the city's Northern Quarter. 80 bicycle stands have also been installed by the club to encourage cycling to the ground.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|Prenton Park {{has seen}} the number of {{supporters}} rise and fall considerably over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium on 11 March 1912, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8–0. Early attendances varied from 5,000 to 8,000, <b>though,</b> <b>on</b> Boxing Day 1921, 11,137 supporters came to see Tranmere take on Bolton Wanderers Reserves. Tranmere entered The Football League the next season, and 7,011 watched their first game against Crewe Alexandra F.C.. There was an average of 6,000 in attendance at home games, before the Football League was suspended {{as a result of}} the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even <b>though</b> <b>on</b> Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} past their best. The Potters {{struggled}} near the foot of the First Division table in the 1967–68 and 1968–69 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969–70 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal {{has been}} the highest rank in the British Army since 1736. A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, it is {{equivalent}} to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF). A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown. Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> half-pay when not in an appointment. The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased). After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post. Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment.|$|E

5|$|He did {{not play}} in the England's 7–1 defeat to Hungary in Budapest in May 1954. However {{he was in the}} squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland. Matthews helped England to a 4–4 draw with Belgium, though was left out of a win over Switzerland, before he {{returned}} to the first XI as England crashed out of the competition with a 4–2 defeat to Uruguay at the St. Jakob Stadium after mistakes from goalkeeper Gil Merrick. His third match of the year was a 2–0 win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park in the 1955 British Home Championship, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> the pitch he did not gel well with Don Revie. Matthews then put in a superb in a 2–0 win over the Welsh, before he helped England to record a 3–1 victory over World Champions West Germany, though only three of the Germans used at Wembley had been in the first XI in the World Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, <b>though,</b> <b>on</b> their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|However, even <b>though</b> <b>on</b> a per-individual basis, {{many other}} species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, Grove {{played two}} {{games for the}} White Sox, {{pitching}} seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings. He spent {{the start of the}} 1941 season at Oklahoma City, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> May 19 he was sent to the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League, where he {{spent the rest of the}} season. Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not think much of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.|$|E
5|$|In the 21stcentury, Kirkcaldy {{remains an}} {{important}} centre for the surrounding areas, with a Museum and Art Gallery, three public parks and shopping facilities. The town also hosts the annual Links Market, {{commonly known as}} Europe's longest street fair. The production of linoleum continues, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> a greatly reduced scale, under Swiss ownership (Forbo Holding AG). Kirkcaldy Harbour, which closed in 1992, re-opened in October 2011 to cargo ships. A project between Carr's Flour Mills, the parent of Hutchison's, Forth Ports (owners of the harbour) and Transport Scotland, will allow Carr's to bring in wheat via the harbour and remove {{a quarter of its}} lorries from the roads every year.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, <b>though</b> <b>on</b> rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E
