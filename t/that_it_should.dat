5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> name Sicily and another location as cover, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her success}} with Smack the Pony, Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only {{requirement}} was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{have enough of}} a narrative thread {{to make it more}} of a sitcom than a sketch show.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{the court}} {{reasoned}} that Hemi's {{decision not to}} do business with New York indicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have foreseen being brought to court in Illinois for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, the Soviet Union {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> join NATO {{to preserve}} peace in Europe. The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was {{to weaken the}} alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E
5|$|Randolph adopted two {{rules in}} {{preparing}} his initial outline: that the Constitution should only include essential principles, avoiding minor provisions {{that would change}} over time, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be stated in simple and precise language.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{because she}} says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is to be}} so. You don't know how generous she is. She says <b>that</b> if <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be so, she will give me ever so much money;--two {{thousand}} pounds!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But,' {{replied the}} Bishop, 'if {{you think about}} doing a thing of <b>that</b> sort, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be put off till you are getting on in life. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> be done with your full {{strength}} and vigour.' ...|$|R
5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region and claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{be part of}} Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu {{to discuss the issue}} with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E
5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen. It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It {{was used as a}} textbook until 1855.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} break the siege failed, with around 290 {{casualties}} out of around 415 men. Shortly afterwards, a second relief effort consisting of 225 men and three artillery guns—carried out despite specific orders <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not take place—dispersed the forces surrounding the building, suffering two casualties, and the besieged party escaped. Only {{one member of the}} besieged group was injured.|$|E

50|$|Fox {{officials}} were keen {{that the sound}} of their new widescreen film format should be as impressive as the picture, and <b>that</b> meant <b>it</b> <b>should</b> include true stereophonic sound.|$|R

5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be fought and won. In addition {{to the production of}} alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so {{precious}} {{that she should}} always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite. His thesis was that the lie (the cover plan) was so precious <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be flanked with an escort of truths.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel very}} {{strongly}} that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.|$|E
50|$|A full PACS {{should provide}} a single point of access for images and their {{associated}} data. <b>That</b> is, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> support all digital modalities, in all departments, throughout the enterprise.|$|R

50|$|The {{work also}} {{moves to a}} general {{conclusion}} on the occult, namely <b>that</b> while <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be avoided for reasons already given by the Church Fathers, its practitioners should not be executed.|$|R
5|$|Jack Bros. {{was well}} {{received}} in retrospective reviews, with multiple critics calling {{it one of}} the best Virtual Boy games; some thought it was held back by the platform, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be made available on other platforms, such as the Nintendo 3DS. In 2003, the staff at Tips & Tricks stated it to be the most uncommon North American Virtual Boy release, giving it a rarity rating of 6/10 based on a consultation with Digital Press.|$|E
5|$|The Cattle Dog breed {{standard}} states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, {{and that its}} appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.|$|E
5|$|The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho is {{dedicated}} to Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though three-faced, an inscription in the temple suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be considered four-faced. It also records a legend where Kapila and other demons conjoined together in a single form and were blessed by Brahma that only someone in the same form could slay them so Vishnu {{took the form of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The presence of the Lakshamana Temple in Khajuraho suggests worship in the Chandela kingdom in the 10th century.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, however, {{were not}} at all of this opinion, and they agreed <b>that,</b> if <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be in their power, they would see to <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Dusantes lost nothing by this close-fisted missionary.|$|R
3000|$|... the {{coordinator}} {{should be designed}} {{in such a way}} to prevent the risk of creating bottlenecks – <b>that</b> is, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be logically “central”, but possibly distributed at the implementation level if appropriate; [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Former Prime Minister John Howard has said, [...] "What’s {{disappointed}} me is {{an issue}} like Safe Schools. When <b>that</b> emerged <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have been hit on the head by centre-right governments at federal and state level".|$|R
5|$|The Minor Planet Center classifies the trans-Neptunian object 90377 Sedna as a scattered-disc object. Its {{discoverer}} Michael E. Brown {{has suggested}} instead <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{be considered an}} inner Oort-cloud object rather than {{a member of the}} scattered disc, because, with a perihelion distance of 76 AU, it is too remote to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{school building}} in Fore Street {{was built in}} 1583 a private residence for William Symes of Poundisford. In 1671 his youngest son, John, conveyed the property to 12 trustees so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be converted into a grammar school - according to his father's wish.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it seem like it was a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E
