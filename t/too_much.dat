5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked <b>too</b> <b>much</b> or too loudly, boasted <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized {{a new form of}} lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
60|$|And {{that day}} was not long in coming; indeed, it came with terrible alacrity; <b>much</b> <b>too</b> quickly for Gertrude, <b>much</b> <b>too</b> quickly for Norman; and <b>much</b> <b>too</b> quickly for Alaric's lawyer.

60|$|And so we held on, gliding {{with the}} stream. It drove {{us to this}} bank, and it drove us to that bank, and it turned us, and whirled us; but yet it carried us on. Sometimes <b>much</b> <b>too</b> slowly; {{sometimes}} <b>much</b> <b>too</b> fast, but yet it carried us on.|$|R

Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with <b>too</b> <b>much</b> passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} the vacuum energy of quantum fields is briefly reviewed.

Backreaction models are reviewed, and the question of whether quantum effects can react against a cosmological constant is discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> Too Soon is the 1974 second studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. The group was {{dissatisfied}} with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album, leading the band's frontman David Johansen to enlist veteran producer Shadow Morton for <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> Too Soon. Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed {{to work with them}} as a challenge. They recorded the album the following year at A Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> Too Soon was {{released}} by Mercury Records on May 10, 1974, to poor sales and only charted at number 167 on the Billboard 200. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded a few years later. The album received positive reviews from most critics, some of whom felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound {{and made it a}} better record than their first. Like their debut album, <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> Too Soon {{became one of the most}} popular cult records in rock music and has since been viewed by music journalists as a precursor to punk rock.|$|E
5|$|A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was {{developed}} by Swedish studio Legendo Entertainment and released in July 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the literature on}} research studies in informatics and changes in learning, particularly computer-assisted instruction. Research results themselves are often inconclusive when no allowances are made for different generations of hardware and software or computer types, when the computer is treated as the only variable in the scenario, or when the epistemological roots of classroom practice are not acknowledged. Contradictory commentary springs from the fundamental dichotomy between the mechanistic and constructivist approaches. Their vastly different perspectives create disagreement over whether classroom computers actually affect cognition, and for how long. (Contains 31 references.)
