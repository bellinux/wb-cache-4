The nomex honeycomb reinforces the kevlar/carbon fibre {{inner and outer}} frames. Empacher uses a vacuum bag technique to bond the outer layers with the honeycomb core. Combining kevlar and epoxy resin creates a <b>tear</b> and impact <b>resistant</b> outer shell. Empacher reinforces the gunwale with an additional carbon layer and carbon foam frames.|$|R
50|$|Boots {{are worn}} by {{motorcycle}} riders and passengers {{to prevent or}} reduce harm {{to their feet and}} ankles while riding and {{in the event of a}} crash. They are designed using materials and seam construction that are impact, abrasion, cut, <b>tear</b> and burst <b>resistant.</b> Tough, strong, moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks. Boots with oil-resistant, rubber-based composite soles give a grip on the pavement and help keep the rider's feet on the pegs. Boots may also have energy absorbers and load spreaders on the shin, inside and outside of each ankle. A stiff sole working laterally helps prevent or decrease crash injuries caused by crushing and shear strain. For boots, the European Standard is EN 13634:2002.|$|R

50|$|Aluminium makes brass {{stronger}} and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in seawater applications (naval brasses). Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass wear and <b>tear</b> <b>resistant.</b>|$|E
40|$|Unsupported films cast {{from water}} {{solutions}} of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and plasticizer are transparent, tough, <b>tear</b> and puncture <b>resistant,</b> resistant to oils and impermeability to most gases. PVA is apt for production of environmentally friendly items. Due to strong intermolecular forces PVA has {{high mechanical strength}} (tensile strength B > 80 MPa), though small deformability (elongation at break B < 5 %). The last one is considered as the constitutive drawback of polymers, which are intended to use for films preparation. PVA plasticizing by hydroxyl groups containing mostly low-molecular substances (glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol etc.) is recognized trend of weakening of too high intermolecular interaction. Development of PVA blends with another more deformable polymeric counter component could turn out efficient. Poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was chosen as a counter component...|$|R

5000|$|Nerve {{guidance}} channels, Nerve guidance conduit are innovative strategies {{focusing on}} larger defects {{that provide a}} conduit for sprouting axons directing growth and reducing growth inhibition from scar tissue. Nerve guidance channels must be readily formed into a conduit with the desired dimensions, sterilizable, <b>tear</b> <b>resistant,</b> and easy to handle and suture (Schmidt & Leach 2003). Ideally they would degrade over time with nerve regeneration, be pliable, semipermeable, maintain their shape, and have a smooth inner wall that mimics that of a real nerve (Schmidt & Leach 2003).|$|E

50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} {{also provide}} another method for tissue regeneration {{in which the}} graft's chemical and physical properties can be controlled. Since the properties of a material may be specified for {{the situation in which}} it is being used, synthetic materials are an attractive option for PNS regeneration. The use of synthetic materials come with certain concerns, such as: easy formation of the graft material into the necessary dimensions, biodegradable, sterilizable, <b>tear</b> <b>resistant,</b> easy to operate with, low risk of infection, and low inflammation response due to the material. The material must also maintain the channel during the nerve regeneration. Currently, the materials most commonly researched mainly focus on polyesters, but biodegradable polyurethane, other polymers, and biodegradable glass are also being investigated. Other possibilities for synthetic materials are conducting polymers and polymers biologically modified to promote cell axon growth and maintain the axon channel.|$|E
50|$|Quebracho {{produces}} tannins {{that can}} be extracted in quebracho sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and white quebracho (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E

40|$|Construction {{drawings}} {{are vital}} tools that contractors need {{to complete a}} building project. Drawings are used constantly on the construction site in all types of weather. Often, these drawings become wet, torn, faded and generally damaged beyond use. If this damage is significant, errors in plan reading are possible. Many contractors also report purchasing multiple sets of drawings for the same project. These additional sets of drawings add costs to the project. Technology is now available to {{extend the life of}} drawings which uses <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> paper and a water resistant printing method. Of the potential cost savings on the job, the direct reprinting costs are the easiest to quantify. This study seeks to quantify the cost difference currently available on the market for several specific projects. First, the weather and <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> drawings are discussed. Second, a review of the use of different types of drawings on the jobsite was made, and key areas that would benefit from the use of more durable drawings are identified. The study analyzed the drawings on several types of projects to evaluate the cost benefit relationships. Results indicate that the technology may be marginally beneficial for smaller projects. For larger projects, the benefit of durable drawings appears more significant when compared to the overall costs of the project...|$|E
40|$|Personnel injury {{from flying}} glass {{produced}} during an explosion accident can represent a significant hazard, often {{in excess of}} hazards due to airblast, primary fragments, building collapse, and secondary fragments. The permissible overpressure in Inhabited Building Distance (IBD) from a Potential Explosion Site (PES) is 1. 2 psi. This pressure is sufficient to cause failure of most windows in conventional construction. Failure of these windows can produce hazardous glass shards which can cause serious injury. A research program was initiated {{to address this issue}} and develop cost effective methods for mitigating the hazards. The program was designed to address blast loads with a peak pressure up to 7 psi. Anchored widow film systems were designed and tested for low pressure applications. These methods showed a significant increase in blast capacity and reduction in glass fragment hazard. A catch system was developed to arrest the flight of unanchored, filmed panes for blast loads at {{the upper end of the}} design range. An analytical method was developed for these capacity enhancement systems. Over 60 validation tests were performed to verify the analytical methods. These tests included evaluation of polyester films, <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> films, and laminated glass. Tests were performed in a shock tube capable of producing long duration blast loads with accurate control over peak pressure...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a {{retrospective}} study of 59 arthroscopic acromioplasties. Objective shoulder assessment was made following the relative Constant score and UCLA rating scale. Subjective satisfaction of the patient was assessed on an analogic scale. The patients were divided into 3 groups, according to the subacromial pathology treated. The first group (27 shoulders in 23 patients) included patients with subacromial impingement without a complete rotator cuff tear. The objective result, between 80 and 90 %, was close to results in others series reported. Distinction between patients with no tear or partial tear of the cuff showed better results for patients with partial tears. This surprising finding may be at least partially {{explained by the fact that}} these patients were older than those without a cuff tear. The results of this study, and the review of the literature, confirmed the value of subacromial decompression as a treatment for impingement without complete cuff <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> to at least 6 months of conservative treatment; comparison between surgical and arthroscopic series showed similar results. The second group (19 shoulders in 19 patients) included patients with impingement and complete cuff tear. The objective results and the literature review led us to specify indications. Subacromial decompression with debridment of the tear has given excellent results in older patients - over 60 for most authors - when the tear was limited. In our study, the function of the shoulder at revision was good when the tear was limited to the supraspinatus and part of the infraspinatus. The third group (13 shoulders in 10 patients) included patients with calcifying tendinitis. Arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed in every case; excision of the calcification was performed in less than half of the cases and did not influence the final result. The calcifications had disappeared at revision in all cases. This may suggest that the treatment of the associated impingement was the most important procedure in these cases.

40|$|Bolts, {{shotcrete}} and mesh {{are today}} {{a part of}} the standard ground support system, although it becomes economically challenging to combine them sufficiently to support seismically active ground that requires increased yielding and energy-absorbing capabilities. An alternative to the current ground support system is the Thin Spray− On Liner (TSL) that may possess significant yielding properties. TSL has the potential ability to support seismically active ground in terms of deformation and rock bursting, common in deep mining. This thesis is {{a part of the}} investigation; to prove whether the current formulation of the Thin Spray− On Liner could be implemented as an alternative ground support system and improve the support capabilities for complex ground types. The thesis will complete and deliver a conclusive trial site results summary. A qualified ground control team put together a set of 11 large-scale trials in an underground environment within an active mine, Nickel Rim South in Sudbury. Each trial examined the geotechnical capabilities with respect to the engineering and health & safety aspects of the TSL. These trials are a Proof of Concept phase towards proving the liner as a superior component in underground rock support. This TSL was developed to achieve the de-bonding, toughness and <b>tear</b> <b>resistant</b> ground support parameters. The thesis focuses on the specific geotechnical testing conducted at the Nickel Rim South Mine during the first quarter of 2012. Subsequent testing has been completed and liner development continues that is not covered within this thesis. Out of the 11 planned tests, 8 were executed during this period, and the rest will be executed later. Some of the results from the test trials are of a long− term nature and therefore the majority of the test results are not yet available. Before any tests could be executed, the isocyanate levels were measured and the results served as a base when setting up the PPE (Personal protective equipment) safety protocol. In addition some practical concerns arose during the trials, which were successfully solved after a few adjustments. The test results available for the full composite liner material concluded that peel− back at the leading edge next to the face blast, together with fly− rock damage, was severe, due to primer adhesion failure and this test was therefore considered to have failed. A comment should made in qualification of the above statement that the leading edge of the PCM(Polymeric Composite Membrane) was not bolted which was contrary to the project scope that suggested treating the PCM much like mesh prior to a blast and the wall was not high-pressure water scaled. The same test was performed on topcoat only, with significant improvement. The coverage of the topcoat only on top of shotcrete is poor, due to the pebbly nature and fibers protruding out from the shotcrete. The robot managed to apply the TSL with sufficient coverage and consistent thickness on the walls and the pillar nose, except for the edges where the guns flip over occurred and missed large perimeter patches, which was not dealt with till later in the testing. These results indicate the requirement of a rehab procedure for damage caused to the liner, although the damage could partly appear due to the fact that the top coat could have been not yet fully cured and in its strength building process at the time of face blast. No determination was made of the PCMs actual strength required at the time of face blast during the cure cycle. There are speculations whether adhesion failure could be diminished by using a higher adhesion primer but without the foaming properties, which would result in a primer with lacking properties to fill the gaps for superior coverage while providing higher adhesion. In addition, bolting of the leading edge could be implemented to partially address the peeling issue. It is however important to investigate that the adhesion fails due to a rock failure and retains the loose material, unlike adhere and tear. The trial results are only investigated on the rock walls, in order to make a fair judgment on the liners performance and capability it should in addition be applied on the shoulders and the back to accomplish full rounds.
