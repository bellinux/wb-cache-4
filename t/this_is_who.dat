Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to [...] "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" [...] and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually [...] "a very secure guy" [...] who does not care about others' opinions of him, [...] "Wheels" [...] sees his friends take his disability for granted: [...] "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> I am, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am {{to be able to get}} up between each take and walk around. I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E

Kuznetsova's mother, Galina Tsareva, is a six-time world champion and holder of 20 world records in cycling, and her brother, Nikolay Kuznetsov, was a silver medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and coach of the Russian cycling team Lokomotiv. Kuznetsova never showed interest in cycling, but rather tennis. She later stated {{in an interview that}} she liked watching tennis from an early age, preferring men's over women's tennis. [...] "I had posters in my room of MaliVai Washington, Marcelo Ríos, and (Yevgeny) Kafelnikov. It's very weird but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> I liked. Later I was a big fan of (Marat) Safin.", she said. Kuznetsova began to play tennis at the age of seven, and moved to Spain six years later to receive better training and coaching. While there, she became fluent in Spanish.|$|E

[...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album. It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> these guys are."
