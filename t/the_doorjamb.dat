25|$|Among {{evidence}} demonstrated toward Heirens's {{guilt is}} the fingerprint {{evidence on the}} Degnan ransom note and on <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> of Frances Brown's bathroom door. However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would find on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "bloody, smudged" [...] {{print of}} {{an end and}} middle joint of a finger was found on <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> of a door between the {{bathroom}} and dressing room in Frances Brown's apartment. A photograph of the print was taken, but no match was made with anything on file. After Heirens was arrested on June 26, his prints were compared with the Degnan note. When Laffey claimed a match with Heirens and the prints on the Degnan note, {{an attempt was made}} to match him with <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> print. It was unsuccessful, and the police declared him cleared of the Brown murder because the print at the crime scene was not his. Twelve days later, however, it was declared to match Heirens's prints to 22 points of comparison, well above the FBI standard.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, 1946, Captain Emmett Evans {{had told}} {{newspapers}} that Heirens {{had been cleared}} of suspicion in the Brown murder as the fingerprint left in the apartment was not his. Twelve days later, Chief of Detectives Walter Storms confirmed that the [...] "bloody smudge" [...] left on <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> was Heirens'.|$|E

2500|$|Police found {{a bloody}} {{fingerprint}} smudge on <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> {{of the entrance}} door. Also, there was a possible eyewitness to the killer's escape. An [...] "eye-witness", George Weinberg, heard gunshots at about 4 am. According to John Derick, the night clerk stationed {{in the lobby of}} the building, a nervous man of 35–40 years old and weighing approximately 140 pounds got off the elevator, fumbled for the door to the street and left.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs—the [...] "mysterious" [...] or [...] "obscure" [...] writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb</b> is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.|$|E
2500|$|While {{handwriting}} analysts did not definitively link Heirens's handwriting to the [...] "Lipstick Message", police {{claimed that}} his fingerprints matched a print discovered {{at the scene}} of the Frances Brown murder. It was first reported as a [...] "bloody smudge" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>doorjamb.</b> Furthermore, a fingerprint of the left little finger also allegedly connected Heirens to the ransom note with nine points of comparison. As Heirens's nine points of comparison were loops, this could also provide a match to 65% of the population. At the time Heirens's supporters pointed out the FBI handbook regarding fingerprint identification required 12 points of comparison matching to have a positive identification.|$|E
