5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The main {{radiographic}} {{features of}} generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several {{methods such as}} height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> the number of vertebrae involved.

25|$|Netchain {{analysis}} is a theoretical concept integrating {{supply chain management}} and network analysis which was introduced by Lazzarini, Chaddad and Cook in 2001. While supply chain analysis focuses on vertical and network analysis on horizontal inderdependencies across companies, netchain analysis incorporates both type of interdependencies into one concept. Netchain analysis emphasizes value creation and coordination mechanism sources corresponding to different kind of interdependencies. In practice, netchain {{analysis is}} often used in a more general way referring to the perspective <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> chain and network characteristics as well. However, it differs in the focus and in the tools used from network science.|$|E
25|$|At UMass Amherst, only freshmen are {{required}} to live on campus. Housing {{is open to all}} full-time undergraduate students, regardless of year. Upper-class students who have continuously lived on campus during their first and sophomore years are guaranteed housing as long as they choose to live on campus. If, however, a student is admitted after their sophomore year, or moves off campus, and wants to move back onto campus, they are not guaranteed housing, but instead must go through a housing lottery, since demand outstrips supply. Housing assignments are accomplished by a complex process <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> building seniority as well as class year; those choosing to move from their building are subject to a lottery system. There are approximately 12,000 students living on campus.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Court of Colombia {{has issued}} {{statements}} that protect {{the right of}} homosexuals and bisexuals to express themselves in public, {{including the right to}} express affection or love for their partners. In 1994, the Court disapproved the National Council of Television's refusing to show a commercial which featured a same-sex couple. This statement was followed by others as the T-268 of 2000, where the Court disapproved of the mayor of Neiva for preventing a gay parade; the T-301 of 2004, which ordered the Santa Marta police to stop harassing homosexuals who visited the boardwalk of the city; the T-314 of 2011, which analyzed the Tequendama Hotel's refusal to allow access to some homosexuals to two events that were held in its facilities.

25|$|The {{modalities}} {{of financing}} {{water and sanitation}} infrastructure differ substantially between countries. Some countries that have reached higher levels of cost recovery, such as Chile and some utilities in Brazil and Mexico, rely on commercial credit financing. However, {{the vast majority of}} utilities relies on transfers from national governments. These can take various forms: In Colombia municipalities are legally entitled to receive transfers calculated through a formula based on their costs and poverty levels; in Mexico municipalities can apply for matching federal grants provided they fulfill certain conditions that vary by program; in Ecuador municipalities receive transfers based on a formula <b>that</b> <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> their choice of management model and improvements in cost recovery; and in other countries utilities simply receive transfers that can vary from one year to the other without any conditions. The level of transfers from national governments is highly variable and often far from sufficient to increase coverage and improve service quality. Some countries pass loans from international financial institutions on to utilities in the form of credits. However, these international loans only account for a relatively small share of water and sanitation financing in Latin America.|$|E
