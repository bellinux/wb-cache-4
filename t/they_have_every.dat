So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> right {{to feel that way}} as well.|$|E
500|$|In his After Action Report to Admiral Lee of , Lieutenant Commander Flusser {{described}} his losses as heavy and opined {{that it was}} [...] "folly to fight these people on the banks, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> advantage", {{and that he could}} not be of any further service to the Army forces. [...] In the aftermath of the failed mission, both Navy and Army flag officers implied that the cause was attempting to cooperate with the respective sister service. Admiral Lee wrote to Naval Secretary Gideon Welles that [...] "where the situation does not allow [...] gunboats to take care of themselves, they can not assist the army." [...] Further, General Peck wrote to General Dix saying, [...] "there is great uncertainty in operations with gunboats." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Tatchell's {{personal}} website he states, [...] "My Guardian letter cited {{examples of}} youths in Papuan tribes {{and some of}} my friends who, when they were under 16, had sex with adults (over 18s), but who do not feel they were harmed. I was not endorsing their viewpoint but merely stating that they had a different perspective from the mainstream opinion about inter-generational sex. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> right for their perspective to be heard." [...] He also debunks various claims that his critics (such as the British National Party) made against him, such as his contributions to the Betrayal of Youth (BOY) book, published by Warren Middleton of the Paedophile Information Exchange, stating that: ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{has been}} criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the Ice and Fire series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, A Feast for Crows (2005), and the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons (2011). The {{previous}} year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have {{always been part of}} his working process. Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, [...] "George R. R. Martin is not your bitch." [...] Gaiman later went on to state that writers are not machines and that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> right to work on other projects if they want to.|$|E
2500|$|In the Goryeo period jade green celadon ware {{became more}} popular. In the 12th century {{sophisticated}} methods of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in different colours. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn McCune states, [...] "During the twelfth century, {{the production of}} ceramic ware reached its highest refinement. Several new varieties appeared simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must be considered a Korean invention." [...] Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese had produced inlaid celadon, which was unique to Goryeo wares. William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England, who after World War II wrote, [...] "The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, {{they are the most}} gracious and unaffected pottery ever made. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> virtue that pottery can have. This Corean pottery, in fact, reached heights hardly attained even by the Chinese." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Allen Rosenshine, a {{copywriter}} {{who went}} on to lead BBDO, called the show a [...] "total fabrication", saying that [...] "if anybody talked to women the way these goons do, they’d have been out on their ass". George Lois, who worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach for a year, before starting his own ad agency in 1960, said [...] "Mad Men is nothing more than the fulfilment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters... is glamorous and vintage....nlike the TV 'Mad Men,' we worked full, exhausting, joyous days: pitching new business, creating ideas, [...] "comping" [...] them up, storyboarding them, selling them, photographing them, and directing commercials. And our only 'extracurricular activity' was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams!" [...] Andrew Cracknell, author of The Real Mad Men: The Renegades of Madison Avenue and the Golden Age of Advertising, also thought the show lacked authenticity, stating, [...] "One thing of which they all are all equally contemptuous", in regards to the industry's elite, [...] "is the output of Sterling Cooper. But then <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>every</b> right. None of them would ever have wanted to work for Draper and none of his departments would have got a job at any of their agencies. Particularly Draper himself. Too phony." ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{the reader}} {{may not feel}} in these papers that inner {{solidarity}} which the writer is conscious of; {{and it is in}} this doubt that the writer wishes to offer a word of explanation.
