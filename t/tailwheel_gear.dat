2500|$|Jet {{aircraft}} generally cannot use conventional landing gear, as this orients {{the engines}} {{at a high}} angle, causing their jet blast to bounce {{off the ground and}} back into the air, preventing the elevators from functioning properly. This problem occurred with the third, or [...] "V3" [...] prototype of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. After the first four prototype Me 262 V-series airframes were built with retracting <b>tailwheel</b> <b>gear,</b> the fifth prototype was fitted with fixed tricycle landing gear for trials, with the sixth prototype onwards getting fully retracting tricycle gear. A number of other experimental and prototype jet aircraft had conventional landing gear, including the first successful jet, the Heinkel He 178, and a single Vickers VC.1 Viking, which was modified with Rolls Royce Nene engines to become the world's first jet airliner.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the cabin, under the wing, is {{accessed}} via top hinged doors on both sides. [...] There is a separate, port side door for baggage. The flat {{sides of the}} fuselage taper to the tail. [...] Several undercarriage configurations are available; for land based operations the Tundra builder can choose between tricycle and <b>tailwheel</b> <b>gear.</b> Both use spring cantilever main legs, with large, low pressure tires for work off soft ground; these legs are positioned at the attachment point of the wing struts for the conventional arrangement and further aft for the tricycle gear. Floats can also be fitted, with their main attachment {{at the base of}} the struts and with secondary float struts further aft. [...] Amphibious floats (Montana 2800) may be used. [...] The Tundra may also be equipped with skis. [...] Takeoff roll distances with wheels, skis, and floats are respectively 125 m, 200 m, and 400 m (400ft, 650ft, and 1300ft).|$|E
5000|$|In 1947 SNCASO built two similar light {{aircraft}} both carrying the name Deauville. The first, the S.O.7050 which flew on 11 June had a tricycle undercarriage. [...] The second, the S.O.7055 flew on 1 July with a tailwheel undercarriage. The first {{and possibly the}} second machine was powered by a [...] Mathis 4GO flat-four engine, though the S.O.7055 had a [...] Minié 4Dc-32 flat-four at some point. It was later modified into the SO.7056. In 1948 both airframes were re-engined with [...] Walter Minor 4-III engines and a third seat was added behind the two front side-by-side seats to produce the S.O.7060 Deauville. The undercarriage of the S.O.7050 was modified {{to be like that}} of the SO.7056, so both S.O.7060s had <b>tailwheel</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
