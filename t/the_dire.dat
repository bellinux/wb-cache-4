5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. <b>The</b> <b>dire</b> wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf diet. This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Pleistocene, {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) {{had the same}} shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. <b>The</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was heavier than the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and {{it is assumed that}} they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. <b>The</b> <b>dire</b> wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E

5|$|Specimens {{that have}} been {{identified}} by morphology as Beringian wolves (C.lupus) and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP {{have been found in}} the Natural Trap Cave {{at the base of the}} Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been a division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°Nlatitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats.

Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>dire</b> wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E

They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit.

5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed.
