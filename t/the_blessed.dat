50|$|Contrary to {{the usual}} pattern of making a <b>blessing</b> before <b>the</b> commandment, <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> for {{relieving}} one's bodily needs and <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> for ritually rinsing the hands are both recited afterwards. In the former case, it is forbidden to recite any blessing while one feels one's need, and so <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> is postponed. In the latter case, one may also not recite <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> beforehand since clean hands are a prerequisite for reciting <b>the</b> <b>blessing.</b> Even if one is certain that one's hands are clean (for example, at the Rabbinically-instituted rinsing before breaking bread), one still recites <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> afterwards to avoid confusion.|$|R
2500|$|According to Sephardi custom, <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> is {{said while}} holding only the lulav and the etrog {{is picked up}} once <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> is completed. [...] According to Ashkenazi custom, before <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> is said, <b>the</b> etrog is turned upside-down, {{opposite}} {{the direction in which}} it grows. The reason for these two customs is that <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> must precede <b>the</b> performance of the mitzvah. Should all the species be held in the direction in which they grew, the mitzvah would be fulfilled before <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> is recited.|$|R

5|$|Béla had {{originally}} planned {{to give his}} youngest daughter, Margaret, in marriage to King Ottokar.

With the assistance of her Dominican confessor, she took her final religious vows which prevented her marriage. Infuriated by this act, the King, who had up to that time supported the Dominicans, favored the Franciscans in the subsequent years. He even became a Franciscan tertiary, according to the Greater Legend of his saintly sister, Elisabeth.|$|E

5000|$|Under kashrut, {{the dietary}} rules of Jewish law or (Halacha), some {{orthodox}} rabbis find {{significance to the}} order in which one eats a Krembo. <b>The</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> biscuit is boreh miney mezonot, whereas <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> cream and chocolate is shehakol nihiyya bidvaro. According to halacha, when eating a dish of mixed components, one need pronounce only <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> main components, thus for a chocolate croissant one would say <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> dough, and skip <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> chocolate. But {{in the case of the}} Krembo, there is no consensus as to which is the [...] "main" [...] component: the biscuit, or the cream and chocolate.
