50|$|<b>Turosteride</b> (FCE-26,073) is a {{selective}} inhibitor of the enzyme 5α-reductase which was {{under investigation by}} GlaxoSmithKline {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but was never marketed. Similarly to finasteride, <b>turosteride</b> is selective for the type II isoform of 5α-redcutase, with about 15-fold selectivity for it over type I isoform of the enzyme. In animal studies it has been shown to inhibit prostate size and retard tumor growth. It may also be useful for the treatment of acne and hair loss.|$|E
50|$|Epristeride (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN) (brand names Aipuliete, Chuanliu; former {{developmental}} code names ONO-9302, SKF-105,657) is a steroidal 5α-reductase inhibitor {{that has}} been marketed in China since 2000 {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is a selective, transition-state, non-competitive or uncompetitive, irreversible inhibitor of 5α-reductase, and is specific to the type II isoform of the enzyme similarly to finasteride and <b>turosteride.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inhibition of {{the enzyme}} can be {{classified}} into two categories: steroidal and nonsteroidal. The steroidal class has more inhibitors with examples including finasteride (MK-906), dutasteride (GG745), 4-MA, <b>turosteride,</b> MK-386, MK-434, and MK-963. Several have pursued synthesis of nonsteroidals to inhibit 5α-reductase due to the undesired side effects of steroidals. The most potent and selective inhibitors of 5α-R1 are found in this class, and include benzoquinolones, nonsteroidal aryl acids, butanoid acid derivatives, and more recognizably, polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially gamma-linolenic acid), zinc, and green tea.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the independent {{expression of the}} type 1 and 2 isoforms of human 5 alpha-reductase in the baculovirus-directed insect cell expression system and the selectivity of their inhibition. The catalytic properties and kinetic parameters of the recombinant isozymes were consistent with published data. The type 1 isoform displayed a neutral (range 6 - 8) pH optimum and the type 2 isoform an acidic (5 - 6) pH optimum. The type 2 isoform had higher affinity for testosterone than did the type 1 isoform (Km = 0. 5 and 2. 9 microM, respectively). Finasteride and <b>turosteride</b> were selective inhibitors of the type 2 isoform (Ki (type 2) = 7. 3 and 21. 7 nM compared to Ki (type 1) = 108 and 330 nM, respectively). 4 -MA and the lipido-sterol extract of Serenoa repens (LSESr) markedly inhibited both isozymes (Ki (type 1) = 8. 4 nM and 7. 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; Ki (type 2) = 7. 4 nM and 4. 9 micrograms/ml, respectively). The three azasteroids were competitive inhibitors vs substrate, whereas LSESr displayed non-competitive inhibition of the type 1 isozyme and uncompetitive inhibition of the type 2 isozyme. These observations suggest that the lipid component of LSESr might be responsible for its inhibitory effect by modulating the membrane environment of 5 alpha-reductase. Partially purified recombinant 5 alpha-reductase type 1 activity was preserved {{by the presence of}} lipids indicating that lipids can exert either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on human 5 alpha-reductase...|$|E
