5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. <b>The</b> <b>flashlight</b> can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Silent Hill 3 resembles closely {{that of its}} two predecessors, {{the three}} main {{gameplay}} elements being combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Combat, as well as exploration, takes place in third-person view, with the player able to equip weapons found throughout the game. Heather may also block and perform side-step maneuvers to avoid enemies. As series staples, <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> and radio return, the latter of which crackles when monsters are within close proximity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> and cell phone.|$|E

5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

25|$|Ridley {{corrected}} {{a problem}} with over-sensitive controls on the F-86E Sabre, which was still unsolved after several test flights. Waiting until night had fallen, Ridley led a team of engineers into a darkened hangar.

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} wet cells, Gassner's {{dry cell}} was more solid, {{did not require}} maintenance, did not spill, and {{could be used in}} any orientation. It provided a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the National Carbon Company in 1896. The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled cardboard, an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable electrical devices practical, and led directly to the invention of <b>the</b> <b>flashlight.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} whether ultrasonography (US) -guided vascular access {{can be learned}} and performed faster with <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> than with conventional US and to demonstrate sonic flashlight-guided vascular access in a cadaver. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and oral and written informed consent were obtained. <b>The</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> replaces <b>the</b> standard US monitor with a real-time US image that appears to float beneath the skin and is displayed where it is scanned. In studies 1 and 2, participants performed sonic flashlight-guided needle insertion tasks in vascular phantoms. In study 1, 16 participants (nine women, seven men) with no US experience performed 60 simulated vascular access trials with sonic flashlight or conventional US guidance. With analysis of variance (ANOVA) and power-curve fitting, improvement with practice rate and mean differences between techniques and tasks were examined. In study 2, 14 female nurses (mean age, 50. 1 years) proficient with conventional US performed simulated vascular access trials on three tasks with <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> and conventional US. With random assignment, half the participants used <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> first and half used conventional US first. Mean performance with each technique and that with each task were compared by using ANOVA. In study 3, feasibility of sonic flashlight guidance for access to internal jugular and basilic veins was demonstrated in a cadaver. RESULTS: For study 1, learning rates (ie, decrease in access time over trials) did not differ for vascular access with sonic flashlight and conventional US. Overall, participants achieved faster vascular access times with sonic flashlight guidance (P 3 ̆c. 007). In study 2, participants performed procedures faster overall with <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> (P 3 ̆c. 02) and found <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> easier to use. In study 3, sonic flashlight-guided vascular access was gained in the cadaver. CONCLUSION: Learning and performance of vascular access were significantly faster with <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> than with conventional US, and vascular access could be gained in a cadaver; <b>the</b> sonic <b>flashlight</b> is ready for clinical trials...|$|R
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau {{drove into the}} Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9mm Luger. The killer directed <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer {{walked away from the}} car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E
25|$|Ubisoft {{executive}} Tony Key {{said that}} although the game was designed for the Wii U, the company might bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right (who had developed Mass Effect 3 Wii U version), it was released on August 18, 2015. The game {{is similar to the}} original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second-screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. The shovel has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second (a nailed bat) inflicts more damage, has a higher critical-hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU flashlight can switch to a wider, further-reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. <b>The</b> <b>flashlight</b> must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single-player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E
500|$|The lights, and, by extension, <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> {{and flash}} beacon, {{are found in}} all main games, {{excluding}} the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a control pad, and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] <b>The</b> <b>flashlight</b> in the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off. The flash beacon was introduced in Sister Location, and is used to quickly gather bearings in the pitch black room seen on the third and fifth nights.|$|E

The name [...] "Arc" [...] came from intense white light some LEDs produce, looking similar {{to the color of}} an electric arc welder.|$|R
500|$|Konami's Silent Hill, {{released}} in 1999, drew heavily from Resident Evil while using realtime 3D environments {{in contrast to}} Resident Evils pre-rendered graphics. Silent Hill in particular was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. The game also featured stealth elements, making use of the fog to dodge enemies or turning off <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> to avoid detection. The original Silent Hill {{is considered one of}} the scariest games of all time, and the strong narrative from Silent Hill 2 in 2001 has made the Silent Hill series one of the most influential in the genre. According to IGN, the [...] "golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo" [...] with the release of Silent Hill.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{levels are}} fairly linear {{in nature and}} {{incorporate}} several horror elements, {{the most prominent of}} which is darkness. This design choice is not only intended to foster feelings of apprehension and fear within the player, but also to create a more threatening game environment in which the player is less likely to see attacking enemies. This aspect is further enhanced {{by the fact that the}} player must choose between holding a weapon and holding <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> (until the BFG editions released in 2012 made the [...] "duct tape mod" [...] a standard feature), forcing the player to choose between being able to see and having a readied weapon upon entering a room, which consequently leads to a more deliberate pace for the player. In addition, the levels are regularly strewn with corpses, dismembered body parts and blood, sometimes used in conjunction with the game's lighting to disorient the player.|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{shared the}} same {{atmosphere}} of psychological horror as the first Silent Hill game. As the developers already had a rough sense of the game's environment, they focused on its plot first, {{in contrast to the}} process used with the first game. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed the developers to create improved fog and shadow special effects. For example, as a monster approaches the player character, its shadow cast on the wall by <b>the</b> <b>flashlight</b> grows. When dealing with the game's camera angles, the team struggled with a balance between those that stayed true to the creative vision and those that did not hamper gameplay. Psychological elements, such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter and symbolic holes, were incorporated into the game. The team wanted Silent Hill 2s protagonist to [...] "reflect [...] evil," [...] against which the protagonist of the first game battles.|$|E
