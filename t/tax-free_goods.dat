50|$|As {{with other}} sales taxes, visiting {{residents}} of non-participating states who purchase <b>tax-free</b> <b>goods</b> (holiday or not) {{may still have}} to pay use tax on the goods they take home.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{base and}} post exchanges (called BX in the Air Force, PX in the Army) provide <b>tax-free</b> <b>goods</b> - {{including}} name brands such as Michael Kors, Coach, and Ralph Lauren - to authorized shoppers. In addition, some Exchanges host concession malls {{with a variety}} of vendors and storefronts.|$|E
50|$|Nahr al-Bared {{was also}} home to the largest market in {{northern}} Lebanon; many Lebanese relied on the <b>tax-free</b> <b>goods</b> and black market prices to keep {{the cost of living}} down in a country with current inflation at 5.6%. The demise of Nahr al-Bared was a devastating blow to the local economy.http://www.pulitzercenter.org/openitem.cfm?id=835 The failure of the international community, and Arab states in particular, to fund an emergency humanitarian appeal for Nahr al-Bared means life for refugees living there is set to get harder.|$|E
50|$|With {{the loss}} of {{sovereign}} access to the Pacific ocean in mind the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship granted Bolivia the right to <b>tax-free</b> transport of <b>goods,</b> and duty-free access to northern Chilean ports. It also obliged the Chilean government to build two rail-lines linking La Paz to Antofagasta and Arica.|$|R
5000|$|Ellroy {{dropped out}} of school and joined the US Army for a short while. During his teens and 20s, he drank heavily and abused Benzedrex inhalers. He was engaged in minor crimes (especially shoplifting, house-breaking, and burglary) and was often homeless. After serving some time in jail and {{suffering}} from pneumonia, during which he developed an abscess on his lung [...] "the size of a large man's fist," [...] Ellroy stopped drinking and began working as a golf caddy while pursuing writing. He later said, [...] "Caddying was <b>good</b> <b>tax-free</b> cash and allowed me to get home by 2 p.m. and write books.... I caddied right up to the sale of my fifth book." ...|$|R
500|$|In the inter-war period, {{officers}} led a [...] "country club existence". They {{had a high}} social standing, {{equivalent to}} that of an upper-middle-class professional. They normally worked a 30-hour week, which gave them {{plenty of time to}} spend with their families, and for sports. They and their families had access to free medical and dental care. They had free life insurance, and an adequate salary, which could be stretched because Army commissaries and post exchanges sold many everyday <b>goods</b> <b>tax-free.</b> [...] They invariably lived on-base in good housing, and in tight-knit and supportive communities. When posted overseas, they took their families with them. A secure and steady job was highly prized during the Great Depression years from 1929 to 1939, and resignations were rare.|$|R
50|$|Viking Line {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Cinderella from the Helsinki-Tallinn route {{after the end}} of the 2003 summer seasons, due to increased competition from Tallink's newer MS Romantika and the fact tax-free sales on the route would end in 2004 when Estonia joined the EU. Cinderella was extensively rebuilt in Naantali, and emerged as the all-white Swedish-flagged Viking Cinderella for the Stockholm-Mariehamn 22-hour cruise market. The name change was dictated by necessity as a ship called Cinderella already existed in the Swedish ship registry. In 2003 the Viking Cinderella was declared the most environmentally friendly ship of her size in the world by the Swedish maritime authorities. From 2004 onwards Viking Cinderella made cruises to Riga (via Mariehamn in order to sell <b>tax-free</b> <b>goods)</b> during the summer season in addition to the 22-hour cruises. Viking Cinderella is currently the ship used in Sweden's Kanal 5 docusoap FÃ¤rjan.|$|E
5000|$|International {{duty free}} {{shopping}} may be termed [...] "tax-free shopping". In <b>tax-free</b> shopping, the <b>goods</b> are permanently taken outside the jurisdiction, thus paying taxes is not necessary. Tax-free shopping {{is also found}} in ships, airplanes and other vessels traveling between countries (or tax areas). Tax-free shopping is usually available in dedicated duty-free shops. However, any transaction may be duty-free, given that the goods are presented to the customs when exiting the country. In such a scenario, a sum equivalent to the tax is paid, but reimbursed on exit. More common in Europe, tax-free is less frequent in the United States, with the exception of Louisiana. However, current European Union rules prohibit most intra-EU tax-free trade, with the exception of certain special territories outside the tax area.|$|R
