5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended <b>to</b> <b>require</b> fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order <b>to</b> <b>require</b> pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury <b>to</b> <b>require</b> an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected.

5|$|Perl 5.004 was {{released}} on May 15, 1997, and included among other things the UNIVERSAL package, giving Perl a base object to which all classes were automatically derived and the ability <b>to</b> <b>require</b> versions of modules. Another significant development was {{the inclusion of the}} CGI.pm module, which contributed to Perl's popularity as a CGI scripting language.|$|E

Some varieties derived from skim mozzarella variants were designed not <b>to</b> <b>require</b> aging {{or the use of}} fermentation starter. Others can be produced through the direct acidification of milk, which may be used in place of bacterial fermentation.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again <b>to</b> <b>require</b> the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough <b>to</b> <b>require</b> medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stormy}} debate {{in which the}} {{survival}} of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was <b>to</b> <b>require</b> a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough <b>to</b> <b>require</b> two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
30|$|In {{spite of}} these problems, many {{researchers}} have estimated the ORU-model {{and the results are}} remarkably consistent both over time and space (see Hartog 2000): (1) The returns to actual years of schooling are lower than the returns <b>to</b> <b>required</b> years of schooling; (2) The returns to overeducation are positive, but smaller than the returns <b>to</b> <b>required</b> education, i.e. β 3 [*]>[*] 0 but β 3 [*]<[*]β 2. This means that overeducated workers earn more than correctly matched workers in the same types of jobs but less than correctly matched workers with the same years of schooling; (3) The returns to under-education are negative, but the estimate is smaller than the estimate for the returns <b>to</b> <b>required</b> education, i.e. β 1 [*]<[*] 0 but | β 1 |[*]<[*]β 2.|$|R
