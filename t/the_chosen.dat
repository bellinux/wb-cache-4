50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chooser</b> is an {{application}} program for Macintosh systems using the classic Mac OS. <b>The</b> <b>Chooser</b> {{started out as}} a desk accessory and became a standalone application program as of System 7. <b>The</b> <b>Chooser</b> allowed users to connect to AppleShare file servers (via AppleTalk or TCP/IP), enable or disable the network access, and select which printer to use.|$|R
5000|$|This variant is {{particularly}} {{useful as a}} pastime for long trips, since a single round can sometimes last over an hour. As in the standard version, <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> picks a famous person or character and provides an initial (for example, if <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> picked Sandro Botticelli, {{he or she would}} provide the letter [...] "B"). The guesser must then think of a trivia question which can be answered by a word beginning with that letter, so in our example the guesser might ask, [...] "What is the most populous country in South America?", the answer being [...] "Brazil." [...] The answer to the question must be something <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> could reasonably know, not something personal to the guesser (e.g. [...] "What was the name of my invisible friend when I was five?") or anything otherwise impossible to guess. If <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> answers correctly, <b>the</b> guesser must think of another question. If <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> is stumped and cannot answer, the guesser may ask a single yes-or-no question (as in direct mode of the standard version) about the person or character. Once <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> answers <b>the</b> question, the guesser must stump <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> again before asking another direct question. Generally, guessing the identity of the person or character counts as a direct question and can only be done after <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> is stumped; however, in the interest of shortening the game, players sometimes will guess the person without having first stumped <b>the</b> <b>chooser.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{specific}} bargaining game is studied, {{motivated by}} the speech-making, bill-proposing, and bill-vetoing observed in legislative processes. The game has two players, a chooser and a proposer, with the preferences of <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> not known to <b>the</b> proposer. <b>The</b> <b>chooser</b> starts <b>the</b> game by talking. Then the proposer proposes an outcome, which <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> accepts or vetos. Only two kinds of perfect equilibria exist. In the more interesting kind, <b>the</b> <b>chooser</b> tells <b>the</b> proposer which of two sets contains his type. Two proposals are possibly elicited, a compromise proposal and the proposer's favorite proposal. Ironically, only the compromise proposal is ever vetoed.

5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond statistic with <b>the</b> <b>chosen</b> character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{implementing}} Rule 5 begins with picking <b>the</b> best <b>chooser.</b> Usually, <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> is <b>the</b> smallest number party. <b>The</b> best <b>chooser</b> will then have to “compare its own opportunity cost to the opportunity cost (figured by the judge) of the other party or parties.” The second step is {{the implementation of the}} double-reverse twist proposed by Krier and Schwab. First, the judge estimates the other party’s social costs (damages caused by <b>the</b> best <b>chooser).</b> [...] Then, <b>the</b> judge enters an order requiring <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> to decide whether to continue causing damage to the other party without receiving any compensation or stop causing damage and receive compensation. [...] Therefore, if <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> decides to stop causing harm to the other party, then the other party will have to pay <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> damages calculated by the judge. Should <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> decide to stay, then <b>the</b> best <b>chooser</b> continues to cause harm and receives no payment.|$|R
