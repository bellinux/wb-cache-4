5|$|A new <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> was fitted, {{with the}} main gear units {{retracting}} into the engine nacelles.|$|E
5|$|Yak-15U (Yakovlev Yak-15U-RD10): (U - uloochshenny - improved) Improved Yak-15 with <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> {{and drop}} tanks, became the {{prototype}} of the Yak-17 proper.|$|E
5|$|The Il-32 was an aluminum-bodied, high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fixed <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> whose fuselage was {{square in}} cross-section to fit as much cargo as possible. The two-spar wings had a moderate aspect ratio. It {{was regarded as}} expendable and was built very simply to facilitate large-scale manufacture. The nose and tail sections swung up to 95° to starboard to facilitate loading.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first and}} only SE-2300 had a fixed {{conventional}} undercarriage with oleo-pneumatic springing, faired main legs and wheels and a swivelling tailwheel. [...] The two SE-2310s had <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> the first unfaired but the second with faired legs and spats.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst the Valkyrie and the Ion {{share the}} share twin boom, single pusher engine, mid-wing layout, have <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages</b> and seat two in tandem, they differ significantly. [...] In {{particular}} the Valkyrie's strongly swept and tapered fins, {{combined with a}} trailing low set horizontal tail, which extended beyond the booms, have been replaced with swept, parallel chord fins with a constant chord tailplane linking their upper tips. [...] Unlike the Valkyrie, the Ion {{does not have a}} canard.|$|R
50|$|Aligned {{approximately}} east-west off {{the northern}} end of the wartime north-south runway (in the adjacent suburb of Toll), the Bore Sight Range includes an aircraft hardstand {{in the form of a}} raised concrete platform approximately 15 metres square. A steel tie down shackle is set into the concrete surface. An adjustable metal plate, which can be raised or lowered, is set at the front of the raised hardstand to carry the nose wheel of aircraft fitted with <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages.</b> A cleared range extends east about 360 metres from the hardstand to the original earth butt, in front of which a recent display target is set.|$|R
5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{services}} sought different {{characteristics in}} their aircraft – the RAF desired a single-seat fighter with secondary intercept capability, while the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) sought a two-seat interceptor capable of secondary low-level strike capability. Accordingly, HSA's submission involved {{the development of}} two distinct variants of the same P.1154 aircraft, each aimed towards a particular service and its stated requirements. Although financially and politically committed to a joint requirement with the Royal Navy, the RAF's single-seat design took precedence over the two-seat version of the Royal Navy. However, RAF P.1154s would have to accommodate the Navy's large airborne intercept (AI) radar. When HSA submitted the design on 8August, the Royal Navy criticised the proposal, which had a tandem undercarriage layout incompatible with catapult operations; consequently, a <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> design was investigated and accepted as practical. The aircraft would have been armed with the Red Top missile.|$|E
50|$|The wing has {{constant}} chord with slightly blunted tips, with flaps filling the trailing edge inboard of the ailerons. The main wing struts are V-shaped {{and attached to}} the lower fuselage, assisted by some secondary bracing. Fin and rudder are swept, with a long dorsal fillet. The tailplane is mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and has a swept leading edge. A trim tab on the starboard elevator is flight adjustable only on the Condor Plus. Both types normally have fixed <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> with mainwheels on cantilever legs. Wheel and leg fairings are an option. A fixed conventional undercarriage with a tailwheel is also available.|$|R
50|$|For {{research}} into <b>Tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages</b> D.W.L. converted the prototype RWD 9 to the RWD 20 fitting a 130 hp Walter Major engine, steerable noseleg, moving the main undercarriage legs rearwards, and removing the rear seats door and windows which were faired over with plywood. Extensive testing {{was carried out}} with take-offs, landings and taxiing on different surfaces including unprepared fields as well as ploughed land. Conversion was completed in 1938 and the flight trials proved the stability and manoeuvrability of the tri-cycle undercarriage during extensive taxiing trials, (landings and take-offs were carried out with the nosewheel steering locked). The fate of the RWD 20 is unknown {{but it did not}} survive WWII.|$|R
50|$|Tests {{with the}} Hurel-Dubois HD.10 {{research}} aircraft had validated Hurel's {{ideas about the}} practicality of such wings, and the French government agreed to sponsor the construction of two prototypes of a medium-range airliner utilising this same principle. These aircraft, the HD.31 and HD.32 were conventional designs in all respects other than their unorthodox wings, and differed from one another only in their powerplants, although both were later converted {{to use the same}} engines. The twin-tails originally fitted were also later replaced by a large single tail fin assisted by smaller auxiliary fins. With their new engines and tails, they were redesignated HD.321.01 and HD.321.02. Apart from the HD.34 survey aircraft, all had fixed, faired <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Terrier {{was not an}} {{economic}} success for the manufacturer as {{it was found that}} more man-hours were spent on rebuilding each aircraft after its military use than were spent in building the new aircraft for the Army. It was also out-dated as, by 1961, most competing manufacturers were introducing new designs which were all-metal, with <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages</b> and powered by more modern engines such as Lycoming or Continental (e.g. the Cessna 150 and the Piper Cherokee). However the Terrier has found many adherents among vintage light aircraft owner pilots. Examples of the type were purchased by owners in the United Kingdom, Eire, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden. 23 Terriers were registered in the UK in 2013.|$|R
50|$|During mid-February 1943 the Department of Public Works {{received}} a requisition from the US Army {{for construction of}} a gun firing range, or bore sight range, platform at Charters Towers airfield to test the accuracy of aircraft fixed armament. The work order was lodged with the superintending engineer, Department of Interior, Townsville. The concrete gun firing platform was designed with an adjustable metal plate set {{in front of the}} concrete block to take the nose wheel of aircraft with <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> such as the B-25. A steel gantry frame with a sling was positioned on the platform to lift the tail of fighter aircraft with tail wheels such as the P-40. The bore sight range extended about 360 metres to an earth mound, or butt, in front of which a target was set.|$|R
50|$|The CAJO 59 was {{powered by}} two 65 hp (49 kW) Walter Mikron III {{inverted}} inline engines. Two fixed floats, mounted well outboard on single struts, stabilised flights off water. It had a manually retractable <b>tricycle</b> wheeled <b>undercarriage,</b> with main legs {{mounted on the}} fuselage and retracting into it above the waterline.|$|R
25|$|The Percival Merganser was a light, civil {{transport}} {{of the late}} 1940s. It was a twin-engine, high-wing monoplane of all-metal, stressed skin construction with retractable <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|E

25|$|The P-39 was an all-metal, low-wing, {{single-engine}} fighter, with a <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and an Allison V-1710 liquid-cooled V-12 {{engine mounted}} in the central fuselage, directly behind the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-metal construction using pre-formed multi-curvature {{panels and}} is supplied as a kit to homebuilders. The Venture has a complex <b>tricycle</b> retractable <b>undercarriage,</b> but the Spirit version has a fixed spatted main landing gear, the {{nose landing gear}} remaining retractable. The engine is a Continental IO-550-G, designed specifically for the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The Ion Aircraft Ion is a {{development}} of the DreamWings Valkyrie, a twin boom, pusher configuration ultralight aircraft which flew {{for the first time}} in 1999. The Valkyrie generated considerable interest and many potential customers, but DreamWings became bankrupt in 2001. The project was later restarted by a customer group under the name of Ion Aircraft and the part-built prototype of the Ion was displayed at Oshkosh in July 2005, though the first [...] "hops" [...] were not made until July 2007. Whilst the Valkyrie and the Ion share the share twin boom, single pusher engine, mid-wing layout, have <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriages</b> and seat two in tandem, they differ significantly. In particular the Valkyrie's strongly swept and tapered fins, combined with a trailing low set horizontal tail, which extended beyond the booms, have been replaced with swept, parallel chord fins with a constant chord tailplane linking their upper tips. Unlike the Valkyrie, the Ion does not have a canard.|$|R
25|$|The MiG-21 uses a <b>tricycle</b> type <b>undercarriage.</b> On most {{variants}} {{the main}} landing gear uses tires that are 800mm in diameter and 200mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660x200mm. The wheels of the {{main landing gear}} retract into the fuselage after rotating 87° and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar.|$|R
25|$|Enhanced Lynx variant with Westland 30 {{tail boom}} and rotor, Gem 60 engines, new wheeled <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and MIL-STD-1553 databus. Only one {{prototype}} built (serial/registration ZE477 / G-17-24) in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The Quail is an {{all-metal}} cantilever high-wing monoplane with {{an enclosed}} cabin and <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage.</b> The aircraft uses simple flat-sided construction with pop-rivet assembly. The wing design is unmodified from the Aerosport Rail homebuilt. The prototype was powered with a Rockwell L680R engine.|$|E
25|$|Current {{pre-production}} aircraft are powered by 580kW (778hp) Walter M601F turboprop engines, later production models will have 596kW (800hp) General Electric H80 turboprops a {{development of the}} M601. The Rysachok has a <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> with inward retracting single mainwheels and a forward retracting twin nosewheel.|$|E
50|$|The Aviakit Véga is an {{ultralight}} aircraft seating two in side-by-side configuration. It was designed in France {{in the late}} 1990s to be easily constructed by amateurs from kits and was offered {{with a choice of}} three engines and of <b>tricycle</b> or conventional <b>undercarriages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Berger BX-50 was an {{experimental}} helicopter developed by Swiss inventor Hans Berger in 1961. Built largely at home, {{it was a}} single-seat design of conventional configuration with a bubble canopy, a two-blade rotor, and skid undercarriage. The upper portion of the canopy could slide to admit the pilot. After a number of test flights, the rotor was replaced with a semi-rigid three-blade design and the skids with <b>tricycle,</b> wheeled <b>undercarriage.</b> Not long after, it was damaged beyond repair and abandoned. In photographs, the registration number HB-XBC is visible, but this was never actually issued by Swiss authorities.|$|R
50|$|The Comp Air 6 has a fore-and-aft {{fuselage}} splice {{to widen}} and lengthen the cabin {{from the original}} design. It is usually supplied in kit form. The design is configured as a conventional high-wing monoplane and may be built with either <b>tricycle</b> or tailwheel <b>undercarriage</b> and may alternately be equipped with floats as the CA6SF, amphibious as the CA6AF, or with skis.|$|R
25|$|The DF 2000 was {{designed}} to provide a fast, robust, comfortable, low-cost side-by-side two-seat ultralight with a short take-off run. It has a conventional layout not unlike that of, for example, the Cessna 152, with a high wing, swept vertical tail and <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{orders were}} placed on 4 February 1947 for 25 of the {{definitive}} HP 81 Hermes IV, fitted with a <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and powered by 2,100hp (1,570kW) Bristol Hercules 763 engines, for BOAC and two HP Hermes V, powered by the Bristol Theseus turboprop engines.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tricycle</b> <b>undercarriage</b> was fitted, {{with the}} {{nosewheel}} retracting forwards. The single-wheel main legs retracted into coverless fairings in the wings, {{so that the}} sides of the wheels could be seen even when retracted. The wings themselves, unusually, had a different airfoil cross-section on the inner wings than the outer.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the Maule M-4, it is a high-wing, strut-braced {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} configuration, available with tailwheel or optional <b>tricycle</b> wheeled <b>undercarriage</b> and frequently used [...] as a seaplane with twin pontoons. The basic M-7 has a longer cabin than its predecessors the M5 & M6, with two seats in front, a bench seat {{for up to}} three passengers behind them, and (like the M-6) an optional third row of [...] "kiddie seats" [...] at the rear. Extra cabin windows can be fitted if the [...] "kiddie seats" [...] are to be used. The MX-7 uses the same fuselage as the M-6,which is a modified M5 fuselage but the same wing span as the M-5, and incorporates the increased fuel tankage, hoerner style wing tip [...] and five-position flaps designed for the M-7.|$|R
5000|$|The name Chardonneret (Goldfinch) {{was applied}} to the three {{completed}} examples of the first post-war designs from the Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre (SNCAC) company at Bourges. The NC.832, NC.840 and NC.841 trio differed chiefly in their engines and the number of people they could hold. The Chardonnerets were all high-wing, braced cabin monoplanes. The NC.832 was powered by a [...] four cylinder inline inverted air-cooled Régnier 4E.O engine and carried three. It had a tail wheel undercarriage and first flew on 3 November 1946. The other two were both four-seaters. The NC.840 had a [...] Renault 4Pei engine of similar configuration to the Régnier and a <b>tricycle</b> wheel <b>undercarriage.</b> The NC.841 had a [...] Mathis 175H radial engine and a tail wheel undercarriage. Although the aircraft did not sell, the experience was used in the tail wheel landing gear NC.850.|$|R
50|$|The Alon A-4 is a {{prototype}} American light aircraft of the 1960s. Alon INC. of McPherson, Kansas {{was formed by}} two former executives of Beechcraft in 1963 and had initially built an improved version of the ERCO Ercoupe as the Alon A-2. In 1964, Alon started design of an all-new four-seat light aircraft, the Alon Four (or Alon A-4). It was a conventional, singled-engined low-winged monoplane of all-metal construction with a fixed (non retractable) <b>tricycle</b> landing gear <b>undercarriage.</b> Alon produced one prototype, this first flying on February 25, 1966. The aircraft was never put into full production before the company was sold to Mooney aircraft.|$|R
