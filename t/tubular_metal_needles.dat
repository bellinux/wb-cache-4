40|$|The method {{involves}} {{forming a}} coil {{head of a}} loop from a <b>tubular</b> <b>metal</b> semi-finished product (1), and removing the regions of the <b>tubular</b> <b>metal</b> semi-finished product, for forming the conductor loop. The regions of the <b>tubular</b> <b>metal</b> semi-finished product are removed in accordance with a helical profile. The individual portions of the conductor loop are added together by welding, clamping, pressing, gluing and/or by connectors that are electrically conductive to each other to form the electrical coil. Independent claims are included for the following: (1) an electrical coil; (2) an electrical machine or electrical arrangement; and (3) a device for manufacturing electrical coil...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the patients' sensations during and after laserneedle versus <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> acupuncture. STUDY DESIGN: The prospective study was performed at the gynaecological outpatient department of a University Teaching Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. Thirty female patients per group were included in the study and randomized into laserneedle or <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> group. All women visited the acupuncture out patient department because of gynaecological disorders. Age of the patients in the <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> group was 38 years in median (range 18 - 73 years); mean age was 41 +/- 13. 3. Age in the laserneedle group was 36 years in median (range 16 - 60 years) and mean age was 39. 1 +/- 12. 2. Interventions were laserneedle acupuncture and <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> acupuncture. Patients answered a questionnaire before, after the first treatment and prior to the second treatment. The questionnaires asked about the patients' knowledge of the various acupuncture methods and their health condition before treatment, their perception of pain, warmth, tiredness and relaxation during or after application of the needles or during or after the treatment. Statistics were performed by Graph Pad InStat 3 for windows. RESULTS: The common <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> technique was well known by the patients in comparison to the laserneedle method (p< 0. 0001 ***). Laserneedle acupuncture is a method which is painless (p< 0. 0001 ***), energy inducing and relaxing (p= 0. 0257 *) which leads to a warming sensation (p= 0. 0009 ***) during treatment. CONCLUSION: Both methods laserneedle and <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> acupuncture are valuable methods in achieving relaxation and improvement of gynaecological symptoms. Laserneedle acupuncture is painless and easy to apply which is a valuable reason to support this technique in the future...|$|R

40|$|Acupuncture is {{a therapy}} based on sensory {{stimulation}} {{of the human body}} by means of <b>metal</b> <b>needles.</b> The exact underlying mechanisms of acupuncture have not been clarified so far. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an important tool in acupuncture research. Standard acupuncture needles, which are made of ferromagnetic steel, however, are problematic in acupuncture-fMRI studies for several reasons, such as attraction by the scanner's magnetic field, significant image distortions and signal-dropouts, when positioned close to the head or even heating due to absorption of radio frequency (RF). The aim {{of this study was to}} compare two novel types of acupuncture needles with a standard needle for their effect on MRI image quality. The standard needle severely reduced image quality, when located inside the RF coil. The nonferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> may pose a risk due to RF heating, while the plastic needle has a significantly larger diameter. In conclusion, our recommendations are: (1) standard needles should not be used in MRI; (2) Nonferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>needles</b> seem to be the best choice for acupoints outside of the transmitter coil; and (3) only plastic needles are suited for points inside the coil. Laser acupuncture may be a safe alternative, too...|$|R

40|$|The {{utility model}} {{discloses}} an electrospray ionization device directly analyzing solid samples. The device comprises an injector and a <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> {{on the front}} end of the injector, and an injection pump and a pipettor tip connected with the rear end of the injector. High voltage electricity is loaded after the <b>metal</b> <b>needle</b> is inserted into the pipettor tip. The device uses the injection pump to drive the injector to continuously guide solvent into the pipettor tip, the solvent flows through the solid sample in the pipettor tip and extracts the sample. High-voltage electricity is loaded on the <b>metal</b> <b>needle,</b> and is conducted to the tip outlet of the pipettor tip through the solvent, so as to induce output solution to form electrospray ionization. Ions ionized by electrospray are directly led into a mass spectrometer to measure, and a mass spectrum is obtained. The device is simple, economical, durable, and can rapidly and directly perform electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on solid samples. The device can be assembled in most mass spectrometry laboratories and can be applied in electrospray ionization mass spectrometers in various models. 本实用新型公开了一种直接分析固体样品的电喷雾电离装置，包括：注射器及其前端的金属针头，与所述注射器后端连接的注射泵，移液器吸头，所述金属针头插入所述移液器吸头内后加载高压电。本实用新型通过注射泵驱动注射器向移液器吸头内持续导入溶剂，该溶剂流过移液器吸头内的固体样品并对其进行提取，高压电加载在金属针头上并通过溶剂传导到移液器吸头的尖端出口处诱导输出溶液形成电喷雾电离，电喷雾电离的离子被直接导入质谱仪中进行测量，产生质谱图。本实用新型简单、经济、耐用、能对固体样品进行快速直接的电喷雾电离质谱分析，能够在大多数质谱分析实验室中组装并应用于各种型号的电喷雾电离质谱仪。Department of Applied Biology and Chemical TechnologyInventor name used in this publication: 姚钟平Inventor name used in this publication: 王海星Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種直接分析固體樣品的電噴霧電離裝置Chin...|$|R
