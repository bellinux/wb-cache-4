5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E

The soap was attracting 15.74 million viewers in May 1998, as opposed to rival soap Coronation Street's 16 million.|$|E

5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public {{debate over whether}} <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> station to the east or west of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz.

A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>the</b> supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E

Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

The Cape government sought to regain control in 1880 by extending the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, which provided for the disarmament of natives.
