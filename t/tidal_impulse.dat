40|$|Dial {{variations}} of important hydrographic parameters were studied continuously for 7 {{days at a}} 100 m depth station off Cochin. The frequency of observations varied from 1 - 3 hourly intervals. In surface waters, the ranges in temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen values recorded during 10 - 17 April were 30. 64 °- 32. 36 °C, 34. 56 - 34. 68 X lO"' and 4. 06 - 4. 65 ml/ 1 respectively. Tlie STD profiles in the diurnal study revealed clearly the premonsoon warming (30 °- 31 °C) in the upper 0 - 30 m depth zone. In the water column up to 50 m depth, mean salinity values ranged from 34. 6 to 35 X 10 while dissolved oxygen values were above 4 mI/ 1. Time series observations on the production and utilisation of dissolved oxygen revealed wide fluctuation from hour to hour. Vertical gradients in the diurnal study indicated the existence of thermocline around 60 m depth with sharp decline in temperature and dissolved oxygen and increase in salinity below 60 m. The diurnal variation {{on the distribution of}} temperature and dissolved oxygen exhibited significant rhythmic <b>tidal</b> <b>impulse</b> of a semi-diurnal wave pattern which was more prominent in the bottom layer below 60 m...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamical}} properties of interacting galaxies and {{the properties of}} shocked gas produced {{as a result of}} the interaction. We observed 22 galaxy mergers using the SparsePak IFU at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). The goal of the observations was to obtain the Hα velocity maps over the entire luminous parts of the galaxies including the faint tidal tails, and to find extended shocks and outflows. Our sample consists of major and minor galaxy mergers with mass ratios 1 <μ< 8. We fit multiple kinematic components to the Hα and [N II] emission lines, develop an MCMC code to robustly estimate the error of fit parameters, and use the F-test to determine the best number of kinematic components for each fiber. We use [N II]/Hα and velocity dispersion of components to separate star-forming (HII) regions from shocks. We use the kinematics of the Hα emission from HII regions and an automated modeling method to put the first ever constraints on the encounter parameters of one of the observed systems. Besides, we estimate the fraction of shocked Hα emission, f_shocked, and examine the spatial distribution of shocks. We find that close galaxy pairs have, on average, a higher shock fraction than wide pairs, and coalesced mergers have the highest average f_shocked. In addition, galaxy pairs with more equal mass ratio tend to have a higher f_shocked. Combining the dynamical models from the literature and this work, we inspect trends between f_shocked and dynamical encounter parameters. Our findings are generally consistent with shocks being produced either by direct collision of the ISM or by the chain of events provoked by the <b>tidal</b> <b>impulse</b> during the first passage.
