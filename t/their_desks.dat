25|$|During the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, a fourth-grade {{teacher in}} Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 {{children}} from potentially life-threatening ballistic window glass cuts by ordering them to hide under <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> {{when she saw}} the flash. Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's blast wave arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under <b>their</b> <b>desks,</b> suffered a cut. A follow up study {{of the effects of the}} meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.|$|E

25|$|Afternoon {{television}} news bulletins during {{the mid to}} late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while {{sitting on the edge of}} a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.|$|E
25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|Extraverts and introverts have {{a variety}} of {{behavioral}} differences. According to one study, extraverts tend to wear more decorative clothing, whereas introverts prefer practical, comfortable clothes. Extraverts are more likely to prefer more upbeat, conventional, and energetic music than introverts. Personality also influences how people arrange their work areas. In general, extraverts decorate their offices more, keep their doors open, keep extra chairs nearby, {{and are more likely to}} put dishes of candy on <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> These are attempts to invite co-workers and encourage interaction. Introverts, in contrast, decorate less and tend to arrange their workspace to discourage social interaction.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. economy {{continued}} to grow, but {{the effects of}} the Cold War were imminent. Many families built bomb shelters in their yards, and children had learned to “duck and cover” under <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> as an emergency drill to a nuclear blast (U-S-History.com). This state of cold war was fought through Vietnam with America supporting the anti-communist South Vietnam and the Soviet Union supporting the pro-communist North Vietnam (What was the Cold War, 2000). The U.S.’s economy showed a short prosperous growth, which faltered when Lyndon Johnson failed to raise taxes to cover war expenses (Carr and Conte). The war dragged on until 1975 and the economy stagnated. During this time period though, the U.S. had established the Department of Transportation in 1966 and the Federal Highway Administration in 1967 (About Inc.). These agencies were responsible for building our nation’s transportations systems of roads and bridges and provided the funding for engineers like Figg.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the rest}} of the series, the scenes for the first-season episodes were shot on-location in Baltimore. The use of {{hand-held}} cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city, rather than on a sound-stage in Los Angeles or New York City, where most shows are typically shot. Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore [...] "to be a character in the show". The Recreation Pier Building, a Fells Point structure built in 1914 which once housed Baltimore's marine police, was used as the set of the police department station, which was the principal set for the show. The building looked so realistic that Baltimore residents would occasionally wander into it to report actual crimes. Production director Vincent Peranino created the squad room set inside the Recreation Pier Building. While most sets include a few fake walls opposite an open space for the cameras and crew, Peranino designed the entire room {{as if it were a}} real setting, including separate areas for the detectives' coffee room and the interrogation room known as [...] "The Box". The actors began storing their actual belongings at <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> on the set, left real personal messages to each other on the bulletin boards, and got business cards with their characters' actual names for <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive {{to succeed in}} the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him [...] "ambition in its pure state". Like other persons of genius in La Comédie humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits– toiling at <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> throughout the night– are similar.|$|E

[...] About six weeks after the semester began, Giovanni {{wrote a letter to}} then-department head Lucinda Roy, who removed Cho from the class. Roy alerted the student affairs office, the dean's office, and the campus police, but each office responded that there was nothing they could do if Cho made no overt threats against himself or others. After Giovanni was informed of the massacre, she remarked that [...] " [...] knew when it happened that that's probably who it was," [...] and [...] "would have been shocked if it wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Each sitting day, {{normally}} at 5pm, MSPs {{decide on}} all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day. This [...] "Decision Time" [...] is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs {{who are not in}} the chamber to return and vote. At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking [...] "Are we all agreed?", to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces [...] "There will be a division" [...] and members vote by means of electronic consoles on <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote. As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.|$|E

He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to [...] "get out," [...] shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform {{at the front of the}} classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under <b>their</b> <b>desks.</b> Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E
500|$|The TVA {{campaign}} had put Carroll {{squarely in the}} public eye in McCracken County, and in 1962, {{he was elected to the}} first of five consecutive terms representing the county in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was chosen Speaker of the House from 1968 through 1970. In the 100-member House of Representatives, it was not uncommon for lobbyists to roam the floor freely, for members to bring their lunches to <b>their</b> <b>desks,</b> or for them to bring their friends and family members onto the floor during debate. Determined to bring a higher degree of decorum to the chamber's proceedings, Carroll opened the 1968 legislative session with a single, powerful whack of his gavel. The gavel shattered, stunning the legislators. Carroll subsequently barred outsiders from the floor during debate and forbade eating in the chamber. Carroll shattered three more gavels during the legislative session – he was finally given a sturdier one made of solid oak and formica – but he brought order to the chamber's proceedings. At the end of the session, a member of the opposing party declared from the floor [...] "The decorum of this House has improved 100 percent... I must compliment the present Speaker of this House for ... eliminating the abominable practices. Today every member has a right to speak ... without fear of interruption and catcalls or being shouted down." [...] The legislator's compliment was followed by a standing ovation for Carroll.|$|E
500|$|Wiene {{asked the}} actors to make {{movements}} similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, {{but also from}} Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that [...] "Veidt moves along the wall {{as if it had}} 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one", and Krauss [...] "moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in Caligari have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's [...] "strange, tormented face" [...] as Alan. He also cites Feher's [...] "large angular movements," [...] especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at <b>their</b> <b>desks</b> and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization.

40|$|Background: Prolonged, {{uninterrupted}} sitting time {{is associated}} with poor health outcomes. As most sitting time occurs at work, accurate, objective measurement of occupational sitting patterns is required to fully understand its effects on employee health. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine associations between desk-based sitting patterns, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI). Methods: Participants were full-time, office-based employees (N= 105; mean age 40. 9 ± 11. 5 years; BMI 26. 1 ± 3. 9, 65 % women). Sitting patterns (total desk-based sitting time and number of times employees got up from <b>their</b> <b>desk)</b> were assessed for five days using an objective measure of desk-based sitting, the sitting pad. WC, height and weight were measured, and BMI calculated (weight/height 2). Associations between sitting patterns, WC and BMI were tested using logistic regression models. Data were collected and analysed between 2011 / 12. Results: Those with high sitting time at <b>their</b> <b>desk</b> were 2. 7 times (95 % CI: 1. 3 to 6. 3) more likely to have WC ≥ 94 cm (men) or ≥ 80 cm (women), and 9. 0 times (95 % CI: 1. 9 to 41. 9) more likely to have BMI ≥ 30 than those with lower sitting time. There were no significant associations between the number of times employees got up from sitting at <b>their</b> <b>desk</b> and WC or BMI. Conclusion: High desk-based sitting time was associated with increased likelihood of weight related health outcomes whereas frequency of getting up from sitting at the desk was not. ...|$|R
