5|$|Another {{indirect}} effect of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> was {{the growth of}} gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "resource {{movement}} effect", <b>the</b> resource <b>boom</b> increases {{demand for}} labor, which causes production to shift toward <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> sector, {{away from the}} lagging sector.

However, this effect can be negligible, since the hydrocarbon and mineral sectors tend to employ few people.|$|R

5|$|The {{university}} system in Texas improved dramatically because of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Before <b>the</b> <b>boom,</b> the University of Texas {{consisted of a}} small number of crude buildings near Austin. Oil speculation on university land in western Texas {{led to the creation of}} the Santa Rita oil well, giving the University of Texas, and later Texas A University, access to a major source of revenue and leading the university to become among the wealthiest in the United States. Other universities in the state, especially the University of Houston, were also able to benefit from state-owned oil production and donations from wealthy oil investors, fueling substantial growth and development in their campuses.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the earlier years of <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their booms end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their local economies collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked {{in some of these}} smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> continued to varying degrees until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the earlier years largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized booms in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E

40|$|Booming" {{sand dunes}} {{are able to}} produce low-frequency sound that resembles a pure note from a music instrument. The sound has a {{dominant}} audible frequency (70 - 105 Hz) and several higher harmonics and may be heard from far distances away. A natural or induced avalanche from a slip face of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> dune triggers <b>the</b> emission that may last for several minutes. There are various references in travel literature to the phenomenon, but to date no scientific explanation covered all field observations. This thesis introduces a new physical model that describes <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>booming</b> dunes. <b>The</b> waveguide model explains the selection of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> frequency and <b>the</b> amplification of the sound in terms of constructive interference in a confined geometry. The frequency of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> is a direct function of the dimensions and velocities in the waveguide. The higher harmonics {{are related to the}} higher modes of propagation in the waveguide. The experimental validation includes quantitative field research at <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> dunes of <b>the</b> Mojave Desert and Death Valley National Park. Microphone and geophone recordings of the acoustic and seismic emission show a variation of booming frequency in space and time. The analysis of the sensor data quantifies wave propagation characteristics such as speed, dispersion, and nonlinear effects and allows the distinction between the source mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> and <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> itself. <b>The</b> migration of sand dunes results from a complicated interplay between dune building, wind regime, and precipitation. The morphological and morphodynamical characteristics of two field locations are analyzed with various geophysical techniques. Ground-penetrating radar images the subsurface structure of the dunes and reveal a natural, internal layering that {{is directly related to the}} history of dune migration. The seismic velocity increases abruptly with depth and gradually increases with downhill position due to compaction. Sand sampling shows local cementation of sand grains within the discrete layers that explains the increase in velocity and decrease in porosity. The subsurface layering may influence the speed of dune migration and therefore have important consequences on desertification. The positive qualitative and quantitative correlation between the subsurface layering in the dune and the manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> sound implies a close relation between environmental factors and <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> emission. In this thesis, <b>the</b> frequency of <b>booming</b> is correlated with the depth of the waveguide and the seismic velocities. The variability on location and season suggests that the waveguide theory successfully unravels <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>booming</b> sand dunes. </p...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>boom</b> {{in the oil}} {{industry}} also helped promote other industries {{in other areas of the}} state. Lumber production thrived as demand climbed for construction of railroads, refineries, and oil derricks, and, in 1907, Texas was the third largest lumber producer in the United States. Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry. Agriculture and ranching grew stronger as the rapidly expanding population created more demand for their produce.|$|E

On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail.
