50|$|The USGS model {{based on}} crustal {{abundance}} {{data and the}} reserve-abundance relationship of McKelvey, is applied to several metals in the Earth's crust (worldwide) and in the U.S. crust. The potential currently recoverable (present technology, economy) resources that come closest to the McKelvey relationship are {{those that have been}} sought for the longest time, such as copper, zinc, lead, silver, gold and molybdenum. Metals that do not follow the McKelvey relationship are ones that are byproducts (of major metals) or haven't been vital to the economy until recently (titanium, aluminum to a lesser degree). Bismuth {{is an example of a}} byproduct metal that doesn't follow the relationship very well; the 3% lead reserves in the western U.S. would have only 100 ppm bismuth, clearly too low-grade for a bismuth reserve.

40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to establish relationships between suspended sediment yield and nutrient export coefficient as the dependent variable, and runoff and catchment area as the independent variables. The established regression equation can be used to estimate suspended sediment or nutrient yield at any cross-section within the drainage basin with no sediment or nutrient data, if the mean annual runoff and catchment area are known. The equation {{can also be used to}} estimate the total suspended sediment and nutrient transport into the sea. The Pra basin of Ghana, which is made up of the Birim, Offin and Pra sub-basins, had PO 4 -P loads from mainly domestic, agricultural and commercial activities. The nutrient loads of Pra basin showed a general trend of increasing downstream. The high load of 14. 6 t day- 1 at Twifo-Praso is mainly due to palm oil production. Those of Dunkwa (1. 98 t day- 1) and Beposo (2. 74 t day- 1) were mainly due to domestic and commercial activities. The suspended sediment and nutrient transport into the sea are estimated by the model to be about 1. 2 Ã— 106 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> suspended sediment, 792 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> nitrates nitrogen, 3 kilo <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> ortho-phosphrous phosphate, 141 kilo <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> sulphate and 188 kilo <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> silicate...|$|R
40|$|The stock {{assessment}} of the marine crabs, Portunus (Portunus) sanguinolentus and Portunus (Portunus) pelagicus exploited by the mechanised trawl fishery was made based on the data collected from the commercial catches landed at Mangalore, Malpe and Kanvar; three important fish landing centres in the Karnataka state along the southwest coast of India during 1992 -' 94 and the results presented. In P. (P.) sanguinolentus, the mean values of total mortality coefficient (Z), natural mortality coefficient (M) and fishing mortality coefficient (F) were 4. 2 + 0. 51, 1. 6 and 2. 6 for males and 3. 9 + 0. 42, 1. 5 and 2. 4 for females respectively. In P. (P.) pelagicus, the average values of Z, M and F were 5. 6 + 0. 71, 1. 7 and 3. 9 for males and 4. 9 + 0. 69, 1. 6 and 3. 2 respectively for females. The standing stocks were 308 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> P (P.) sanguinolentus and 161 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> P. (P.) pelagicus. The annual average stocks were 1, 272 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> the former species and 834 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> the latter. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was 776 <b>tonnes</b> <b>for</b> P.

Based on the results obtained, it is felt imperative to increase the cod end mesh size of trawl to 40 mm and also to restrict the level of effort at the present level (1, 130 trawlers per day or 234 x lo 3 boat days) which would prevent overexploitation of the stocks of crabs in the coastal fishery sector of Karnataka...|$|R

40|$|Groundfish {{fisheries}} target {{big skate}} (Raja binoculata) off the British Columbia coast. Catch comes mainly from Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) and North Hecate Strait (NHS). Until now, sufficient data to evaluate stock status was not available. I parameterized a Graham-Schaefer model using catch (1996 - 2010), catch-per-unit-effort (1996 - 2010), and fishery-independent surveys (1984 - 2009) to estimate current abundance.
