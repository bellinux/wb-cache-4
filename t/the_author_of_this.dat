25|$|There {{had been}} {{an idea for a}} tour to England for some time and {{following}} the twin tours of Lord Hawke and Priestley to the West Indies in 1896-97 this idea was further developed and in June 1899 a combined West Indian eleven was invited to visit England. Lord Hawke was <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> invitation and he then arranged a series of matches for the summer of 1900. The initial selection of the West Indies team took place after the 1899-1900 Inter-Colonial Tournament in January 1900.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} do {{not consider}} Apostle Thomas <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> document and the author remains unknown. J. Menard produced {{a summary of the}} academic consensus in the mid-1970s which stated that the gospel was probably a very late text written by a Gnostic author, thus having very little relevance {{to the study of the}} early development of Christianity. Scholarly views of Gnosticism and the Gospel of Thomas have since become more nuanced and diverse. Paterson Brown, for example, has argued forcefully that the three Coptic Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth are demonstrably not Gnostic writings, since all three explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory and evil.|$|E
25|$|Despite this evidence, the {{surviving}} Hittite texts {{do not provide}} an independent account of the Trojan War.

King Muwatalli of the Hittites was the opponent of this king of Troy, and the result of Muwatalli's campaign is not recorded in {{the surviving}} texts. The Ahhiyawa, generally identified with the Achaean Greeks, are mentioned in the Tawagalawa letter as the neighbors of the kingdom of Wilusa, and who provided a refuge for the troublesome renegade Piyama-Radu. The Tawagalawa letter mentions that the Hittites and the Ahhiyawa fought a war over Wilusa.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Chief Justice, Marshall changed {{the manner in}} which the Supreme Court announced its decisions. Previously, each Justice would author a separate opinion (known as a seriatim opinion) as was done in the Virginia Supreme Court of his day and is still done today in the United Kingdom and Australia. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule. As Marshall was almost always <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole spokesman in important cases. Marshall also got rid of the tradition that U.S. Supreme Court justices had inherited from the British of wearing ornate powdered wigs and red robes with ermine trim.|$|E
25|$|It {{is hardly}} probable, however, {{that the present}} Book of Jubilees is incomplete, and a much more {{plausible}} view of Epstein's is that which regards the Midrash Tadshe {{as the work of}} Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan. Either on account of its beginning, or for some other reason, R. Phinehas ben Jair was regarded as <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> midrash, and Num. R. xiii. 10 and xiv. 12, 18 contain several expositions and maxims from it cited under the name of that tanna. The midrash, from which Yalḳuṭ excerpted several passages and which has been cited by various authors, has been edited according to manuscript sources by Adolf Jellinek (B. H. iii. 164-193) and by A. Epstein (Beiträge zur Jüdischen Alterthumskunde, Vienna, 1887).|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Uqair is multi-faceted. The {{irrigation}} channels north of Uqair {{could be the}} abandoned city of Gerrha. And it is alternatively possible the lost city lay beneath the subkha near the ruined Islamic city of Uqair. But Bibby's efforts to dig the channels and beneath the walls of Uqair proved fruitless {{in the search for}} Gerrha. (Looking for Dilmun, Geoffrey Bibby, p. 372). It is the belief of <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> article that the fort at Uqair is of Islamic origin and constructed by Arabs in defense and in anticipation of foreign attack, that eventually arrived in form of the Portuguese. Despite the lack of conclusively identifying its original builders, Uqair stands in quiet aura as a testimony to a mysterious and diverse cultural landscape that flourished in its proximity.|$|E

25|$|For the {{standard}} LH the 41-seat Plaxton coach and 43-seat ECW bus were most widely used; the bus bodies manufactured in Belfast by Alexander for Ulsterbus had 45 seats, East Midland Motor Services' ten 1969 buses {{were the only}} ones with Willowbrook bodies, as built they had 45 seats but with a 3+2 seating arrangement in three rows forward of the rear bench, making room for a pram pen, they were also unusual in carrying no grille badge, which puzzled <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sentence when he first came across a seemingly unidentifiable bus as a schoolboy in the mid 1970s. The LHS was produced as both buses and coaches with 26 to 35 seats. The LHL had up to 53 seats as a coach or 55 as a bus. Between 1975 and 1982 Vanplan built eight with delivery van bodies.|$|E

500|$|In 1807, an {{anonymous}} observer {{suggested that the}} term hoden {{was linked to the}} putative Anglo-Saxon god Woden, and that the tradition might be [...] "a relic of a festival to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in Thanet". In 1891, it was suggested that the custom had once been known as [...] "Odining", a reference to the Early Medieval Scandinavian god Odin. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> idea further suggested that the custom had begun either with the ritual wearing of the skins of horses sacrificed to Odin, or as an early Christian mockery of such Odinic practices.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the discourses, one week after Either/Or was published, Kierkegaard published a newspaper article in Fædrelandet, titled [...] "Who Is the Author Of Either/Or?", attempting to create authorial distance from the work, emphasizing {{the content of the}} work and the embodiment of a particular way of life in each of the pseudonyms. Kierkegaard, using the pseudonym 'A.F.', writes, [...] "most people, including <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> article, think it is not worth the trouble to be concerned about who the author is. They are happy not to know his identity, for then they have only the book to deal with, without being bothered or distracted by his personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E
500|$|To further fuel Winthrop's beliefs, Anne Hutchinson {{suffered}} from a miscarriage later {{in the same year}} when she aborted a strange mass of tissue that appeared like a handful of transparent grapes (a rare condition, mostly in woman over 45, called a hydatidiform mole). Winthrop was convinced of divine influence in these events, and made sure that every leader in New England received his own account of the [...] "monster" [...] birth, and he even sent a deposition to England. Soon, the story took {{on a life of its}} own, and in 1642 it was printed in London under the title Newes from New-England of a Most Strange and Prodigious Birth, brought to Boston in New-England... Though <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work was not named, it may have been the New England minister Thomas Weld who was in England at the time to support New England's ecclesiastical independence. In 1644 Weld, who was still in England, took Winthrop's account of the Antinomian Controversy, and published it under one title, and then added a preface of his own and republished it under the title A Short story of the Rise, reign and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists & Libertines... usually just called Short Story. In 1648 Samuel Rutherford, a Scottish Presbyterian, included Winthrop's account of the monster in his anti-sectarian treatise A Survey of the Spirituall Antichrist, Opening the Secrets of Familisme and Antinomianisme. Even the English writer, Samuel Danforth, included the birth in his 1648 Almanack as a [...] "memorable occurrence" [...] from 1637. [...] The only minister who wrote without sensationalism about Dyer's deformed infant was the Reverend John Wheelwright, Anne Hutchinson's ally during the Antinomian Controversy. In his 1645 response to Winthrop's Short Story, entitled Mercurius Americanus, he wrote that Dyer's and Hutchinson's monsters described by Winthrop were nothing but [...] "a monstrous conception of his [...] brain, a spurious issue of his intellect." ...|$|E
