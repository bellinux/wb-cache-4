40|$|Automatic cassava slicer system {{project and}} {{realization}} has been done. This tool {{can be used}} in home industy (specially at crispy cassava maker). This system consists of hardware and software. The hardware consists of AC motor, stepping motor, power circuit, darlington circuit, microcontroller AT 89 S 51 circuit and <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> The software use assembly Reads 51 programming. The first step to start the work system are arrange the tick of cassava, then put cassava at the cassava place.
