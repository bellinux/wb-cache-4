5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E

All methods used in this paper are quite standard in probability in Banach spaces except for some modifications. We {{made an effort to}} solve this problem completely in a Banach space using both the isoperimetric methods and the Gaussian randomization technique, but we were not successful...|$|R

This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E
