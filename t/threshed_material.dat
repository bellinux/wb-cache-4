40|$|ABSTRACT. ABSTRACT. The petals of {{marigold}} flowers (Tagetes erecta) {{are commonly}} used as a feed supplement by the poultry industry to enhance broiler skin and yolk coloration. This research examined {{the effectiveness of a}} threshing device for removing petals from Orange Lady marigold flowers by scrubbing dried flowers between two moving plates. Thresher–associated independent variables were plate speed and distance between plates (plate gap). Flower moisture content was the independent variable representing flower properties. Efficacy was determined by measuring the threshing efficiencies and the percent trash (MOP, material other than petals) present in the <b>threshed</b> <b>material.</b> Results show smaller plate gaps had higher threshing efficiencies and increased MOP in the harvested samples. Threshing efficiencies ranged from 34 % to 98 % for high and low flower moisture contents respectively. Plate speeds ranging from 156 to 936 mm/sec had no effect on threshing efficiency...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Marigold petals can be {{detached}} from flowers by tumbling while being dried in a rotary heated–air dryer. This {{study examined the}} effect of dryer diameter, RPM, airflow, and flower compaction on threshing petals from marigold flowers using two types of rotary dryers. A sectored rotary dryer was tested at three rotational speeds (2, 4, and 8 rpm) and two diameters (1. 2 and 1. 8 m). An open–chamber rotary dryer was tested with three levels of flower compaction (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 X) and three airflows (4. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 3 changes/min). Both the sectored and open chamber dryers performed well in drying and threshing petals from flowers. In most tests, more than 80 % of the petals were threshed when their moisture dropped to less than 10 %, i. e., within 20 to 24 h of drying. Threshing performance was different between the sectored and open dryer. The sectored dryer had a relatively large increase in the threshing rate after 10 to 15 h of drying while the open dryer’s threshing rates remained fairly constant. The open dryer produced more threshed, high moisture petals. <b>Threshed</b> <b>material</b> from both dryers contained an insignificant amount of trash. The threshing characteristics for both dryer types were unaffected by changes in operating speed, amount of compaction, and airflow. However, by using higher compaction, the open dryer can thresh 50 to 100 % more flowers...|$|E
40|$|Coffee {{ranks as}} one of the world's most {{valuable}} and widely traded commodity crops and is an important export product of several countries. The objective of this research is to design, construct and evaluate a machine for <b>threshing</b> coffee. The <b>material</b> of construction was selected based on strength, availability, durability and corrosiveness. The main component parts of the machine include: shaft (300 rpm and diameter 25 mm), concave sieve (Ø 10 mm), the threshing head, sieve and blower which was made from 1. 5 mm thick sheet metal. The moisture content of the coffee is determined in the laboratory using conventional oven drying method and computed to give the following moisture content: 4. 6...|$|R
40|$|Emmer-wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon) was the {{dominant}} crop cultivated in ancient Egypt, but was gradually replaced by hard-wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) during the Ptolemaic period (later the Roman period). Hard-wheat was {{in contrast to}} emmer-wheat a free-threshing cereal. Threshing hard-wheat resulted in large numbers of threshing remains. This provided the opportunity to use threshing remains, among others, as temper in the fabrication of mud-bricks in construction. However, archaeobotanical research of threshing remains (rachis fragments in particular) in mud-bricks from Roman Karanis showed {{that they were not}} directly used in the production of bricks. Instead, after <b>threshing</b> the <b>material</b> was treated a second time, what resulted in higher expenses and extra time. 	This is an interesting observation {{in the study of the}} dynamics of the agricultural economy in the town of Karanis. This thesis focusses upon the economic use of threshing remains in Roman Karanis. The following text will explore the link between the available threshing remains on the one hand and their use as temper in the production of mud-bricks on the other hand. The aim of this research is to reconstruct the logistic of the construction of houses in Karanis. Central to this study are several questions: How many threshing remains were on average needed for the production of a single brick? Which processes were applied to the material before adding them as temper in mud-bricks and why?...|$|R
50|$|The museum {{exhibits}} {{objects that}} are mainly loaned from a society for local history. They are primarily old objects {{that were used in}} the past, such as weighing instruments, <b>threshing</b> and transport <b>material,</b> archival pieces regarding local societies, municipal governments and economic activities. In addition, there are artefacts that were used for farming purposes and folkloric instruments of craftsmen and other professions. Furthermore, there are also artefacts relating to the monarchy, the church life, the world wars and historiographical accounts and flags of Zaventem. Outside large agricultural instruments are exhibited like ploughs, and harvesting machines to grub up chicory. The building of the museum was erected in 1957 as a storage place in the architectural style of a 17th-century house to refer to the houses that {{used to be in the}} area during that century. In 1977, the building was fully restored and converted into the local history museum.|$|R
40|$|Soybean seed var. Argomulyo {{has been}} {{processed}} and dried to < 10 % moisture content. Seeds were stored in 3 {{different kinds of}} plastic packaging ie. HDPE, hermetic plastic and vacuum plastic {{for a period of}} 6 months at room temperature. The research aims to determine the best type of plastic packaging for soybean seed. The experimental design was arranged in RBD consisting of 2 block and 1 factor; different engine rotation n speed (rpm) <b>threshing</b> and packaging <b>material.</b> Sample was carried out every month until 6 months of storage. The following analyses were carried out: moisture content, germination, damaged grains, additional weight and free fatty acid (FFA). Result show that kinds of packaging significantly affect moisture content and additional weights. It was found that seed moisture contentin HDPE packaging was increase and showed positive correlation with additional weight. Engine rotation speed (rpm) threshing was significantly affect damaged grains that high rpm showed positively corelation with increasing damaged grain. Percent of FFA < 0. 4 % untill 6 months of storage. From this research, soybean seed was stored in hermetic plastic observed have the ability to maintain moisture content and hold up additional weight followed by vacuum plastic and HDPE. Soybean seed were stored in HDPE, hermetic plastic and vacuum plastic have percent of germination ≥ 70 % after 6 months stored and moisture content < 10 %...|$|R
40|$|In crop {{biofortification}} research, threshing part is {{the primary}} place of contamination while dealing with grain mineral traits such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) density, thus type of threshing operation {{is one of the}} important and effective factors for efficient grain mineral traits determination. This study is aimed at the effects of threshing methods namely power-operated single-head thresher and manual-hand threshing on Fe and Zn density estimation. In this context, 50 pearl millet progenies each from two broad-based populations (AIMP 92901 and ICMR 312) were evaluated in field condition and tested for machine and hand threshing. Grain samples were analyzed for Fe and Zn density using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical-Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) method. The analysis of variance showed the significant difference among population progenies for these micronutrients by recording two-fold variations for Fe (40 - 91 mg kg- 1) and Zn (32 - 74 mg kg- 1) density. Threshing method had significant effect, however, estimated Fe and Zn values from both the methods were highly comparable, further non-significant t-test and linear correlations-coefficients showed machine-threshed samples results were highly positively significantly correlated with hand-threshed samples values for both micronutrients (r= 0. 88 to 0. 93; p< 0. 01 for Fe and r= 0. 92 to 0. 95; p< 0. 01 for Zn) in two populations. This study indicating the high levels of consistency on ranking of test entries and threshing method has no effect on grain Fe and Zn estimation. Therefore, single-head thresher will be a reliable and faster method for large-number of breeding <b>materials</b> <b>threshing</b> and its grain micronutrient determination in pearl millet biofortification...|$|R
