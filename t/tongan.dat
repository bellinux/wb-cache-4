5|$|Morton and {{his colleagues}} {{anticipated}} that copies {{of the new book}} would be prepared quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written <b>Tongan</b> language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with <b>Tongan</b> grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The <b>Tongan</b> version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Tahiti rail has {{historically}} been confused with the extant <b>Tongan</b> subspecies of the buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus, which was also illustrated and described by the Forsters. In his 1783 description of the <b>Tongan</b> bird (wherein it was named Rallus eucaudata), the English ornithologist John Frederick Miller erroneously gave its locality as Tahiti, which led the Tahiti rail {{to be regarded as}} a junior synonym of the extant bird. He based his description on Forster's illustration (plate no.127) of the <b>Tongan</b> bird, and Latham and Gmelin later repeated Miller's erroneous locality. The 1844 publication of Forster's description listed the <b>Tongan</b> bird as a variety of the Tahitian species, and similar schemes were suggested by later writers until 1953, when the New Zealand biologist Averil Margaret Lysaght pointed out Miller's locality mistake, which had been overlooked until that point, and kept the two birds separate. In spite of the clarification, the <b>Tongan</b> bird was placed on a list of extinct birds in the 1981 book Endangered Birds of the World, and Forster's plate of the Tahiti rail was used to illustrate the Samoan wood rail (Gallinula pacifica), a completely different species, in the 1989 book Le Grand Livre des Espécies Disparues.|$|E
5|$|Missionaries {{were sent}} to Tonga once again in 1907 {{as part of the}} Samoan Mission. Missionaries began a church school in Nieafu which gained 28 primary-age {{students}} and 13 young adult night students by 1908. A branch, or a small congregation, was organized in the Vava'u village of Ha'alaufuli with 32 members. Missionaries began preaching in Tongatapu, the main island of Tonga, in March 1911. Due to the success of these missionaries, the <b>Tongan</b> Mission was established in 1916. At this time, there were 450 <b>Tongan</b> LDS members, eleven branches, two conferences and 12 missionaries within the mission.|$|E
50|$|Although Ata {{must have}} been known to <b>Tongans</b> from times immemorial, as it {{features}} in old myths, it may have been mixed up with Atā, and it is alleged not to have been remembered until the <b>Tongans</b> were told about it by the Europeans. In fact the following myth is rather from the original <b>Tongans</b> in the Lau Islands (Fiji) than from Tonga proper itself.|$|R
40|$|Aim : The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the body image and body change strategies of adolescents from Tonga, and <b>Tongans</b> who are resident New Zealand. Method : In total, 598 <b>Tongans</b> from Tonga and 388 <b>Tongans</b> from New Zealand completed measures of body image, body change strategies and messages about their body. Results : <b>Tongans</b> in Tonga were more likely to receive positive messages about a larger body from adults at school, church and the media, and losing weight from the media. They were also more likely to adopt strategies to lose weight, increase weight and increase muscles. Conclusion : The large body ideal appears to be still valued in Tonga, whereas <b>Tongans</b> also want to lose weight because of media messages to achieve a healthy body weight. <br /...|$|R
50|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has {{assisted}} <b>Tongans</b> {{in immigration}} to the United States by providing student and work visas, employment, and the opportunity for <b>Tongans</b> of marriageable age to meet spouses.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the temple was completed ten days ahead of schedule, allowing for more non-member guests to visit the temple before the dedication. The King of Tonga was given a private tour of the temple by previous <b>Tongan</b> mission president John Groberg to explain {{the purposes of the}} building. Before its formal dedication, over 50 percent of the <b>Tongan</b> population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley as Kimball was ill and could not attend the dedication. There were seven dedicatory sessions held, most of which took place in the Liahona School gymnasium. 15,000 people were in attendance of these sessions.|$|E
5|$|The LDS Church {{sent the}} first Mormon missionaries to Tonga, Brigham Smoot and Alva J. Butler, in July 1891. Upon arriving, {{they met with}} the <b>Tongan</b> king, George Tupou I, to obtain his {{permission}} to preach. Smoot and Butler bought property and built a mission home, a school, and also purchased a boat to facilitate travel between the islands. The missionaries baptized their first convert, Alipate, in July of the following year. Between 1891 and 1897, missionaries preached and opened schools in various groups of islands including Tongatapu, Ha'apai, and Vava'u. Little progress was made {{during the first few}} years as only 16 Tongans joined the LDS Church. Despite apparent interest in the LDS Church among Tongans, European ministers of other Christian churches caused hesitation after initiating exaggerated rumors regarding polygamy and early church leaders Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. In 1897, the First Presidency of the LDS Church recommended the closing of the <b>Tongan</b> Conference due to its slow progress. Consequently, the First Presidency removed LDS missionaries from Tonga and transferred them to the Samoan Mission.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from {{beneath the surface of}} Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a <b>Tongan</b> sea spirit, respectively).|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand connection, as for Samoa, {{has been}} a mixed blessing, since {{on the one hand}} it means that <b>Tongans</b> can play in a major field, but on the other hand, winning a cap for the All Blacks is a major {{ambition}} for many <b>Tongans.</b>|$|R

5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, which represented approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 <b>Tongan</b> census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead of Catholicism and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} the <b>Tongan</b> islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E
5|$|Americans with origins {{from the}} Pacific are the {{smallest}} minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 Native Hawaiians, 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 {{people from other}} groups. Samoan Americans were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of Euless, a suburb of Fort Worth, contains a sizable population of <b>Tongan</b> Americans, at nearly 900 people, over {{one percent of the}} city's population. Killeen has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} the Adelante (on which the <b>Tongans</b> were put) finally left on 2 October 1863, many of the <b>Tongans</b> had already died or were dying from {{contagious}} diseases. Captain Escurra of the Adelante (formerly a successful slaver), pocketed his fee of $30/head, but dumped them on uninhabited Cocos Island. He later claimed that the 426 kanakas were affected with smallpox and a danger to his crew. When the whaler Active visited the island on 21 October, its crew found some 200 <b>Tongans</b> still alive. A month later the Peruvian warship Tumbes went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to Paita, where they were apparently absorbed into the local population.|$|R
5|$|Ana Po'uhila {{participated in}} the women's shot put on the behalf of Tonga at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only female athlete {{competing}} for Tonga at the 2008 Olympic games. She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary <b>Tongan</b> island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first {{participated in the}} Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga in shot put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing {{at the age of}} 32. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on August 15, the <b>Tongan</b> field athlete was placed in the seventeen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot as far as she could. During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 16.21meters, ranking 12th in her heat. She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35meters, did not beat her second attempt. Using her best mark, 16.42meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's Lin Chia-Ying (16.32meters) and behind Russia's Irina Khudoroshkina (16.84meters) in a heat led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Of the 33 athletes who finished the event, Ana Po'uhila ranked 27th. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E
5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 and led to a great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to <b>Tongan</b> students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job in America. Today, the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E
5|$|In Tonga initial reports, {{suggested}} that only vegetation had been impacted. However, {{it was later}} reported that power lines had been knocked down by high winds and the heavy rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Power stations in Tongatapu were also forced to close to protect the system. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses. The <b>Tongan</b> Meteorological Service also reported that about $2,000 2009TOP, ($1,000 2009USD) worth of damage had been done to property owned by the service.|$|E

We examined levels of adiponectin and its insulin-sensitising HMW isoform and their relationship with metabolic parameters in <b>Tongans,</b> a population prone to type II diabetes. Methods. Adiponectin and its HMW isoform were quantitated by Elisa in specimens from a randomly recruited, multistage cluster population survey of <b>Tongans</b> and from a group of Caucasians. Anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical data were collected on each subject. Results. Both male and female <b>Tongans</b> had lower levels of total and HMW adiponectin than their Caucasian counterparts. Levels of total and HMW adiponectin were higher in females thanmales in each group. Adiponectin levels were inversely related to BMI, weight, andHOMA in Tonganmales and females, as well as to dyslipidemia in both sexes.

5|$|On December30, just a {{day before}} Waka passed through Tonga, {{warnings}} were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying <b>Tongan</b> capital of Nuku'alofa as a Category3 cyclone. Owing to warnings from local media, all New Year's Eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended.

5|$|The Tahiti rail, Tahitian red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail (Gallirallus pacificus) is an {{extinct species}} of rail that lived on Tahiti. It was first {{recorded}} during James Cook's second voyage {{around the world}} (1772–1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. The Tahiti rail {{appears to have been}} closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the <b>Tongan</b> subspecies of that bird.|$|E
