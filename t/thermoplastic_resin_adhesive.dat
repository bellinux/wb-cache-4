Since products of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> have great variability in physical and mechanical properties, clinicians should utilize them with careful {{consideration of the}} specific properties of each product. In general, <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> has lower color-stability and higher risk for fracture than polymethyl methacrylate. Additionally, the surface of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> becomes roughened more easily than polymethyl methacrylate. Studies related to material properties of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin,</b> treatment efficacy and follow-up are insufficient to provide definitive conclusions at this time. Therefore, this {{position paper}} should be revised based on future studies and a clinical guideline should be provided...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{position}} paper proposes a definition and naming standard for removable partial dentures (RPDs) using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin,</b> and presents a guideline for clinical application. A panel of 14 experts having broad experience with clinical application of RPDs using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> was selected {{from members of}} the Japan Prosthodontic Society. At a meeting of the panel, “non-metal clasp denture” was referred as the generic name of RPDs with retentive elements (resin clasps) made of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin.</b> The panel classified non-metal clasp dentures into two types: one with a flexible structure that lacks a metal framework and the other having a rigid structure that includes a metal framework. According to current prosthetic principles, flexible non-metal clasp dentures are not recommended as definitive dentures, except for limited cases such as patients with a metal allergy. Rigid non-metal clasp dentures are recommended in cases where patients will not accept metal clasps for esthetic reasons. Non-metal clasp dentures should follow the same design principles as conventional RPDs using metal clasps...|$|R

40|$|To {{deal with}} {{environmental}} issues, the gasoline mileage of passenger cars {{can be improved}} by reduction of the car weight. Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTP), which are superior in specific strength and specific modulus, {{is expected to be}} used for car body. Many pipe-shaped members have been used for structural materials for cars, and low cost and high-speed molding method for CFRTP pipe has been required. Although rapid heating process of mold has been developed by applying high-frequency direct resistance heating to the mold itself in previous studies, sufficient mechanical properties of CFRTP pipe could not be obtained because of the high viscosity of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin.</b> In CFRTP molding, impregnation improvement of the resin is one of the important issues to be solved. In this study, carbon fiber <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> pre-impregnated sheet, which was impregnated with <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> beforehand, is used as molding material {{to improve the quality of}} the CFRTP pipe.

They were impregnated with wood-preservative (ACQ), and exposed under outdoor conditions with their glue-layers at level position for ten years.

After 10  years of exposure, significant differences were recognized for shear-strength among <b>adhesive</b> <b>resins</b> {{as the result of}} analysis of coefficient variance (AOCV). Results for pair-comparison of AOCV between <b>adhesive</b> <b>resins,</b> showed significant differences in four pair-comparisons and those included VAE. Standard deviations of shear-strength tend to increase with exposure year, and for VAE they were larger than for the others. Results of goodness-of-fit tests of shear-strength for normal, log-normal, 2 P-Weibull, and 3 P-Weibull distributions, showed that none of these forms fit VAE after 1  year of exposure.

25|$|B-72 is a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> {{that was}} created by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an {{adhesive}} specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic <b>resin</b> as an <b>adhesive,</b> as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examined}} micro-morphological features {{responsible for}} the crystallinity of cured urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesives, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to identify and characterize distinctive crystalline structures in resins obtained with different formaldehyde to urea (F/U) mole ratios and hardener levels. The TEM examination of cured UF <b>resin</b> <b>adhesives</b> impregnated into wood cell lumen revealed the presence of spherical particles with variable diameter and number per unit area. The diameter and number/area of the spherical particles increase for decreasing F/U mole ratio and decrease {{with an increase in}} the hardener levels, an effect which is closely related to their crystallinity. Therefore, the present findings suggest that the spherical particles are {{responsible for the}} crystallinity of cured UF <b>resin</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The results also indicate that crystalline structures represent an inherent feature of cured UF <b>resin</b> <b>adhesives,</b> particularly for low F/U mole ratios, even though these resins are usually classified as amorphous and cross-linked thermosetting polymers...|$|R
