5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, this meant that if <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was {{the first}} {{official}} challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned <b>the</b> <b>champions.</b> The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, <b>the</b> <b>champions</b> of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated <b>the</b> <b>champions</b> 2–0 {{and became the first}} team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to issues}} {{regarding}} his legal {{status in the}} Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o. He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, where he played his best match to that point. After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for <b>the</b> <b>Champions</b> League final, but on 17 May, {{the day of the}} final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.|$|E
