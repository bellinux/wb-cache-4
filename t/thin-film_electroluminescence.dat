30|$|Doping, the {{intentional}} incorporation of impurities into materials, {{is a primary}} means of tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of bulk semiconductors. As you know, rare earth (RE) elements are effective luminescent centers for RE-doped semiconductors because the excitation of RE ions can occur by the recombination of the photogenerated carriers confined in semiconductors and subsequent energy transfer to RE ions [15]. Therefore, RE-doped II–VI materials are promising candidates for application in color <b>thin-film</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> devices, nonlinear optics, and multicolor optical switches [16, 17]. Rare earth doping may {{play an important role}} in obtaining highly efficient multicolor photodetectors and upconversion signals.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new type of}} a <b>thin-film</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> (TFEL) device with nanostructured (NS) -ZnS:Mn utilizing its enhanced luminescent efficiency due to the quantum confinement (QC) effects. As NS-ZnS:Mn, ZnS:Mn/Si 3 N 4 multilayers with thicknesses of 1. 93. 5 nm for ZnS were prepared by a rf-magnetron sputtering method. From the results of grazing incidence X-ray reflectomerry and X-ray diffractmerry, formation of ZnS:Mn nanocrystals in the ZnS layers are confirmed. With a decrease in the ZnS:Mn layer thickness, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency associated with the Mn 2 + transitions is increased, and the PL excitation spectmrn is shifted toward higher energies, indicating appearance of the QC effects...|$|E

The crystal composition and structure of Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 :Ag were studied by x-ray powder diffraction, The Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 :Ag has a photoluminescence emission which peaked at around 397 and 467 nm, which were attributed to the oxide vacancies and Ag+, respectively. The brightness of 32 cd/m(2) was obtained when an alternating voltage of 130 V at 1 kHz was applied. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S 0003 - 6951 (00) 05031 - 2]...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} irradiation of the substrate during the growth of Al-doped ZnS thin films by the electron-beam evaporation method. The light-induced effects on the growth of Al-doped ZnS by electron-beam evaporation method have been demonstrated. It {{has been found that}} the preferential orientation of the film was enhanced and the doping efficiency of A 1 in the ZnS host material was affected by the irradiation with a low-pressure ttg lamp. A model of the light interaction with the substrate is proposed which is in agreement with the observed red shift of the photoluminescence depending both on the A 1 content and on the position of the A 1 dopant in the ZnS lattice. ZnS is, so far, {{one of the most widely}} studied host mate-rials for <b>thin-film</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> structures. Because of the wide direct bandgap of the ILVI compound semi-conductors, especially ZnS and ZnSe, they are promising materials for high-efficiency blue light emitting devices. Current research is focused on the growth of large area ZnS thin films of uniform thickness, with improved crys-tatlinity and controlled properties like dopant incorpora...|$|E
40|$|We have {{discovered}} perovskite <b>thin-film</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> (PEL), {{opening up a}} new optical application of perovskite materials[1]. All of the films were prepared by the conventional pulsed laser deposition method. Base insulating layer SrTiO 3, phosphor layer ((Ca 0. 6 Sr 0. 4) 0. 997 Pr 0. 002) TiO 3 and top insulating layer SrTiO 3 were successively grown on a 1 mol % Nb-doped SrTiO 3 (100) substrate. After post-annealing, the transparent SnO 2 top electrodes were grown. With increasing driving voltage, the intensity of electroluminescence dramatically increases. The sharp electroluminescence peak at around 610 nm at 12 V becomes much stronger with increasing ac voltage. High-quality red color is produced and the working voltage for whole-surface electroluminescence is as low as 10 V. The mechanism behind this electroluminescence {{is thought to be}} the transition of Pr 3 + ions from the 1 D 2 state to the 3 H 4 state. The dielectric constant of the SrTiO 3 epitaxial films used as insulating layers and ((Ca 0. 6 Sr 0. 4) 0. 997 Pr 0. 002) TiO 3 epitaxial films used as phosphor layers are 51 and 5 at room temperature, respectively. This value of SrTiO 3 epitaxial films is consistent with that in a previous report. [2] The equivalent circuit of thin films EL device is simply a three series connected capacitors. [3] The insulating capacitance Ci and phosphor capacitance Cp are presented as Ci = 0 riS/ti and Cp= 0 rpS/tp, respectively, where S is the surface electrode area, ri and rp are the dielectric constants of insulator and phosphor layers, ti and tp are the thickness of insulator and phosphor layers, respectively. In this case, more than 90 % of source voltage is applied to phosphor layer according to alternating current theory. Therefore, the electric field of phosphor layer at the starting for electroluminescence is about 9. 0 × 104 Vcm- 1. This value is one order magnitude smaller than that of other electroluminescence by rare-earth-ion-activated phosphor materials. We also prepared a SrTiO 3...|$|E
