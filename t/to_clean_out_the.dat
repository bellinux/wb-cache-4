As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{symptoms}} of external otitis lead many people to attempt <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, self-cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs.|$|E
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E

50|$|Internal {{staining}} {{is common}} following root canal treatment, however the exact causes for this {{are not completely}} understood. Failure <b>to</b> completely <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> necrotic soft tissue of the pulp system may cause staining, and certain root canal materials (e.g., gutta percha and root canal sealer cements) can also. Another possible factor {{is the lack of}} pulp pressure in dentinal tubules once the pulp is removed, leading to incorporation of dietary stains in dentin.|$|R
25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E
25|$|The queen {{serves as}} the primary egg layer of the nest and begins the nest {{construction}} {{at the beginning of}} a season. If she adopt an already existing nest, it is her duty <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> nest and prepare it for egg laying. The queen is the top of the caste system and dominates in any dominance interaction with a subordinate. These interactions are fairly common for the queen. Queens tend to forage mainly for pulp, but they have sometimes been observed foraging for insects as well. While queens rarely forage for nectar, co-foundresses and workers do so frequently. Workers are also in charge of distributing food to other adults and larvae when they return from foraging. Workers are key in building cells and raising their walls. Non-workers, on the other hand, rarely forage themselves and depend on the collections of food that foragers bring back to the nest; this behavior defines non-workers. This caste has also been observed to leave the nest for extended periods of time to either mate or forage for themselves. They do, however, contribute to defense of the nest. There have also been examples of non-workers breaking down cell walls after larvae have matured, so it seems like the distinction between worker and non-worker is less clear than was previously thought. Finally, males aid in keeping the nest cool in hot temperatures by fanning their wings and they rely heavily on the food that foragers bring back to the nest. They sometimes swarm the foragers in order to get the nectar, pulp, and insects that the foragers bring.|$|E
500|$|It {{was thought}} that the failure had been caused by there being too much {{remaining}} superstructure, and attempts were made <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> large quantity of oil that had spilled out during the attempt to raise her.

500|$|Once on site, {{they would}} be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some {{protection}} to the artillery crew. Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation. The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although {{there was still no}} effort to standardise calibres. The usual loading equipment consisted of a copper loading scoop, a ramrod, and a felt brush or [...] "sponge". A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon. Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool down the barrel, while acids could also be added to the water <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> inside of the barrel. Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going.|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{one hundred}} Kaiju and one hundred Jaegers were designed, {{but only a}} {{fraction}} of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would [...] "do an American Idol" [...] and vote for the best. In designing Kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. The director commented: [...] "Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, {{but on the other hand}} they come sort of in families: you've got the reptilian Kaiju, the insect Kaiju, the sort of crustacean Kaiju… So to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting." [...] Del Toro avoided making the Kaiju too similar to any Earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. Del Toro called the film's Kaiju [...] "weapons", stating that they are [...] "the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mice." [...] Certain design elements are shared by all the Kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. Each Kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early Japanese Kaiju films. While del Toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the Kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.|$|E
500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E
50|$|Maggot {{therapy is}} the {{intentional}} introduction of live, disinfected blow fly larvae (maggots) into soft tissue wounds <b>to</b> selectively <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> necrotic tissue. This helps to prevent infection; it also speeds healing of chronically infected wounds and ulcers. Military surgeons since classical antiquity noticed that wounds {{which had been}} left untreated for several days, and which had become infested with maggots, healed better than wounds not so infested. Maggots secrete several chemicals that kill microbes, including allantoin, urea, phenylacetic acid, phenylacetaldehyde, calcium carbonate, proteolytic enzymes, and many others.|$|R

2500|$|Various authors give {{examples}} of instigation of whisper campaigns. Childers cites {{the fact that}} rumours were spread by the Israeli forces that they possessed the atomic bomb. Morris cites Yigal Allon, the Palmach commander, describing such a campaign: [...] "I gathered the Jewish mukhtars, who had ties with the different Arab villages, and I asked them to whisper in the ears of several Arabs that giant Jewish reinforcements had reached the Galilee and were about <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> villages of the Hula, [...] to advise them, as friends, to flee while they could.

That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples.

50|$|Because {{of the way}} {{the water}} is applied in a drip system, {{traditional}} surface applications of timed-release fertilizer are sometimes ineffective, so drip systems often mix liquid fertilizer with the irrigation water. This is called fertigation; fertigation and chemigation (application of pesticides and other chemicals <b>to</b> periodically <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> system, such as chlorine or sulfuric acid) use chemical injectors such as diaphragm pumps, piston pumps, or aspirators. The chemicals may be added constantly whenever the system is irrigating or at intervals. Fertilizer savings of up to 95% are being reported from recent university field tests using drip fertigation and slow water delivery as compared to timed-release and irrigation by micro spray heads.|$|R

2500|$|Gwynn in 1991 passed Gene Richards as the Padres' all-time {{leader in}} steals and triples. He reached a season-high batting average of [...]373 in June, and {{late in the}} month was among the league leaders in RBIs. His left knee began causing him {{problems}} before the All-Star break, {{and he had been}} suffering from shin splints as well. He injured his left knee on August 5 at Houston while sliding into second base. He played through the injury, missing just one game over the next [...] weeks. He had fluid drained from his knee on August 31, and played just once in the week that followed while surgery was discussed. He attempted to finish out the season, but lasted just five more games. He underwent arthroscopic surgery <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> knee and smooth the articular cartilage, missing the final 21 games of the year.

2500|$|Dentists {{and dental}} hygienists measure {{periodontal}} disease using a device called a periodontal probe. [...] This thin [...] "measuring stick" [...] is gently placed {{into the space}} between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline. [...] If the probe can slip more than [...] below the gumline, the patient is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred. [...] This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket. [...] However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the patient, with a toothbrush) if they are 3mm or less in depth. [...] This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought. [...] When the pocket depths reach [...] in depth, the hand instruments and cavitrons used by the dental professionals may not reach deeply enough into the pocket <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth. [...] An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the patient to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as minocycline) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the patient at home with his or her toothbrush.|$|E
