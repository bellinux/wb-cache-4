5|$|Haze {{entered the}} adult film {{industry}} on July 18, 2001. Between 2002 and 2005, {{she was a}} contract girl for the film company Jill Kelly Productions. During {{most of her time}} at the company, she performed exclusively with women, out of loyalty to her then boyfriend, an industry cameraman. She returned <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> men in the 2006 multi-award-winning release Jenna Haze Darkside, produced by Jules Jordan.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{confirmed}} that players would reprise {{the role of}} Gordon Freeman, unlike the original Half-Life expansion packs, which all dealt with different characters. Valve decided to develop Episode One in-house, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> outside contractors as with previous expansions, because the company was already comfortable with the technology and construction tools of Half-Life 2.|$|E
5|$|Moore's first {{deployment}} as {{an artist}} was with the RAAF in Papua New Guinea in early 1944. His earlier watercolour paintings, made in Milne Bay and Goodenough Island, were destroyed by wet weather and humidity; he subsequently changed <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> oils, which were more suitable for the tropical environment.|$|E

5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{a report}} in January 2009, the city council {{recommended}} that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved {{the replacement of the}} steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.|$|E
5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, {{he wrote}} The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and {{was put on}} each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who support it.|$|E

5|$|Haze {{became a}} free agent in April 2005, after {{deciding}} not to renew her contract with JKP, partly because Jill Kelly had recently left the company. After leaving JKP and splitting with her boyfriend, Haze returned <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> male performers. The April 2006 release Jenna Haze Darkside featured her first boy-girl scenes in over three years. The film was produced and directed by her new boyfriend Jules Jordan. Later in the year, she began writing a sex advice column for the pornographic magazine, Fox.|$|E
5|$|Heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Evander Holyfield guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, appearing at the mall to help train Phineas for the big thumb wrestling match against Buford. Holyfield's guest performance was heavily expected since the original announcement of guest stars lined up for the series released in September 2007. Cast members response <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Holyfield was highly positive; Vincent Martella and Alyson Stoner, who portray Phineas and Isabella respectively, cited working along guest stars like him as a benefit of working on the show.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the case, significant sections in Decay are dedicated <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E

5|$|Raimi {{asked for}} help and {{assistance}} from several {{of his friends and}} past collaborators to make The Evil Dead. Campbell was cast as Ash Williams, the main character. To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in The Detroit News. Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Raimi.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Newman, who had {{previously}} worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road, replaced David Arnold as composer, becoming the ninth composer in the series' history. When asked about the circumstances surrounding his departure from the role, David Arnold commented that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The soundtrack album was released on 29 October 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 2012 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the Royal Theatre, {{his piece}} The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding {{at the position}} of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E

5|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and driving. Among the first horses used for classical dressage, they are still making a mark in international competition in dressage today. At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish dressage team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical dressage. Historically, however, they were also used as stock horses, especially suited <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known for their use in mounted bull fighting. Mares were traditionally used for la trilla, the Spanish process of threshing grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test of endurance, hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Xenosaga Episode II was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe. The two worked respectively on the cinematic and gameplay tracks; {{they did not}} collaborate on any tracks, or even meet during the game's production. Hosoe, whose previous work included Street Fighter EX and the Ridge Racer series, was forced to greatly restrict his compositions' quality due <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the limited sound hardware on the PS2. He felt that both the sound quality and overall direction of the soundtrack were faulted because of this. Kajiura, whose previous work consisted mostly of anime scores, felt that the game's soundtrack was different from her earlier work due to the different pieces linking with each other, although some tracks were split up by the production team when she composed them to merge as a single melody. She also found it easier working from Mitsuda's rather than creating a completely original score. The realistic art design also influenced Kajura's work, as she wished to complement it. Kajura's compositions were released on a two-disc album in July 2004, while some of Hosoe's music was released on a promotional disc {{as part of the}} North American strategy guide. The rest of Hosoe's music for the game has yet to receive an album release.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself <b>to</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
