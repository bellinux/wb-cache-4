500|$|When Locke {{began writing}} {{the letters that}} would {{eventually}} become Some Thoughts on Education, he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: [...] "I place Vertue [...] as {{the first and most}} necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." [...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated {{that some of}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{may have led to}} the assassination of MalcolmX. [...] "I may have been complicit in words that I spoke", he said. [...] "I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being." [...] A few days later Farrakhan denied that he [...] "ordered the assassination" [...] of MalcolmX, although he again acknowledged that he [...] "created the atmosphere that ultimately led to MalcolmX's assassination." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-December 2007, al-Zawahiri's spokespeople {{announced}} plans for an [...] "open interview" [...] {{on a handful of}} Islamic Web sites. The administrators of 4 known jihadist web sites have been authorized to collect and forward questions, [...] "unedited", they pledge, and [...] "regardless of whether they are in support of or are against" [...] al-Qaeda, which would be forwarded to al-Zawahiri on January 16. al-Zawahiri responded to the questions later in 2008; among <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were that al-Qaeda didn't kill innocents, and that al-Qaeda would move to target Israel [...] "after expelling the occupier from Iraq".|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{he must be}} awakened," [...] he announced, but in an undertone, as if {{afraid to}} do <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> must needs be done.|$|R
60|$|George Crofts felt {{as though}} he'd burst, and then 'e got his breath, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>'e</b> <b>said</b> about Uncle Joe was so awful that Mrs. Mitchell told the boys to go away.|$|R
60|$|Then Bob Pretty lost 'is temper, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>'e</b> <b>said</b> about Mr. Cutts wasn't fit for Smith to 'ear. He threw 'imself down at last {{full length}} {{on the ground}} and sulked till the day broke.|$|R
2500|$|As {{understood}} by Skinner, ascribing dignity to individuals involves giving them {{credit for their}} actions. To say [...] "Skinner is brilliant" [...] means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's determinist theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force {{and he had no}} choice in saying <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. J. E. R. Staddon (The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition, 2014) has argued the compatibilist position; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with All About Soap Richie revealed how Alfie reacts. He commented: [...] "It's {{the last thing he}} expected to hear. He didn't see it coming. He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury is still out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back... They do tend to come through these things, so who knows?" ...|$|E
60|$|I thought Rupert would ha' bust, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{to the man}} wot was {{spending}} money like water to rescue 'im was disgraceful.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Offence! What are {{you talking}} of? He didn't offend--No, but when I said I could not bring so many upon him, and could not have Owen teased about <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would bother me no more, that I had Owen, {{and did not want}} him. And then he walked off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The drill was 'ard an' 'eavy, [...] The sky was 'ot an' blue, [...] An' 'is eye {{was wild}} an' 'is 'air was wet, [...] But 'is {{sergeant}} pulled 'im through.

5000|$|One of <b>the</b> last <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Ray Sumby, his {{literary}} editor, was [...] "Ray, don't take on too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY (springing up again). Did Sir Howard {{tell you}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> about Captain Brassbound's mother? (Renewed sensation.) I told you they quarrelled, Captain Kearney. I said so, didn't I? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{made more}} fuss than Bill Chambers a'most, 'specially when they dropped 'im off a hurdle {{carrying}} him 'ome, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Dr. Green for rubbing his 'ands {{as he came}} into the bedroom was disgraceful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, your Majesty," [...] he said. [...] "I {{remember}} these streets before the Lord Provost began to rule us. I can't remember how we felt very well. All the great songs and the fighting change one so; and I don't {{think we can}} really estimate all we owe to the Provost; but I can remember his coming into this very shop twenty-two years ago, and I remember <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> The singular thing is that, as far as I remember, I thought <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> odd at that time. Now it's the things that I said, as far as I can recall them, that seem to me odd--as odd as a madman's antics." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hewet's {{thoughts}} {{had followed}} some such course as this, for <b>the</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{as they stood}} {{on the edge of}} the cliff was-- ...|$|R
60|$|But moments only, for <b>the</b> next <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{put her in}} a {{particularly}} odious light. He informed me that she had sworn to hunt Mr. Anon down.|$|R
6000|$|They danced the dance, and Frank acquitted himself respectably, but relapsed {{into his}} {{objectionable}} ways {{as soon as}} the trial ended; for <b>the</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with a sigh of relief, was,-- ...|$|R
60|$|What {{happened}} after that isn't to be written in a diary. I won't even write down <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> about how I looked, because it would seem so terribly vain, but I can't help thinking of them, for I am so happy.|$|E
60|$|When Carrier learnt of it <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{were less}} than ever fit for publication. He raved like a madman at the very thought that a quibbling lawyer should stand in the very path of him, the august {{representative}} of the Sacred People.|$|E
6000|$|Grubb arrived, riding hard. He was {{shouting}} something. He sprang off and threw his bicycle into the hedge. [...] "Don't throw water on it!" [...] he said--"don't throw water on it!" [...] He displayed commanding presence of mind. He became {{captain of the}} occasion. Others were glad to repeat <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and imitate his actions.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a fine}} night, the sky {{thick with}} stars, and Mr. Farebrother {{proposed}} that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road. <b>The</b> next <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>the</b> little <b>things,</b> his movement, <b>the</b> funny {{tones of}} his voice, that showed up big to Anna. <b>The</b> matter-of-fact <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were absurd in contrast. <b>The</b> <b>things</b> {{her father said}} seemed {{meaningless}} and neutral.|$|R
6000|$|We said no {{more about}} Heyst on that occasion, and it so {{happened}} that I did not meet Davidson again for some three months. When we did come together, almost <b>the</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was: ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Lamb was {{a little}} man and no good as a fighter, but <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Joe Barlcomb as he leaned out o' the winder and shook 'is fist at him was 'arder to bear than blows. He screamed away {{at the top of}} 'is voice for ten minutes, and then 'e pulled the winder to with a bang and went back to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{tell you}} {{no more of}} what he said to me," [...] she {{declared}} gravely; [...] "save that <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were fire of love and essence of beauty, and that he composed hulas to me, and sang them to me, before all, of nights under the stars as we lay on our mats at the feasting; and I on the Makaloa mat of Lilolilo.|$|E
60|$|That {{of course}} was a ridiculous dream, but it shows the state of mental {{excitement}} into which Mr. Bensington got and the real value he attached to his idea, much {{better than any of}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> or did when he was awake and on his guard. Or I should not have mentioned it, because as a general rule I do not think it is at all interesting for people to tell each other about their dreams.|$|E
6000|$|The men did {{not like}} Dr. Mitchell, {{and would not have}} him if possible. Yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor, they had to submit. <b>The</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to a sick or injured labourer, invariably, was: ...|$|R
6000|$|The next morning, while I was dressing, {{the steward}} of {{my side of}} the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted. But <b>the</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was--'Rather a bad job, sir--a {{passenger}} missing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear of that. <b>The</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when <b>he</b> {{could speak}} was 'Tell Rose carefully,' and as I came away he guessed where I was going {{and tried to}} kiss {{his hand in the}} old way, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|At this, {{to employ}} a metaphor, the {{champagne}} of the Head's wrath, which had been fermenting steadily during his late interview, {{got the better of}} the cork of self-control, and he exploded. If the Mutual Friend ever has grandchildren he will probably tell them with bated breath the story of how the Head paced the room, and the legend of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> But it will be some time before {{he will be able to}} speak about it with any freedom. At last there was a lull in the storm.|$|E
60|$|Toward Cornelia he behaved {{with the}} most scrupulous deference, even with delicacy, {{as if they had}} indeed met in former days, but {{as if she were a}} person of such dignity and {{consequence}} that their acquaintance could only have been of the most formal character. He did it so well, and seemed to take such a pleasure in doing it that she blushed for him. Some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to the others were so droll that she had to laugh at them. But he did not presume upon her tolerance.|$|E
60|$|It is {{hard work}} to make a speech when you have listened to {{compliments}} from the powers in authority. A compliment is a hard text to preach to. When the chairman introduces me as a person of merit, and when he says pleasant things about me, I always feel like answering simply that {{what he says is}} true; that it is all right; that, as far as I am concerned, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> can stand as they are. But you always have to say something, and that is what frightens me.|$|E
6000|$|The {{two girls}} {{had taken their}} walk, and were just going in, when, looking round, they saw Philip walking fast and determinedly up the approach, and as they turned back to meet him, <b>the</b> first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, 'Where is Guy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this crisis}} Lydgate was announced, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> first <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, [...] "I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse." [...] Dorothea's hand was of a marble coldness.|$|R
5000|$|While Tony lectures Vito Jr., {{he tells}} him he [...] "goes about in pity for himself", {{which was the}} phrase he became {{intrigued}} with while in the hospital, and <b>the</b> same <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Artie Bucco in the Season 6, Part I episode [...] "Luxury Lounge" ...|$|R
