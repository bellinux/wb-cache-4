500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E
2500|$|They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} be a trilogy. [...] What {{happened}} was that all of the people that made Streets of Fire left Universal Studios and went to 20th Century Fox. It was made at Universal, so they owned the rights to the story. [...] So it was left behind. I was told by Joel Silver that the sequel was {{going to be}} set in the snow, and the following film would be set in the desert.|$|E
2500|$|Ariel sighted the Bishop Light at 1:30 am on 5 September 1866. With all {{possible}} sail set, she sped toward {{the mouth of}} the English Channel. At daybreak, another ship was seen on the starboard quarter, also carrying every stitch of canvas that she could. Captain Keay of Ariel later said [...] "Instinct <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the Taeping" [...] - and he was right. A strong west-southwesterly wind carried these two ships up the channel at 14 knots. The Lizard was abeam at 8:00 am and Start Point at noon. The two ships were off Portland towards 6:00 pm and St. Catherine's Point was due north at 7:25 pm. Beachy Head was abeam just after midnight. The relative positions of the two ships barely shifted all this while - Ariel kept her lead.|$|E

60|$|Again, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{has become}} the custom in large {{businesses}} of which the dividends are falling, {{to put in a}} man called an 'Organizer,' who is often an American.|$|R
60|$|Something in the {{atmosphere}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not only Rupert and I who were listening with intensity to this statement.|$|E
60|$|It {{had seemed}} to me but a little time that I had been away, and yet the boatman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hours.|$|E
60|$|VALIANT. Why, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{dangerous}} way; yea, {{the most dangerous}} way in the world, said they, is that which the pilgrims go.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} very much pleased," [...] she continued. [...] "We have little money and father is not very strong. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had taken a weight off his mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she will. She has {{not merely}} art, consummate art-instinct, in her, {{but she has}} {{personality}} also; and you have often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is personalities, not principles, that move the age." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we were friends. I {{always liked}} him. I {{used not to}} know what to think about him. Miss Anne Prettyman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be so; and once before I thought so myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I made enquiry about it, sir, and the {{boatswain}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a {{fight between}} two of the boys. Of course he had not been present.” ...|$|E
6000|$|VALIANT. Why, they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{dangerous}} way: [...] "Yea, {{the most dangerous}} way in the world," [...] said they, [...] "is that which the pilgrims go." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{repeated}} to {{her word}} for word what the Zulus had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Pereira, whose object {{seems to have been}} to bring about my death or capture.|$|E
6000|$|... “To {{be exact}} you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> weighed just under two pounds, but I {{took into account}} the fact that {{abnormal}} vegetables and freshwater fish have an after-life, in which growth is not arrested.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{time will}} come, I've no doubt," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Gibson. [...] "Everybody has always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be so. Even her oldest friends knew it. You ask Mrs. MacHugh, or Mrs. French, at Heavitree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was given}} in token of service, {{rendered}} by me and my squire here, to Glendower's daughter. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be of service if, at any time, I were taken prisoner by her father's followers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{poor little}} feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because I didn't {{want to wake}} up Geordie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bell <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be so," [...] said Mrs Dale. [...] "But I {{could hardly}} bring myself {{at first to}} think that he was good enough for my darling." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{brief moment}} in which we might have {{softened}} towards each other was over. There was a glitter in her blue eyes which <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> once more war between us.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked up}} quickly, evidently {{surprised}} at my being there. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not--suitable <b>that</b> I {{should be with}} {{you as much as}} I have been since we came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To me," [...] {{he replied}} in English, [...] "it {{is of no}} consequence. I speak English most. I presume, from what Karl there has <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is your {{intention}} {{to go into the}} restaurant business in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would hurt}} his self-respect {{that any other}} man should find the money for such an object, and that {{though he was a}} poor man himself he would devote his last penny to {{removing}} the obstacles which divided us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{have still}} some {{distance}} to travel this evening, and must not drink more,' I observed, for prudence <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dangerous work for two sober country lads {{to keep pace}} with an experienced toper.|$|E
6000|$|... "This was {{the first}} time that Matthias had ever spoken to me about Judith, and I knew just as well as if he had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Dorcas Stone's clothes that had got him into that way of thinking.|$|E
60|$|This done, I {{made the}} best of my way out of the town again, and roamed the lonely moorland country which {{surrounds}} Frizinghall, until my watch <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time, at last, to return to Mr. Candy's house.|$|E
6000|$|... "You always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is easy {{to drive}} a coach and four through wills and {{settlements}} and legal things. If he is so anxious to do so, can he not {{find a way out}} of the difficulty--I mean, some honourable way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{have to do}} it, as I did," [...] Mortimer Gazebee {{had said}} to him; [...] "I didn't like {{it because of the}} family, but Lady Amelia <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be so." [...] Whereupon Crosbie took the advice of Mortimer Gazebee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{tell me what}} he said. He said, that if I died--what then? You {{must not}} be afraid of {{speaking}} of it openly. Why, Margaret, they have all <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be {{in a month or}} two. What did Rubb say?" ...|$|R
60|$|Although {{the boy had}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> but {{ten feet}} to the floor below I {{experienced}} the same thrills as though I were hanging above a bottomless pit. Then I released my hold and dropped--four feet to a soft cushion of sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure I am {{very much}} obliged," [...] the lady answered. [...] "If I {{had known it}} {{was as far as}} this, I'd have waited till I could have found a carriage. The porter at the station <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I like it. I never smoked {{till after}} I got that hurt from the dog, but {{not being able}} to do things like other fellows, I took to smoking. I like it, and the doctor <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a capital {{preventive}} against fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is hard to}} say. There are men who by {{no means}} wear their hearts upon their sleeves, and my husband is one of them. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be unbecoming in him to refuse, {{and that was all}} he said to me about it." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{young fellow}} about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with leather cords and gaiters. He lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a terrible cut upon his head. He was insensible, but alive. A glance at his wound <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had not {{penetrated}} the bone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Heavens!" [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "they never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> is dreadfully sad. God help you, my poor child! There is nothing more to say except {{that he was only}} one among three hundred who have gone with him. Be brave now, before all these people. Look--here comes the tug." ...|$|R
