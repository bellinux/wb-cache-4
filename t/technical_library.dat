2500|$|Jiří Drahoš, former President of the Czech Academy of Sciences, {{announced}} his candidacy on 28 March 2017. Drahoš {{does not want}} to be the official candidate of any party, but some party leaders expressed their intention to support him. Petr Gazdík, the leader of Mayors and Independents, said that he sees Drahoš as a great candidate and rival to Miloš Zeman, and believes he can convince his party to support Drahoš. The leaders of TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL also said they were considering supporting him. ODS leader Petr Fiala refused to comment on Drahoš's candidacy but acknowledged him to be a dignified candidate. Leader of ANO 2011 Andrej Babiš said that he considers Drahoš a respectable person but noted that Drahoš does not want the support of any party. In response to the announcement, Zeman's spokesman Jiří Ovčáček described Drahoš as just [...] "a product of PR". He added that in his view the Czech Republic needs [...] "a president who will stand by people in situations such as the migration crisis", not just [...] "a yes man who can deliver empty speeches". Michal Horáček said that Drahoš would be a candidate of political parties and will have to return their support. Drahoš met journalists at the National <b>Technical</b> <b>Library</b> on 30 March 2017. He said that he is an independent candidate who supports European Union and NATO. He also said that he would reject a government that included the Communist Party. He plans to gather 50,000 signatures instead of being nominated by lawmakers.|$|E
