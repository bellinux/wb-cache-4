25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to agree {{in at least one}} point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E
500|$|Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine {{and colleagues}} {{compared}} Jeanne Calment {{with a list}} of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. [...] "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E

2500|$|Sunday {{school and}} Bible study classes were conducted, with various {{religious}} denominations {{making use of}} the main hall for their services in sequence. De facto leader of the community Warren Chase emphasized the religious harmony {{of members of the}} phalanx, noting in a letter that [...] "although we have many members of different religious societies, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> determined to lay aside metaphysical differences, and make a united social effort, founded on the fundamental principles of religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fifth season {{once again}} {{received}} mostly positive critical reception. Season 5 {{was given a}} weighted average of 78 out of 100 by Metacritic. Variety said that [...] "The ABC series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts, and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks, flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer {{not to think about}} them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, when <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way. This finale was entertaining as all get-out to me, and despite the occasional groaner moment, I think this may be Lost's most purposeful, surprising finale." ...|$|E

60|$|Captain Benwick {{was most}} considerately {{attentive}} to her; and, united as <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even {{in thinking that}} it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all of them, Gran'pa Jim, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to {{have been}} 'passed by the Board of Censors'--perhaps when their eyes were shut.
