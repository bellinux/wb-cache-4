5|$|The killings {{helped to}} spur {{the passage of}} a new Maryland state law {{pertaining}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the mentally ill, which went into effect on October 1, 2003. The law's creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from Logan's parents, James Logan, Sr. and Karen Logan. The law allows a judge to order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person, if the person presented a threat to themselves or to others.|$|E

These operations, conducted by Wehrmacht troops as well as SS, were bloody, although not unusual by German Eastern Front standards. In conjunction with the ruthless scorched earth policies he followed during his retreats, they {{would lead to the}} Soviet Union's declaring him a war criminal.|$|E
5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta {{and other}} Africans in London; {{he became the}} honorary {{secretary}} of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia's monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> Jews in Nazi Germany. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Matthews {{said in a}} 2006 Alien Experience {{interview}} that he {{had moved to the}} United Kingdom due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> his fellow Vietnam War veterans and was acting in The American Way when Cameron offered him the role of Apone. Using his military experience, Matthews consulted with the film crew and helped direct the actors playing Colonial Marines. According to fellow Aliens actor Daniel Kash, Matthews improvised much of his performance and based it on his Vietnam War experience. His performance influenced the military science fiction subgenre, with the charismatic black commander inspiring the character of Sergeant Avery Johnson in the Halo video-game franchise.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth rewrote the sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb rewrote the section on the Slavonic version; James W. Bright rewrote the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|E

5|$|Practitioners of Falun Gong have {{launched}} {{a number of}} other campaigns to bring attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> Falun Gong in China. Notable examples include the Human Rights Torch Relay, which toured to over 35 countries in 2007 and 2008 ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The relay was intended to draw attention to a range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially those related to Falun Gong and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, human rights groups and other concerned organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Pieds-Noirs dwarfed that of the Muslim harkis who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War. Of {{approximately}} 250,000 Muslim loyalists only about 90,000, including dependents, were able to escape to France; and of those who remained many thousands were killed by lynch mobs or executed as traitors by the FLN. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the European Pieds-Noirs, little effort {{was made by the}} French government to extend protection to the harkis or to arrange their organised evacuation.|$|E

Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E
