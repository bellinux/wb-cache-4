40|$|Abstract Background <b>Thymostimulin</b> is a thymic peptide {{fraction}} with immune-mediated cytotoxicity against {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC) in vitro and palliative efficacy in advanced HCC in two independent phase II trials. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the efficacy of <b>thymostimulin</b> in a phase III trial. Methods The study was designed as a prospective randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical phase III trial. Between 10 / 2002 and 03 / 2005, 135 patients with locally advanced or metastasised HCC (Karnofsky ≥ 60 %/Child-Pugh ≤ 12) were randomised to receive <b>thymostimulin</b> 75 mg s. c. 5 ×/week or placebo stratified according to liver function. Primary endpoint was twelve-month survival, secondary endpoints overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), tumor response, safety and quality of life. A subgroup analysis according to liver function, KPS and tumor stage (Okuda, CLIP and BCLC) formed part of the protocol. Results Twelve-month survival was 28 % [95 %CI 17 - 41; treatment] and 32 % [95 %CI 19 - 44; control] with no significant differences in median OS (5. 0 [95 % CI 3. 7 - 6. 3] vs. 5. 2 [95 % CI 3. 5 - 6. 9] months; p = 0. 87, HR = 1. 04 [95 % CI 0. 7 - 1. 6]) or TTP (5. 3 [95 %CI 2. 0 - 8. 6] vs. 2. 9 [95 %CI 2. 6 - 3. 1] months; p = 0. 60, HR = 1. 13 [95 % CI 0. 7 - 1. 8]). Adjustment for liver function, Karnofsky status or tumor stage did not affect results. While quality of life was similar in both groups, fewer patients on <b>thymostimulin</b> suffered from accumulating ascites and renal failure. Conclusions In our phase III trial, we found no evidence of any benefit to <b>thymostimulin</b> in the treatment of advanced HCC and there is therefore no justification for its use as single-agent treatment. The effect of <b>thymostimulin</b> on hepato-renal function requires further confirmation. Trial Registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 64487365. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} hymostimulin on chemotherapy-induced {{toxicity}} and long-term survival were studied in 26 evaluable patients with small cell lung cancer. Patients were randomly treated with six cycles of two alternating regimens (cyclophosphamide, 4 '-epidoxorubicin, and etoposide; cisplatin and etoposide), with (n = 15) or without (n = 11) <b>thymostimulin</b> (1 mg/Kg i. m., days 7 - 14 of every cycle). Only complete responders received maintenance treatment, consisting of <b>thymostimulin</b> administered 1 mg/Kg i. m., twice weekly, until tumor relapse. Myelosuppression, fever and documented infectious episodes {{were significantly less}} severe in thymostimulin-treated patients, allowing the administration of significantly higher drug doses at shorter intervals between chemotherapy cycles; a significant improvement in complete response rate and survival were also observed.

40|$|A {{randomised}} controlled {{trial of}} thymic hormone extracts (<b>Thymostimulin)</b> (1 mg/kg/day for seven days; 1 mg/kg/weekly thereafter) was undertaken in 30 patients (21 women, nine men) with treated, apparently inactive 'autoimmune' chronic active hepatitis during withdrawal of maintenance corticosteroid and azathioprine therapy. Reactivation of disease occurred in 26 patients (86 %) during or after treatment withdrawal and was as frequent in the <b>Thymostimulin</b> treated (11 of 13; 84 %) and untreated (15 of 17; 88 %; p greater than 0. 05) groups. Reactivation of disease {{was accompanied by a}} severe defect in concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity, the magnitude of which was similar in the <b>Thymostimulin</b> treated and untreated groups (mean % suppression = 16. 4 and 3. 2 respectively; p greater than 0. 05 vs 84. 4 in control subjects).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Thymostimulin</b> is a thymic peptide {{fraction}} with immune-mediated cytotoxicity against {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} in vitro.

Primary endpoint was overall survival, secondary endpoint tumor response or progression-free survival. A multivariate Cox's regression model was used to identify variables affecting survival. Results Median survival was 11. 5 months (95 % CI 7. 9 – 15. 0) with a 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year survival of 50 %, 23 % and 9 %.

40|$|The immunodepressive {{effect of}} {{surgical}} procedures is well known. Immunotherapy with thymic hormones has used {{a long time}} to prevent surgical immunitary damage. In cardiac surgery, we can observe a hard immunitary depression caused by the cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP). In this paper we evaluate the response to immunotherapy, with an extractive thymic hormone: <b>thymostimulin</b> at the dosage of 1 mg/kg/day; 20 patients of a group of 40 underwent CBP. Immunological monitoring was obtained with the "multitest CMI", a disposable skin test to evaluate changes of lymphocytes, especially T cells.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the humoral primary and {{secondary}} response to tetanus toxoid (TT), and to define the possible immunopotentiating effect of the thymic hormone <b>thymostimulin,</b> we studied 13 elderly people, selected according to the Senieur Eurage protocol, vaccinated against TT, an antigen never encountered before. Six of them were treated with <b>thymostimulin</b> {{before and during the}} immunization protocol. Specific anti-TT antibody level measurement and spectrotypic analysis were performed on the sera collected from the subjects at different times over the immunization protocol. In addition, spontaneous in vitro production of anti-TT antibodies as well as cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity reactions were also studied. Only one patient showed a detectable humoral immune response after the first immunization. After the booster, four of six thymostimulin-treated individuals, compared with only two of seven controls, showed in vivo anti-TT humoral response; at the same time, spontaneous anti- TT production was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five of six thymostimulin-treated individuals but only three of seven untreated controls. These differences were highly significant (p < 0. 0001). In addition, only in thymostimulin-treated subjects were the levels of serum anti- TT antibodies 14, 21 and 28 days after the booster significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than the baseline values. The spectrotypic analysis of anti-TT antibodies performed by isoelectric focusing and reverse blotting showed total agreement with the' results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cutaneous testing to recall antigens showed that among the thymostimulin-treated subjects four of six converted from negative to positive cutaneous reactions (only one to TT antigen). These four were also responders for anti-TT antibodies. In the control group, only one patient converted from cutaneous negativity to positivity for one antigen other than TT (p < 0. 0001). This observation suggests that the immunopotentiating effect of <b>thymostimulin</b> is via the T-helper network. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the adjuvant effect of <b>thymostimulin</b> in the specific T-cell dependent antibody response and emphasizes the necessity to consider a cycle of treatment with immunostimulants in elderly people undergoing specific vaccinations, and the importance of the search for biological adjuvants in the construction of new vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{hepatitis}} B virus-associated membranous nephropathy with adenine arabinoside and thymic extract. Previously {{we found that}} corticosteroid treatment in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) -associated membranous nephropathy (HBVMN) {{was not associated with}} a favorable outcome. To distinguish the differences of the HBV DNA in macrophage, T and B cells among HBVMN patients with or without corticosteroid treatment, serial studies at different time points were investigated. HBV DNA appeared as an “episomal” molecule as with 3. 2 kb in macrophage, T and B cells. This molecule disappeared after 12 months among HBVMN patients without corticosteroid treatment. HBV DNA, by contrast, appeared as episomal form even three years later in T cells, with frequent proteinuria among HBVMN patients with corticosteroid treatment. This finding indicates that the use of corticosteroids leads to a potential risk of enhancing HBV viral replication in T cells. We studied 24 HBVMN patients who had previously received corticosteroid treatment and had persistent proteinuria, who were administered combination therapy with adenine arabinoside for two weeks and thymic extract (<b>Thymostimulin)</b> for six months to decrease urine protein loss and obtain seroconversion. These 24 patients had heavy (22 of 24, 91. 6 %) or mild (2 of 24, 8. 4 %) proteinuria prior to adenine arabinoside and <b>thymostimulin</b> treatment. All 24 patients demonstrated HBV DNA in mononuclear cells and simultaneously exhibited sera positive with HBsAg and HBeAg. In contrast, after treatment only one case (4. 2 %) had heavy and two cases (8. 4 %) mild proteinuria; HBV DNA was demonstrated in macrophage (4 of 24, 16. 7 %), T cells (9 of 24, 37. 5 %), and B cells (6 of 24, 25 %) as well as serum (24 of 24, 100 %) prior to treatment. The decreases to 16. 7 %, 37. 5 %, 25 % and 41. 6 % in the macrophage, T cell, B cell, and serum respectively, were statistically significant (P< 0. 01) in each instance. In addition, six cases with complete remission of proteinuria changed their hepatitis B markers. Four cases (16. 7 %) changed from HBe (+) /anti-HBe (-) to HBe (-) /anti-HBe (-). These results suggest that combination therapy of adenine arabinoside and <b>Thymostimulin</b> in HBVMN patients is more effective in the improvement of proteinuria than corticosteroid treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this report, we have {{evaluated}} the immunological effects following administration of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) {{in combination with}} <b>thymostimulin</b> (TP- 1), {{as well as of}} IFN-alpha and TP- 1 alone in patients with neoplasias who underwent surgery and were subsequently treated with conventional chemotherapy. Data suggest that the combination of IFN-alpha and TP- 1 is the most effective in the up-regulation of some immune parameters such as the CD 4 (+) -CD 8 + cell-dependent antibacterial activity. Since this immune function {{plays an important role in}} the host protection against different targets such as invading microorganisms and/or neoplastic cells, the administration of TP- 1 -IFN-alpha is advisable for patients with neoplasias under chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with head}} and neck {{carcinoma}} show deficits of cellular immunity, probably due to low molecular mass factors (LMMFs) released by the tumour. <b>Thymostimulin</b> (TP 1) restores the defective monocyte chemotaxis and dendritic cell clustering capability {{in the presence of}} the tumour when administered pre-operatively. In the present study we investigated these immune parameters in 39 patients treated with TP 1 for 10 days pre- and 6 months post-operatively and in 22 patients who were not treated with TP 1 for 6 months after operation. Removal of the tumour in non-TP 1 -treated patients also resulted in a restoration of monocyte and dendritic cell functions, while TP 1 treatment gave no additional effect. LMMF levels in the blood of both TP 1 -treated and non-TP 1 -treated patients remained elevated even after removal of the tumour, and it is therefore concluded that it is unlikely that depression of cellular immunity is a direct effect of these LMMF...|$|E
40|$|Experience with 54 {{patients}} {{affected by}} pulmonary carcinoma treated or not with surgery and undergoing <b>thymostimulin</b> administration during long-term follow-up (70 mg i. m. {{every other day}} for 3 months), is reported. Drug intolerance was observed in 5. 5 % of cases. In patients {{who were able to}} complete the therapeutic cycle (50 cases) objective improvement of Performance Status was obtained in 46 % of cases and subjective improvement in nearly 90 %. The course of neoplastic disease showed definite progression (presence of local recurrence or distant metastasis) in 20 % of cases, remission in 6 %. No case of onset of pulmonary or extrapulmonary infections was observed. After treatment, a significant increase (between 24 % and 108 %) in blood parameters (circulation lymphocytes, CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 16, IgG, IgA, IgM) was observed in 28 - 56 % of cases. As for CD 4 increase, this was accompanied by concomitantly positive Merieaux test in 44. 5 % of cases. Quiescence or complete remission has appeared to occur together with high CD 16 values, progression with high CD 8 and low CD 16 values...|$|E
40|$|T {{lymphocyte}}s, T lymphocyte subpopulations {{and delayed}} hypersensitivity reactions to recall antigens were studied in 20 aged subjects clinically unaffected by disorders {{of the immune}} system. T-cells evaluated by the sheep rosette test and absolute T-cell number were within normal range. T-cell subsets were studied by the high affinity rosetting test and by the sheep rosette test after pre-incubation with theophylline; such methods have been shown by others to discriminate between T-cells with helper or suppressor activity. We did not observe an imbalance of such subpopulations. Skin reactivity to recall antigens (Candida and SK-SD) was depressed in several cases. Since a decline in serum levels of thymic hormones {{has been reported in}} the ageing and it is suggested that this could account for the T-dependent immunity defect, we treated these patients with a bovine thymic extract (<b>thymostimulin,</b> TP- 1) 1 mg/kg/day for three consecutive days. Immunological tests were performed again after this therapy but no modifications were observed. We may conclude that the aged subjects studied in this paper present normal relative and absolute number of T-cells and T subpopulations, whereas the function of T-cells, as assessed by skin reactivity to recall antigens is often depressed. Short term therapy with TP- 1 at the above-mentioned dosage was ineffective in modifying the parameters analysed...|$|E
40|$|Background Purified thymus {{extracts}} (pTE) {{and synthetic}} thymic peptides (sTP) {{are thought to}} enhance the immune system of cancer patients in order to fight the growth of tumour cells and to resist infections due to immunosuppression induced by the disease and antineoplastic therapy. Objectives To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} pTE and sTP for the management of cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, BIOETHICSLINE, BIOSIS, CATLINE, CISCOM, HEALTHSTAR, HTA, SOMED and LILACS (to February 2010). Selection criteria Randomised trials of pTE or sTP in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, compared to the same regimen with placebo or no additional treatment in adult cancer patients. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from published trials. We derived odds ratios (OR) from overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates, tumour response (TR) rates, and rates of adverse effects (AE) related to antineoplastic treatments. We used a random-effects model for meta-analysis. Main results We identified 26 trials (2736 patients). Twenty trials investigated pTE (<b>thymostimulin</b> or thymosin fraction 5) and six trials investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin α 1). Twenty-one trials reported results for OS, six for DFS, 14 for TR, nine for AE and 10 for safety of pTE and sTP. Addition of pTE conferred no benefit on OS (RR 1. 00, 95...|$|E
40|$|The ultrastructural changes {{occurring}} in the medullary epithelium of the thymus of young mice, {{as a result of}} repeated injections of thymic extract, TP- 1 (<b>thymostimulin)</b> was investigated. After daily injection of TP- 1 for 3 weeks, no changes in thymus architecture could be observed by light microscopy. However, by electron microscopy, specific changes were noticed in the epithelial cells. The secretory granules became dilated and engorged; diameter of granules in normal control thymus was approximately 200 - 250 nm, but reached 1000 nm in treated mice. Degenerative changes appeared in some of these granules, including myelin bodies, distorted configuration and fat droplets. Signs of involution of whole cells and presence of cellular debri within macrophages were observed. Acid phosphatase staining disclosed many lysosomes containing ingested granules. No such findings were observed in control untreated mice, or in mice treated by a heart extract similarly prepared to TP- 1. All these findings can be taken as ultrastructural evidence for feedback inhibition of thymic secretory activity, in analogy to the changes occurring other feedback inhibited, peptide hormone secreting glands. The data indicate that (i) the thymus respond to feedback inhibitory stimuli, as other endocrine glands do; (ii) TP- 1, the thymic extract under study, contains a physiologically significant thymic hormone, which, when introduced in high doses can exert specific feedback inhibition. This can be taken as an additional, new criterion for the definition of thymic hormones...|$|E
40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma patients have been characterized by impairments in their cell-mediated immune system, particularly by decreased chemotactic function of monocytes and impairments in {{the function of the}} monocyte-derived dendritic cells (viz, a decreased capability to form cell "clusters"). These impairments are thought to be due to immunosuppressive factors of low molecular mass released by tumor, the so-called p 15 E-like factors. These suppressive effects of p 15 -like factors can be neutralized in vitro by thymic peptides, such as <b>thymostimulin</b> (TP 1). In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in the Netherlands, 41 patients with operable head and neck {{squamous cell carcinoma}}s (HNSCC) were treated for 10 days prior to surgery with intramuscular TP 1 in one of three dosages (0. 5 mg/kg; 1. 0 mg/kg or 2. 0 mg/kg body weight) or treated with placebo. Assessment of monocyte chemotaxis, the capability of dendritic cells to form clusters and the presence of p 15 E-like low-molecular-mass factors (LMMFs) in serum was performed before TP 1 treatment and on the day of surgery. Findings demonstrated that TP 1 in a dose of 1. 0 mg/kg and 2. 0 mg/kg resulted in normalization of impaired monocyte chemotactic capability. Although the cluster capability of dendritic cells after TP 1 treatment improved, values only reached statistical significance for the 0. 5 mg/kg group. Serum p 15 E-like LMMF levels were not affected by TP 1 treatment in any of the patient groups. Contrary to expectations we found no correlation between elevated immunosuppressive LMMFs and defective monocyte chemotaxis or cluster capability of dendritic cells. We conclude that treatment with TP 1 can improve monocyte chemotaxis in HNSCC patients but an effect on the production of p 15 E-like factors by carcinoma cells could not be demonstrate...|$|E

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on apparent beneficial treatment regimens as induction or maintenance treatment in AIH were included. Pediatric studies were excluded. We calculated relative risks (RR) for comparison of treatment options on the primary outcome measure, which was defined as clinical, biochemical and histological remission.

The remaining 4 studies (n= 162) assessed maintenance therapy. All but one maintenance study (<b>thymostimulin</b> versus no therapy) studied predniso(lo) ne (PRED), azathioprine (AZA) or combination PRED+AZA. We found no differences in primary outcome between induction therapy with PRED and PRED+AZA in treatment naive patients (RR= 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 65 – 1. 47). AZA monotherapy as induction was considered as not viable because of a high mortality rate (30 %). This was similar in AIH patients who relapsed: RR for PRED versus PRED+AZA for inducing remission was not different: 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 37 – 1. 39). PRED+AZA maintained remission more often than PRED (RR= 1. 40; 95 % CI 1. 13 – 1. 73). Also AZA maintained a higher remission rate than PRED (RR= 1. 35; 95 % CI 1. 07 – 1. 70).

40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) produces immunosuppressive low-molecular-mass factors (LMMFs) responsible for defects in the cell-mediated immune system. These defects include impaired monocyte chemotaxis and an impaired capability of dendritic cells (DC) to form cellular clusters. It has been shown previously that the immunomodulating drug <b>thymostimulin</b> (TP 1) restores these defects in vitro. An immunohistochemical study was performed on tumors of 18 patients with HNSCC who had preoperatively been treated with TP 1 {{in one of three}} dosages (0. 5 mg/kg, 1. 0 mg/kg, 2. 0 mg/kg body weight). Additionally, tumors of 4 patients who had been treated with a placebo and 12 patients who had not received any preoperative treatment were studied. A relative surface area of infiltration, meaning the percentage of stromal or epithelial tissue covered by infiltrating cells in histological sections, was calculated using an image analysis system (VIDAS RT) for CD 3 + T-cells, CD 14 +/CD 68 + monocytes/macrophages and L 25 +/CD 1 a+ dendritic cells for each tumor. A highly significant, denser T-cell infiltration into the stromal tissue area of tumors of patients who had been treated with TP 1 when compared with tumors of non-TP 1 -treated patients was observed for all three dosages. None of the other tumor-infiltrating cell types was affected by TP 1. In addition, a correlation was found between the tumor T-cell infiltration and capability of DCs in the peripheral blood to form clusters with T-cells. No correlation existed between CD 3 + T-cell numbers in peripheral blood and T-cell infiltration into the tumor; nor were monocyte chemotactic functions in peripheral blood correlated with tumor infiltration by monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs. Preoperative treatment of HNSCC patients with TP 1 appears to strongly enhance tumor [...] T-cell infiltration. The number of tumor-infiltrating DCs was not affected by TP 1, but a positive correlation between tumor [...] T-cell infiltration and DC clustering capability suggests that the functional status of DCs is important in improved cell-mediated immunit...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{efficacy}} and safety of <b>thymostimulin</b> (TS) administered in addition to conventional chemotherapy in patients with intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (IG, HG-NHL). A total of 150 patients with newly diagnosed IG- or HG-NHL were entered in a multicenter trial to compare the effectiveness of two different third-generation regimens (MACOP-B versus ProMACE-CytaBOM) and were randomized to receive chemotherapy (CT) alone or CT + TS. In both regimens doxorubicin was replaced by a 20 % higher dose of epidoxorubicin. TS was administered i. m. at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily on days 22 - 28 of each drug course to patients treated with ProMACE-CytaBOM, and on days 22 - 29, 50 - 57, and 77 - 85 to patients treated with MACOP-B. There were 134 fully evaluable patients: 68 treated with CT alone and 66 treated with CT + TS. Patients treated with CT + TS had a higher complete remission (CR) rate compared to patients given CT alone (59. 1 % vs 42. 4 %; P =. 05). CR were significantly higher for patients treated with CT + TS in the groups with IG-NHL (P =. 01), in those aged less than 60 years (P =. 05), with good performance status (P =. 05), and normal hemoglobin levels (P =. 05). Four-year survival rates are 64. 5 % for patients treated with CT + TS and 43. 0 % for those treated with CT alone (P =. 30). No difference between the two treatment arms have been observed as regards drug-related toxicity and the number and severity of infectious episodes. The use of TS during the 7 days before chemotherapy has been associated with a significantly superior CR rate. The advantage of CT + TS was mostly obtained in patients with IG-NHL, and those with good performance status or normal hemoglobin levels. In these patients TS may have potentiated the host reactions against the tumor, leading to an increase in NK activity and the production of cytokines. This postulated increase in the effectiveness of chemotherapy after TS might also explain the absence of the expected myeloprotective action...|$|E
