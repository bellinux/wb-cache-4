40|$|ABSTRACT: Under a DARPA {{contract}} ITN {{has developed}} solid-state thin-film rechargeable batteries on fiber substrates for energy and power storage in novel stand-alone <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery</b> applications, power composites, and electrotextiles. The basic solid-state thin-film rechargeable battery technology was first invented at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN, USA, in the ‘ 90 s and since 2000 {{has been taken}} to next level by ITN with the invention of PowerFibers, which were first demonstrated in early 2001. The basic concept of PowerFibers is to marry power/energy properties with mechanical properties while making the thin-film batteries {{become a part of}} and take over some functions of the load-bearing mechanical structure. This novel design reduces the mass and volume fraction of the parasitic, non-power supplying, strictly mechanical parts in applications where those dimensions are critical. In addition to this basic concept, PowerFibers provide a unique form factor, defined by a large length-to-diameter ratio, which permits small bending radii and substantial flexing. Such mechanical properties are prerequisites for potentially using PowerFibers in novel <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery</b> applications. An advantage of PowerFibers over flat flexible thin-film batteries fabricated on foil substrate is the inherently larger surface area of PowerFibers, which in turn is proportional to the power and energy of a given type of <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery.</b> Thus, for example, a <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery</b> fabricated on a 50 µm thick foil substrate of 1 cm x 1 cm area has...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of small aircraft including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and micro air vehicles (MAVs) has gained tremendous {{interest in the}} research community. One particular area of interest involves creating innovative techniques to increase the flight time or endurance of UAVs and MAVs. Energy harvesting technology presents a potential solution {{for the improvement of}} flight times by converting ambient energy into electrical energy {{that can be used to}} power the aircraft. Adding the necessary components to perform energy harvesting can, however, add a significant amount of mass to the aircraft, which often have small payload capacities. The additional mass can hinder the performance of the aircraft and, in fact, result in a decreased overall endurance. A novel concept is presented in this paper involving the combination of piezoelectric devices and new <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery</b> technology to form multifunctional self-charging, load-bearing energy harvesting devices for use in UAV systems. The proposed self-charging structures contain both power generation and energy storage capabilities in a multilayered, composite platform consisting of active piezoceramic layers for scavenging energy, <b>thin-film</b> <b>battery</b> layers for storing scavenged energy, and a central metallic substrate layer. The compact nature of the devices allows easier integration into UAV systems and their flexibility provides the ability to carry load as structural members.

This paper addresses several aspects of the development and experimental evaluation of the proposed self-charging structures. Details of the design and fabrication of the self-charging structures and appropriate energy harvesting circuitry are given.

40|$|The {{combination}} of solid ceramic-like electrolytes with inorganic electrodes, thus creating an all solid-state battery, requires a sophisticated co-processing, {{taking into account}} different chemical and thermal stability of the applied materials. <b>Thin-film</b> <b>batteries</b> allow – {{on the one hand}} – a detailed analysis of the compatibility of active storage material and the electrolyte because of well-defined interfaces. On the other hand, <b>thin-film</b> <b>batteries</b> also have the potential for energy storage solutions in applications with short-term or low power consumption. Optionally, a stacking of active thin layers can increase the energy content. In general, the deposition of a functional layer for solid-state battery cells requires a heat incidence that can lead to an undesired and detrimental diffusion of constituents into the substrate or into adjacent layers, to mechanical stresses and resulting cracks due to different coefficients of thermal expansion, or even to a decomposition of parts of the battery.

Analysis was done, among others, by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, optical emission spectroscopy, nuclear reaction analysis, Rutherford backscattering, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements and cyclic voltammetry.
