500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Gil Green. In an interview with MTV News, Diddy explained the video, stating, [...] " [...] is really about me being {{in a relationship with}} a young lady and you're constantly loving this person, and hoping that this day comes where they change and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> back." [...] Additionally, Green said that the video shows [...] "moments of him and his love but you can tell there's an emotional distance". The video was premiered on BET's 106 & Park on October 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrical themes explore [...] "hate, {{ignorance and}} sexism", and AllMusic noted its feminist lyrics. According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> so much, and they put you up on a pedestal and make you feel great, then they {{turn around and say}} 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] was inspired by a serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E

"For the first," [...] he answered, [...] "I do {{not think}} that they stand in our path, for <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> and wish you to be happy, {{although}} it is true that I, who am but a wanderer picked up upon the veldt, have no fortune to offer you--still fortune can be won," [...] he added doggedly.|$|E

Consider all these helpless folk--the little children, the young girls, {{the old and}} the feeble. Their creed is themselves. As well ask the leaves to change the twigs on which they grow. They could not change. At most you could but hope to turn them from honest folk into hypocrites. And why should you do it? They honour you. <b>They</b> <b>love</b> <b>you.</b> They harm none. They are proud to serve in your armies, to fight for you, to work for you, to build up the greatness of your kingdom. I implore you, sire, to think again before you sign an order which will bring misery and desolation to so many." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh well--who knows. If England were ruined--" [...] a slow {{smile of}} {{anticipation}} spread over his face. How he would love it--how {{they would all}} love it, if England were ruined. That is, the business part of them, perhaps, would not love it. But the human part would. The human part fairly licks its lips {{at the thought of}} England's ruin. The commercial part, however, quite violently disclaims the anticipations of the human part. And there it is. The newspapers chiefly speak with the commercial voice. But individually, when you are got at in a railway carriage or as now on a ship, up speaks the human voice, and you know how <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you.</b> This is no doubt inevitable. When the exchange stands at a hundred and six men go humanly blind, I suppose, however much they may keep the commercial eye open. And having gone humanly blind they bump into one's human self nastily: a nasty jar. You know then how they hate you. Underneath, they hate us, and as human beings we are objects of envy and malice. They hate us, with envy, and despise us, with jealousy. Which perhaps doesn't hurt commercially. Humanly it is to me unpleasant.|$|E

I--oh, I went through it all. But I broke the shafts and smashed the matrimonial cart, I can tell you, and I didn't care whether I smashed her up along with it or not. I didn't care one single bit, I assure you.--And here I am. And she is dead and buried these dozen years. Well--well! Life, you know, life. And women oh, they are the very hottest hell once they get the start of you. There's NOTHING they won't do to you, once they've got you. Nothing they won't do to you. Especially if <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you.</b> Then {{you may as well}} give up the ghost: or smash the cart behind you, and her in it. Otherwise she will just harry you into submission, and make a dog of you, and cuckold you under your nose. And you'll submit. Oh, you'll submit, and go on calling her my darling. Or else, if you won't submit, she'll do for you. Your only chance is to smash the shafts, and the whole matrimonial cart. Or she'll do for you. For a woman has an uncanny, hellish strength--she's a she-bear and a wolf, is a woman when she's got the start of you. Oh, it's a terrible experience, if you're not a bourgeois, and not one of the knuckling-under money-making sort." ...|$|E

In places {{it seemed to him}} fine, and in other places queer. About obeying, for instance. If <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> anybody, it seemed rotten to expect them to obey <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>loved</b> them and <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you,</b> there couldn't ever be any {{question}} of obeying, because you would both do the things always of your own accord. And if <b>they</b> didn't <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> or you them, then--oh! then it would be simply too disgusting for anything, to go on living with a person <b>you</b> didn't <b>love</b> or who didn't <b>love</b> <b>you.</b> But of course SHE didn't love his tutor. Had she once? Those bright doubting eyes, that studiously satiric mouth came very clearly up before him. <b>You</b> could not <b>love</b> them; and yet--he was really very decent.

5000|$|... ==Background== In March 2016, {{six years}} {{following}} her {{departure from the}} label, {{it was announced that}} Lopez had returned to Epic Records and Sony Music Entertainment, signing a multi-album deal with the label. She had released two albums under the Universal Music Group, Love? (2011) via Island Records and A.K.A. (2014) via Capitol Records. Lopez, who had been working on music in the midst of her Las Vegas residency, confirmed that she would be releasing new material: [...] "I’ve been working on music {{for the past couple of}} months, and we should be putting something out very soon." [...] "Ain't Your Mama" [...] is the first single Lopez released since resigning with Epic, and is expected to precede her ninth studio album. Co-writer Meghan Trainor who texted Lopez the song said, [...] "I sent it to her and said, ’Do you like the song?’ and she said, ’I love the song, my kid loves the song — he’s made me play it five times already so I know it’s a hit. When can I cut it?’, so I said immediately, ’Whenever you want!'" [...] Lopez described the concept behind [...] "Ain't Your Mama" [...] as [...] "very empowering", and explained: [...] "Guys have this tendency, once <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> in the beginning and you're the hottest woman on Earth, and then all of a sudden, it's like, 'Okay... where's my food?'
