Early digital systems may have suffered {{from a number of}} signal degradations related to the use of analog anti-aliasing filters, e.g., <b>time</b> <b>dispersion,</b> nonlinear distortion, temperature dependence of filters etc. Even with sophisticated anti-aliasing filters used in the recorder, it is still demanding for the player not to introduce more distortion.|$|E
50|$|Because of DNG's {{dispersive}} {{nature as}} a transmission medium, {{it could be useful}} as a dispersion compensation device for time-domain applications. The dispersion produces a variance of the group speed of the signals' wave components, as they propagate in the DNG medium. Hence, stacked DNG metamaterials could be useful for modifying signal propagation along a microstrip transmission line. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>dispersion</b> leads to distortion. However, if the dispersion could be compensated for along the microstrip line, RF or microwave signals propagating along them would significantly decrease distortion. Therefore, components for attenuating distortion become less critical, and could lead to simplification of many systems. Metamaterials can eliminate dispersion along the microstrip by correcting for the frequency dependence of the effective permittivity.|$|E

In many cases a direct measurement is not possible and the electric field value is calculated using linear diffractive optics formulas for the pulse propagation through the media and the pulse characteristics before entering the media.
