5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act's approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, {{to serve as an}} emissary and bring Betances' remains from France.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant is {{historically}} significant {{as the primary}} factory {{for the production of}} Thermos bottles <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> company to dominate in the world market. It is also historically significant {{as an example of the}} Norwich community coming together to attract the company and diversify the local industry. The plant was the primary factory where Thermos bottles were manufactured from raw materials between 1913 and 1984. The complex is architecturally significant as an example of late-19th century and early 20th century industrial mill design being adapted for new industry. The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and argued for a competitive system <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> entry of new players.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} that Red Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a coupon rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a coupon rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to create {{the impression that the}} principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into an attack on the lone ships <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly wind blew up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown too far to the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were still out of position.|$|E
5|$|Writer and co-producer Mike Sussman, {{wrote the}} script the episode, {{originally}} intending {{for it to}} show {{the origins of the}} Orion species. But this was changed to a new species, the Osaarians, during rewrites. The episode was shot over seven days, with the majority of filming taking place on standing ship sets for the Enterprise. The Command Centre set was used for the second time, having previously appeared in the first episode of the season. It had been introduced as a new set for the third season as an area on the Enterprise where the crew would plan their next move in the mission against the Xindi. A new set was created for the brig, where the Osaarian Orgoth was held prisoner. One day of filming was on sets to represent the Osaarian base, with the majority of those made up using green screens <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> sets to be digitally inserted in post production.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner ran for {{governor}} of Santa Cruz in 1991. Although he received only 30 percent of the vote, below the 36 percent of the UCR, he was elected due to the Ley de Lemas that added the votes for the Peronist faction of Puricelli to his own. When Kirchner took office, Santa Cruz was experiencing an economic crisis, with high unemployment and a budget deficit equal to 1.2 billion pesos, which amounted to {{an equal number of}} U.S. dollars because of the Convertibility plan. He expanded the number of provincial Supreme Court justices from three members to five and appointed three judges loyal to him; this gave him control of the provincial judiciary. Kirchner was criticized for preventing the investigation of corruption cases. Santa Cruz received 535 million pesos in oil royalties in 1993, which Kirchner deposited in a foreign bank. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution proposed by the Peronist president Carlos Menem. Kirchner voted against the amendment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> reelection of the president, which was approved. Locally, he proposed an amendment to the provincial constitution authorizing indefinite reelection of the governor. Menem and Kirchner were reelected to their respective offices in 1995. Kirchner established a faction in the PJ opposing Menem's neoliberal economic policies, but Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the populous Buenos Aires province, ignored him and rallied a stronger opposition to Menem within the PJ.|$|E

5|$|Viso {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty and rejoined in tenth position. The race resumed on lap 54 with Power {{retaining}} his lead. The race's third caution was issued {{shortly after the}} restart when Kanaan made light contact with the side of Tagilani who spun. Mario Romancini was blinded by smoke {{that came from the}} incident and was hit by Tagilani who was attempting to regain control of his car. Both cars sustained heavy damage and retired but Kanaan was able to continue without apparent damage. Power led the field back up to speed at the lap-58 restart. Briscoe fell behind the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers, while Tracy moved in front of Hunter-Reay for sixth place. The second (and final) round of green-flag pit stops started on the 63rd lap; Tracy and Hunter-Reay made their pit stops over the next five laps in the hope a caution flag would be shown <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> pair to lead the race. After the pit stops, Power remained in the first position, and had the Alternate tires fitted on his car. He was ahead of Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E
