40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{performance of}} an {{axial flow pump}} with inlet guide vanes for different flow rates is studied in this article. The effects of inlet guide vanes on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of inlet guide vanes to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of inlet guide vanes to negative values at high flow rates. As the net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> When net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> decreases to the value around required net positive <b>suction</b> <b>head,</b> the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together.

The major influences of the dynamic flow on the relationships between the <b>suction</b> <b>head</b> and the degree of saturation are highlighted and discussed. The experimental results show that dynamic flow of water strongly affects the volume of entrapped air. The results also reveal that any scanning curve can be described as two parts, namely, transition and coinciding. The transition curve starts from the recent reversal degree of saturation and continues up to the previous reversal degree of saturation. The shape of the transition curve and the amount of hysteresis are not only a function of the reversal degree of saturation but are also a function of the saturation path history. The experimental results are used to examine the validity of the proposed analytical model by Parker and Lenhard in 1987 for describing the relationships between the degree of saturation and the matric <b>suction</b> <b>head.</b> It was found that Parker and Lenhard¿s model provides a good prediction of the relations provided that care should be taken for the value of the reversal degree of saturation at zero <b>suction</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R

This study deals with the development of experimental methods for measuring <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> in HMA, which can be defined as the free energy state of water in HMA mixes. The <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> is related to the ability of moisture to get into the mix under unsaturated conditions; it is also related to the ability of the mix to retain moisture. Soil suction has been studied extensively. However, suction in HMA as a porous material and its relationship to moisture damage have not been studied. The development of a procedure to measure the <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> in HMA mixes is the first objective of this research. The second objective is to relate suction measurements to physical and chemical properties of the mixtures. The objectives were achieved in two phases. In the first phase, the <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> was measured in HMA specimens with different types of aggregates (limestone and granite), and with different air void distributions and aggregate gradations.

This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of the incipient of cavitation in centrifugal pumps.

The parameters considered in the model were flow rate ratio, pump rational speed, water temperature, thermodynamic properties of water, nuclei and gas content, relative velocity and incidence angle.

Differences between the results obtained using the equations of <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> by Leong et al.

For this reason it appears that the results closer to reality belongs to the Leong et al. (2002) equation.

The tensiometer and TMS 3 are not capable to measure the osmotic suction underestimating its importance, but they can be helpful in building more criteria for an early warning system.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} residual shear strength of different clayey soils at varying <b>total</b> <b>suctions.</b> In a {{first part of the}} paper some insight into the behaviour of residual shear strength of a filled rock discontinuity is presented to bring into light the sensitivity to hydraulic states of a clayey gouge material subjected to shearing along large displacements. An adapted Bromhead ring shear apparatus, in which the sample is enclosed in a controlled relative humidity chamber, has been used to control <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> during shearing. Afterwards, results on different types of clayey materials are presented to discuss the importance of the plasticity of the clay on the residual friction angle changes. These changes show an important increase in the residual friction angle with imposed <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> that may reach 15 ° for medium plastic clay and without cohesion component. The reasons for this increase have been explained by the more granular character of the dry clay as a result of aggregate densification and desaturation during strong drying. The changes have been interpreted using a simple model inspired in both macroscopic and microstructural observations, which is based on the stiffness of the soil (or aggregates) and depends on the product of the <b>total</b> <b>suction</b> applied and the degree of saturation. A microstructural model, already developed to take into account microstructural aspects on water retention and following an equivalent behavioural response to the macroscopic shrinkage curve, has been used to estimate the degree of saturation at the microstructural level (inside aggregates).

However, the test alone might not reflect the leakage rate under different levels of vacuum. To study the characteristics of leakage through exhalation valves, a leakage meter was built to measure the leakage rate of four brands of exhalation valves. Seven valves of each brand were tested for leakage rate at pressure drops ranging from 15 to 45 mmH 2 O (or extended to 75 mmH 2 O for some valves). Two types of leaks, i. e. fiber insertion and arch dent on the valve seat, were used to investigate the effect of leak shape on the characteristic leak flow {{as a function of}} pressure drop.
