As a study case for the model, we use data collected at the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, 23. 2 o S, 44. 5 o W, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Besides geographical distance, the explanatory variables include both pull and push locations’ characteristics to assess their relative role in determining the distinctive traits of emissiveness and attractiveness for all the provinces. We thus consider income, density, accessibility (low-cost flights, transport infrastructure), a set of cultural (museums) and natural (park areas, coasts, well-preserved beaches) factors and other amenities (renowned restaurants). The main results point out that there is a great deal of spatial correlation induced by neighboring provinces at both origin and destination, which is systematically overlooked if one relies only on the gravity specification. Once one controls for such a complex kind of dependence, most of the explanatory variables exhibit the expected effect, with distance and population density showing a negative impact on tourists’ decisions when choosing a specific destination, while amenities, accessibility and income turn out to be effective determinants of <b>tourism</b> <b>flows.</b> Keywords: <b>tourism</b> <b>flows,</b> spatial origin-destination interaction models, product differentiation, amenities, Italy JEL code: C 21, D 12, L 83, Q 26, R 11...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>tourism</b> <b>flows</b> on demand for large {{regional}} and city theatres in Austria over the period from 1972 to 2011 (39 years). The results are obtained by applying an aggregated theatre demand function for both residents and tourists. The elasticity of theatre attendance in response to tourism is estimated along with other standard demand variables such as ticket price and income. The quality factors and theatre-specific effects are also included. The <b>tourism</b> <b>flows</b> variables are derived using detailed data set on tourist arrivals and their overnight counts, and they are also split between domestic and foreign tourists. To measure {{the impact of}} <b>tourism</b> <b>flows</b> on theatre demand, three alternative theatre markets specifications are considered. The total elasticity of attendance per capita in response to tourism is estimated between 15 and 20 %, indicating that {{increasing the number of}} arrivals by two tourists per resident in the relevant market would generate an increase in theatre attendance by 581 - 680 thousand visitors per year.
