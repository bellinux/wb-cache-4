5|$|In 1610 the Constable gave <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> {{a convent}} in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was {{on condition that}} the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> be used as a ciborium, or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E

5|$|In January 1910, Ottawa {{defeated}} Galt, {{champions of}} the OPHL, during the CHA regular season, as well as Edmonton of the AAHA during the NHA regular season (the Senators switched leagues in-between). At {{the end of the}} season Ottawa gave up <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>to</b> the Montreal Wanderers, regular-season {{champions of the}} new NHA league. Unlike the 1906 case, the Hockey Hall of Fame does not recognize the Senators as champions for January 1910, although the NHL does.|$|E

5|$|After the Puerto Rican league season {{came to an}} end in 1932, Coimbre went to work as a {{security}} guard in a penal institution and only played with a semi-professional team. Shortly after, he was offered a contract to play in La Guaira, with a team called Santa Marta. The season concluded with Buchipluma, a second team owned by Santa Marta's proprietor winning the league's championship. Following his participation with Santa Marta, he continued playing, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. While playing with Licey, the team developed a rivalry with El Escogido, which gave Coimbre an opportunity to establish relationships with several players, from both countries. During this period the team continued to be coached by Dore, and included several known Dominican players. The team would win the league's championship once, but Coimbre decided not to assist the ceremony where the trophy was awarded choosing to stay in his hotel room instead. Dore took <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> Coimbre so that he could have it in his possession some days, but he rejected this and suggested that it be filled with money for a donation.|$|E
5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were {{bought by the}} NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left {{competing}} for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished {{to play for the}} Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement. The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating, {{as was the case in}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, with Kinnaird {{back in the}} team, Wanderers overcame indifferent early form {{to again}} reach the Cup final, and defeated Oxford University to retain the trophy. Wanderers again dominated the competition in the 1877–78 season, scoring nine goals in both their first and second round matches. The final was a rematch of the 1872 final and Wanderers again defeated Royal Engineers to win an unprecedented third consecutive FA Cup. The rules of the competition stated that under such circumstances the trophy would be retired and become the permanent property of the victorious club, but Alcock returned <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> the FA {{on the condition that}} the rule be removed and no other team permitted to claim it on a permanent basis. Following the final, Wanderers played the reigning Scottish Cup holders, Vale of Leven, but lost 3–1.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving <b>the</b> <b>Cup,</b> <b>to</b> hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E

25|$|In November 1952 Harold W. Parsons, an art {{historian}} and one of Warren's past companions, took responsibility for selling the cup and approached the New York collector Walter Baker, however Baker was hesitant to proceed. In February 1953 it was posted by Thomas to Walter Baker, however US Customs impounded the box requiring a decision from Washington to admit it as pornography, it was refused entry to the US on this basis and took until October 1954 {{to be returned to}} the UK, by which time Thomas had died. After this event, a number of museums declined to buy it. Thomas' widow sold <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> the dealer John K. Hewett. Hewett offered <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>to</b> Denys Haynes, Keeper of the Greek and Roman department at the British Museum who then sought an opinion from his friend Lord Crawford, a trustee of the museum. However the decision went no further as they thought that they would never persuade the museum's trustees who were chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
