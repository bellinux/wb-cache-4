5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E

40|$|Postmodern {{readings}} of Nietzsche typically misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as {{paving the way}} for acceptance of a self, a world, characterized by fundamental disunity. In contrast I suggest that Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is less a gesture at philosophical reform than a call to engage in a purposive self creation under a unifying will, a will that the possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with <b>the</b> <b>postmoderns</b> that unity is not a pre-given. Where he parts from them is in their complete rejection of unity as a goal. On the descriptive side, Nietzsche and the post-moderns agree that the received notion of the unified Cartesian subject is a myth, however on the prescriptive side, while <b>the</b> <b>postmoderns</b> celebrate <b>the</b> death of the subject Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable and hence worthy of such a goal. To this extent <b>the</b> <b>postmoderns</b> are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman...|$|R

25|$|Postmodern {{classical}} music as well {{is not a}} musical style, but rather refers to music of <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> era.

Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with postmodernist art—that is, art that comes after and reacts against modernism.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 {{the term}} was used to {{describe}} a dissatisfaction with modern architecture, and led to <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> architecture movement, and {{a response to the}} modernist architectural movement known as the International Style.

25|$|Though {{representing}} a general return to certain notions of music-making {{that are often}} considered to be classical or romantic, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, {{in reaction to the}} rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> influence in musical composition.|$|E
25|$|Associated with {{painters}} such as Frank Stella, minimalism in painting, {{as opposed}} to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> movement. Seen {{from the perspective of}} writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.|$|E

25|$|Richard Rorty {{argues in}} Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature that {{contemporary}} analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon {{the independence of}} knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes <b>the</b> <b>postmodern</b> strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>postmodern</b> impulse in {{classical}} music {{arose in the}} 1960s {{with the advent of}} musical minimalism. Composers such as Terry Riley, Henryk Górecki, Bradley Joseph, John Adams, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, and Lou Harrison reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably John Cage challenged the prevailing narratives of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.|$|E
