5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius). <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{reproductive}} organs include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, {{which can be}} partially or totally fused. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|In the United States <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> a {{separate}} Statement of functional expenses distributes each {{expense of the}} organization into amounts related to the organization's various functions. These functions are segregated into two broad categories: program services and supporting services. Program services are the mission-related activities performed by the organization. Non-program supporting services include the costs of fund-raising events, management and general administration.|$|E

50|$|The New Hope Primitive Baptist Church {{was located}} <b>there,</b> and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been one store.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>may</b> be more {{parties in}} the integration, for example the primary {{customer}} (consumer) can have their own customers; <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> multiple providers.|$|R
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been a formal Tudor garden and there may have been fish ponds.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be equipment linked to this such as winches which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
50|$|There were {{at least}} six {{separate}} attacks, and eight suicide bombers involved. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been other attackers.|$|R
50|$|The {{ossicles}} (three on each side) {{are usually}} not included as bones of the neurocranium. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> variably <b>also</b> be extra sutural bones present.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been a planned, but {{unfinished}} 3D sequel by Panda Entertainment. However, {{the former}} owner of Panda's intellectual properties stated that no records {{of any such}} title exist.|$|R
5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation {{in the chest and}} abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E
5000|$|Near {{the hamlet}} of Ruderbaum, {{the remains of}} a Horgen culture {{settlement}} have been discovered. Below the Horgen site, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> be Pfyn culture site, but that is less certain.|$|R
50|$|On {{the track}} <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> some turbo areas marked with an arrow with a {{specific}} length and direction. When a vehicle goes through this area, the principal point is moved {{as indicated by the}} arrow.|$|R

5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} in {{conjunction}} with such catchment schemes, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been nearby sedentary settlements of people who maintained them. There is evidence at Lake Condah in Victoria of houses {{in conjunction with}} eel traps dating back about 8,000 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be synesthetic experiences. Glossolalia (speaking in tongues) {{has been}} {{reported}} by Reason magazine.|$|R

5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, {{the economic and social}} tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Bow Back Rivers cross an area {{originally}} {{known as}} Stratford Marsh, {{an area of}} common Lammas land, where inhabitants had common rights to graze horses and cattle between Lammas Day (1 August) and Lady Day (25 March), but which was used for growing hay {{for the rest of}} the year. The Marsh was between Stratford-Langthorne and Stratford-at-Bow. Little remains from pre-history, but the names suggest that the two settlements lay at either end of a stone causeway across the marsh. Remains of a stone causeway have been found, but no traces of an associated road. The ford at Old Ford is of pre-Roman origin, part of a route from London to Essex which crossed Bethnal Green. In the Roman era, a new road was built from London to the ford, which carried the principal road to Colchester. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been a ford further south at Bow, and a further causeway existed between Homerton and Leyton, known as Wanstead Slip.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{continued until}} 4:25pm. By {{that time the}} German ships had shot down seven Beaufighters. Fw 190As had claimed another two Beaufighters and a Mustang III. The Allied losses included six of the eleven No.404 Squadron aircraft involved in the attack. Overall, the Germans killed 14 Allied airmen and took four prisoner of war. The Allies damaged Z33 {{and several of the}} other German ships and shot down either four or five Fw190s. Linz and another German pilot were killed. Kriegsmarine fatalities included four sailors on Z33 and three on the converted trawler VP6808; both of these ships were damaged during the attack. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have been fatalities on the other German ships.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the debt deflation there was a component of productivity deflation that had been occurring since The Great Deflation of {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century. [...] <b>There</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> been a continuation of the correction to the sharp inflation caused by WW I.|$|R
50|$|National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) is a Parks Canada {{programme}} {{responsible for}} marine areas managed for sustainability and containing smaller zones of high protection. They include the seabed, the water itself and any species which occur <b>there.</b> They <b>may</b> <b>also</b> include wetlands, estuaries, islands and other coastal lands.|$|R
50|$|The Altai Turks may {{be related}} to {{neighboring}} Ugric, Samoyedic, Ket, or Mongols. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> ethnographic traces of such past of these nowadays Turkic-speaking peoples of the Altai. For example, some of them have phallic-erotic fertility rites, and that can be compared to similar rites of Obi-Ugric peoples.|$|R
5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the troop is the senior patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a patrol leader who then appoints an assistant patrol leader and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be {{the possibility of an}} infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings <b>There</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E
50|$|Probate {{research}} {{deals with}} finding heirs and proving {{their right to}} an inheritance. In some estates <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be no known heirs, or <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be missing heirs whose names are known but their contact information is not. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> be known heirs {{from one part of}} the family, but another part of the family may be unknown. In all these instances, professional probate researchers work to trace the next-of-kin.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{plans to build}} a new {{passenger}} terminal, Terminal Four, at Singapore Changi Airport. The details for the construction is that it might have to be extended out onto Changi East where there is now a big empty plot of land. <b>There</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> {{plans to build a}}nother runway.|$|R
50|$|St Rumwold was {{a little-known}} Saxon Saint who {{is said to}} have preached the Gospel after his baptism as an infant; his resting place is {{recorded}} as being in Buckingham, but it is thought that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> be some connection with Romaldkirk in Northern England, which is not properly recorded.|$|R
