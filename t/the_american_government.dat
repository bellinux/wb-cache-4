5|$|An {{important}} {{national conference}} was also {{held at the}} hotel by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> in 1980. In the late 1980s a supposed secret meeting {{was held at the}} hotel by three Republicans—Richard V. Allen, Laurence H. Silberman and Robert McFarlane—with an Iranian emissary. From its opening until May 2005, the hotel was managed by Loews Hotels. For the next five years, it was managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts, but the Davidson Hotel Company assumed control of its operations in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of active Islamists in London began to cause tensions with Middle Eastern, European, Pakistani and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>governments,</b> who view {{many of these}} groups as terrorists.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} DC Universe during {{the events of}} Infinite Crisis, the Amazons return to attack Washington, D.C. in {{retaliation}} for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government's</b> illegal detention of Wonder Woman.|$|R
5|$|Season 5, set 18 months after, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack is {{believed}} to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government.</b> The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E
5|$|The project {{also served}} as a {{political}} ruse on the part of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> providing a diplomatic channel for NASA {{to take part in the}} funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep Mir operating, in addition to the Russian space program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of popular}} and {{government}} interest at the time in quantum mechanics – <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government.</b> The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th and the {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina. This ended peacefully in 1902, but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own. The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera's son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By {{this time}} the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera's home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk {{off the coast of}} Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa {{expected}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> saw the {{evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in {{the evacuation}} was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} aid from <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Government</b> {{in the aftermath}} of the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E

The version {{on the album}} is a remix of the original version, which was made available as a free download on March 25, 2003 from the band's website. The song was written as a protest of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government's</b> actions in <b>the</b> Iraq War.|$|R
5|$|White {{settlers}} who {{had traveled}} to Oregon along the Oregon Trail began {{to live in the}} high desert region in the 1850s and the 1860s, after they had begun farming and logging in the Willamette Valley and other lands in western Oregon. Thousands of these emigrants reached the area from the west, crossing the Cascade Range to make land claims in eastern Oregon. The high desert area was settled by whites later than western Oregon in part because of Elijah White's failure to find a pass east through the Cascades. Once they had claimed more land, pioneers and members of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> negotiated treaties with natives in the high desert and elsewhere in Oregon, often forcing them off their native lands and on to reservations.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government</b> was {{becoming}} increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, Cleveland {{adopted a}} broad {{interpretation}} of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>government,</b> having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded {{the bulk of the}} disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.|$|E
