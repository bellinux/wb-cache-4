5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited <b>to</b> <b>Americans.</b> He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own.

5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> of all races.|$|E
5|$|El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290–1342) {{imported}} {{and bred}} numerous Arabians in Egypt.

Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, <b>to</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> outside Alaska.|$|E

5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> as a people.

The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness the implementation of a democratic system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E
5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza lay in a 1919 attempt {{by the city of}} Indianapolis to lure the newly formed American Legion from its {{temporary}} headquarters in New York City. The American Legion, chartered by Congress in 1919 after World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security, and provides commitment <b>to</b> <b>Americans</b> who have served in the armed forces. Three Indianapolis veterans wanted to attract the Legion to the city, which already had the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis during November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows of patriotism. Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes out of 684 cast.|$|E
