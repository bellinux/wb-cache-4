To be sure we were glad enough to get rid of such wretched plagues; but yet honesty made us ingenuously represent to them, by what we ourselves had suffered, the certain destruction they were running into, either of being starved to death or murdered by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied, that they neither could nor would work: and consequently that they might as well be starved abroad as at home: & neither had they any wives or children to cry after them: nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they had but the canoe they would have gone without them.|$|E

RR: What should enrollment managers know about developmental education? Neuburger: Developmental education serves as a “second chance ” for many students coming out of a non-college preparatory track from high school. For our adult populations returning to college, developmental courses serve as “refresher ” curriculum in the complexity and depth of reading, writing, and mathematics required for college-level courses. Under different names, educational vehicles for delivering academic support to ensure access and opportunity have been with us since our nation’s beginnings. Now we are engaged in a great discussion—testing how to continue in this educational tradition. We are hearing that too many students do not successfully pass from the lowest level of developmental education on to their degrees. That is actually highlighting the fact that developmental education has, unfortunately, also been used as a de facto “ability to benefit” measure and as a gatekeeper. Much like gatekeeper courses in the disciplines—that have traditionally been used to determine which students may continue in the major and whic...|$|E

We need not seek in dismal church-yards nor sleep in moated granges to see the shadowy faces and hear the {{rustling}} of their garments in the night.

Some are living, some are dead. We know not. We clasped their hands once, loved them, quarreled with them, laughed with them, told them our thoughts and hopes and aims, as they told us theirs, till it seemed our very hearts had joined in a grip that would defy the puny power of Death. They are gone now; lost to us forever. Their eyes will never look into ours again and their voices we shall never hear.

40|$|When I {{learned that}} my father was under-going surgery for an “almost {{ruptured}} ” abdominal aneurysm, I was a licensed professional nurse for two years and had happily begun to feel competent about my nursing prac-tice. In the week I spent in the hospital, fi rst in the surgical waiting room and then at his bedside, I learned so much more about the type of care that matters to patients and their loved ones. I can still remember the nurse who kept us informed about {{what was happening in the}} operating room (OR). Each time she came out <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> she crouched on her haunches to be on eye level with us. It was my fi rst lesson about the importance of equalizing the power differentials in the hospital— and it stuck. In the intervening years it has often been the illness of a friend or family member that has continued to challenge the adequacy of my practice. So I was eager to read these narratives written by bioethicists about the experience of their own illness or that of a loved one. I read as a family member and friend of the seriously ill and dying, as a nurse, as an ethicist, and as an educator of health care professionals. My fi rst quick read of the narratives produced an almost overwhelming sense of despair. I know all too well that health care isn’t perfect, but most of the essays described in some exquisite detail colossal failures of health professionals or mundane failures with sometimes, profound results. How long will it take us to “get it right? ” Are our now long and serious efforts to produce the next generation of humane healer...|$|E

6000|$|May 8th.--This morning my {{wife and}} I went to breakfast with Mrs. William Story at the Barberini Palace, expecting to meet Mrs. Jameson, {{who has been in}} Rome for a month or two. We had a very {{pleasant}} breakfast, but Mrs. Jameson was not present on account of indisposition, and the only other guests were Mrs. A------ and Mrs. H------, two sensible American ladies. Mrs. Story, however, received a note from Mrs. Jameson, asking her to bring us to see her at her lodgings; so {{in the course of the}} afternoon she called on us, and took us thither in her carriage. Mrs. Jameson lives on the first piano of an old palazzo on the Via di Ripetta, nearly opposite the ferry-way across the Tiber, and affording a pleasant view of the yellow river and the green bank and fields on the other side. I had expected to see an elderly lady, but not quite so venerable a one as Mrs. Jameson proved to be; a rather short, round, and massive personage, of benign and agreeable aspect, with a sort of black skullcap on her head, beneath which appeared her hair, which seemed once to have been fair, and was now almost white. I should take her to be about seventy years old. She began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> affectionate familiarity, and was particularly kind in her manifestations towards myself, who, on my part, was equally gracious towards her. In truth, I have found great pleasure and profit in her works, and was glad to hear her say that she liked mine. We talked about art, and she showed us a picture leaning up against the wall of the room; a quaint old Byzantine painting, with a gilded background, and two stiff figures (our Saviour and St. Catherine) standing shyly at a sacred distance from one another, and going through the marriage ceremony. There was a great deal of expression in their faces and figures; and the spectator feels, moreover, that the artist must have been a devout man,--an impression which we seldom receive from modern pictures, however awfully holy the subject, or however consecrated the place they hang in. Mrs. Jameson seems to be familiar with Italy, its people and life, as well as with its picture-galleries. She is said to be rather irascible in her temper; but nothing could be sweeter than her voice, her look, and all her manifestations to-day. When we were coming away she clasped my hand in both of hers, and again expressed the pleasure of having seen me, and her gratitude to me for calling on her; nor did I refrain from responding Amen to these effusions.

6000|$|In this matter, then, {{as in all}} {{the other}} matters treated in this book, our main {{conclusion}} {{is that it is}} a fundamental point of view, a philosophy or religion which is needed, and not any change in habit or social routine. The things we need most for immediate practical purposes are all abstractions. We need a right view of the human lot, a right view of the human society; and if we were living eagerly and angrily in the enthusiasm of those things, we should, ipso facto, be living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense. Desire and danger make every one simple. And <b>to</b> those who <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> interfering eloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the skin, and about Plasmon and the coats of the stomach, at them shall only be hurled the words that are hurled at fops and gluttons, [...] "Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." [...] Those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good, practical politics; they are also superlatively good hygiene. The one supreme way of making all those processes go right, the processes of health, and strength, and grace, and beauty, the one and only way of making certain of their accuracy, is to think about something else. If a man is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven, he may be quite easy about the pores of his skin. If he harnesses his waggon to a star, the process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his stomach. For the thing called [...] "taking thought," [...] the thing for which the best modern word is [...] "rationalizing," [...] is in its nature, inapplicable to all plain and urgent things. Men take thought and ponder rationalistically, touching remote things--things that only theoretically matter, such as the transit of Venus. But only at their peril can men rationalize about so practical a matter as health.|$|R
