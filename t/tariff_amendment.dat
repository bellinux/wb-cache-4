The CAISO describes a RSSR as an import into the CAISO Balancing Authority Area for which the resource owner identifies the specific resource that will provide the services it is bidding into the CAISO markets. The CAISO notes that during the development of the MRTU Tariff, stakeholders requested the ability for RSSR owners to be eligible for Bid Cost Recovery, similar to owners of resources internal to the CAISO Balancing Authority Area (i. e., Participating Generators). The CAISO states that it supports permitting resources that provide imports to be eligible for Bid Cost Recovery, provided that there is an appropriate mechanism to enforce the requirements associated with eligibility for payment.

Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Minister Greg Combet and Treasurer Wayne Swan released drafts of the key bills in the package on 28 July 2011. The consultation runs until 22 August 2011. The package will give businesses and investors certainty about the carbon price, allowing them to plan new investments in renewable and clean energy technologies. The Clean Energy Legislative Package includes four main bills: The Clean Energy Bill 2011 (which sets up the carbon price mechanism); The Clean Energy Regulator Bill 2011 (which establishes a regulatory body to administer the mechanism); The Climate Change Authority Bill 2011 (which establishes a new Authority to advise the government on the future design of the carbon price mechanism) and The Clean Energy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. The package also includes details of the Government’s Jobs and Competiveness Program, which will assist emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries.  It also includes details of the Energy Security Fund, which will assist electricity generators to ensure energy security. A bill on the Government’s household assistance measures announced is currently being drafted. This legislation {{will be part of the}} whole package that will be introduced into Parliament later this year and will deliver the Government’s commitments to households in full. The Government will provide tax cuts, increases in family payments and higher pensions and other benefits to assist households with the modest cost impacts of a carbon price. Submissions on the Clean Energy Legislative Package can be sent to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency until 5 pm on Monday, 22 August 2011. Note: The legislation to implement household assistance in relation to the carbon price will not be exposed in draft.

5000|$|On September 3, 2007, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) {{issued the}} Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable Services) Interconnection (Fourth Amendment) Regulation 2007, which went into law on December 1; the rules require all {{broadcasters}} to offer channels on an {{a la carte}} basis. The regulation states, [...] "All broadcasters will compulsorily offer all their channels on a la carte basis to DTH operators. Additionally, they may also offer bouquets, {{but they will not}} compel any DTH operator to include the entire bouquet in any package being offered by DTH operators to their subscribers". Prior to the regulation, only customers in areas covered by the conditional access system (CAS), and cable systems providing the services, had the option of choosing to buy only the channels they were interested in. TRAI intervened after DTH operators complained that broadcasters were forcing them to carry channels that they did not want. In the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Services (Second) <b>Tariff</b> (Eighth <b>Amendment)</b> Order, 2007 (a revision of the earlier regulation issued on October 4, 2007), broadcasters were ordered to offer all channels on an a la carte basis to cable providers.

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} through {{solar photovoltaic}} (PV) {{technology has been}} one of the leading renewable energy generation options in the global arena and in many countries that are working to address increasing energy demand and high fuel import dependencies. Due to the feed in <b>tariff</b> (FIT) <b>amendment</b> in 2011 and decreasing costs in global PV sector, the interest in this emerging market is quickly increasing in Turkey. The aim of this thesis is to explore the prospects for development of the solar PV market in Turkey, considering residential, commercial and utility scale PV systems with rooftop or ground mounted installations. The economic situation, the energy profile, regulatory framework for solar energy and the market conditions in the country were researched. The ultimate purpose was to assess the overall conditions to attract investors, and estimate the development of the solar PV market growth in Turkey particularly in the next few years. High irradiation levels, limited domestic energy resources and high interest in license applications suggest a big potential for solar PV electricity in Turkey. However, the regulatory framework is not yet suitable for a fast growth of this emerging solar PV market in the country due to lack of political support and experience in related government functions. Despite the high interest and demand for commercial systems, the solar PV market in Turkey is expected to grow linearly as a start. This contrast with precedents in leading European markets, which experienced exponential growth at the beginning. This study shows that there is a need for performance improvement within the regulative authorities, time for stakeholders to experience the market and more comprehensive and stable legislation. However, in the long term, solar PV technology is expected to gain high competitive advantage due to improving financial conditions in the country, increase in electricity prices (e. g. grid parity has already been reached for residential systems), and cost reductions for PV components around the world...|$|R
