5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

5|$|Tracking Tito's {{family is}} a man known as Brown, a brusque and obstinate lead covert {{operative}} for a shadowy organization of unclear connection to the U.S. government.

Brown believes that Tito and the old man are in possession of information that would, if revealed, undermine public confidence in the U.S.'s participation in the Iraq War. In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E

So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> requested that he become his student.|$|E

25|$|The answer {{assumes a}} third level on which <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea must be read—as {{a sort of}} allegorical {{commentary}} on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating {{what might be called}} his philosophy of Manhood {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a consideration on determination of parse tree by using operator precedence. Noun phrase of natural language has structual ambiguity. For example, the noun phrase 2 ̆ 2 <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women 2 ̆ 2 has two different structures, namely, two parse trees 2 ̆ 2 <b>the</b> <b>old</b> (<b>men</b> <b>and</b> women) 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>the</b> (<b>old</b> <b>men)</b> <b>and</b> women 2 ̆ 2. In addition, the expression 2 ̆ 2 A+B*C 2 ̆ 2 has two different structures, namely, 2 ̆ 2 (A+B) *C 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 A+(B*C) 2 ̆ 2.

500|$|In 1958, Tracy {{appeared}} in <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea, {{a project that}} had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same name, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: [...] "Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy." [...] Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a [...] "terrible liability to the picture", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight. Appearing alone on screen {{for the majority of the}} film, Tracy considered <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality." [...] Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.|$|E

[...] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, [...] "changed the nature of American writing." [...] In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for [...] "his mastery {{of the art of}} narrative, most recently demonstrated in <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style." ...|$|E
