40|$|Broadband {{dielectric}} spectroscopy {{was applied}} to study {{the influence of the}} dispersed hydrophilic aerosil particle densities on the second-order smectic-A-smectic-C* phase transition and polarization sign reversal in the ferroelectric liquid crystal S-(-) - 2 -methylbutyl 4 -n-nonanoyloxybiphenyl- 4 '-carboxylate. With increasing aerosil concentration the dielectric strength of the soft and <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode considerably decreases and the complete disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode at p(s) = 0. 20 g/cm(3) occurs along with significant broadening of the soft mode. The characteristic frequency of <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode slightly increases with increasing density of the silica particles. The frequency degeneracy taking place in the smectic-A-smectic-C* phase transition is removed in the presence of aerosil and an increase in the frequency gap is observed. In a point of polarization sign reversal a rapid drop of the dielectric strength and the disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode was detected for bulk and confined ferroelectric liquid crystal. However, with increasing concentration of aerosil particles the dielectric strength of <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode decreases as a function of temperature stronger below than above the sign reversal point. The characteristic frequency of <b>the</b> <b>Goldstone</b> mode below <b>the</b> point of polarization sign reversal decreases with increasing aerosil concentration.
