5000|$|In 1927 {{he founded}} the [...] "Dinglerwerk" [...] business, {{employing}} ten people at a premises in the old town centre, producing oil mills, sawmills and, in particular, hand operated printing presses. Dingler invented a form of <b>Toggle</b> <b>press</b> which he called the [...] "Zweibrücker-press" [...] but which {{became known as the}} [...] "Dingler Press". The success of the Dingler Press across much of Europe funded a rapid growth of the business.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{the design of a}} {{manually}} operated soil compaction machine that is being used to manufacture stabilized soil blocks (SSB). A case study of manufacturing more than three million blocks in a housing project using manually operated machines is illustrated. The paper is focussed on the design, development, and evaluation of a manually operated soil compaction machine for the production of SSB. It also details the machine design philosophy, compaction characteristics of soils, employment generation potential of small-scale stabilized soil block productions systems, and embodied energy. Static compaction of partially saturated soils was performed to generate force-displacement curves in a confined compaction process were generated. Based on the soil compaction data engineering design aspects of a <b>toggle</b> <b>press</b> are illustrated. The results of time and motion study on block production operations using manual machines are discussed. Critical path network diagrams were used for small-scale SSB production systems. Such production systems generate employment at a very low capital cost...|$|E
50|$|Sagendorph was an {{inventor}} {{as well as}} a manufacturer. From 1879 to 1905 he secured more than 100 U.S. and foreign patents for sheet metal manufacturing machinery such as roller dies, the sleeve die, automatic feeding mechanisms for press work, power squaring shears, <b>toggle</b> <b>presses,</b> machines for shearing and punching sheet steel, and the original method of corrugating sheets by means of rolls.|$|R
50|$|In industry, <b>toggle</b> action <b>presses</b> {{are still}} popular. The usual {{arrangement}} involves {{a very strong}} crankshaft and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press. Large and heavy flywheels are driven by electric motors but the flywheels only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated.|$|R
50|$|While {{the typical}} locking {{behaviour}} on keyboards with Caps Lock key {{is that of}} a <b>toggle,</b> each <b>press</b> reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode, where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode.|$|R
50|$|Caps Lock is {{a button}} on a {{computer}} keyboard that, when pressed, causes all letters to be generated in capitals until deactivated. It {{is located in the}} position of a similar Shift lock key (and sometimes a Ctrl key) found in some other keyboard layouts. It is usually a <b>toggle</b> key: each <b>press</b> reverses its action.|$|R
40|$|The project {{elaborated}} {{in frame}} of engineering studies branch Engineering technology submitted technology design of manufacturing a control element by extrusion – part of aluminium alloy EN AW 6082. On {{the base of}} literature study of the cold forming problems and calculations was designed procedure on one operation. Semi-finished product was chosen cut block rods with a diameter of 43. 5 mm and length of 17, 4 mm. The production is designed for <b>toggle</b> stamping <b>press</b> LLR 400 (producer Šmeral Brno a. s.) with a nominal force 4000 kN. Extrusion punch and extrusion die are made of steel alloy 19 830. 4 heat-worked according to drawing documentation...|$|R
