25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a clash between the Los Villanos brothers, Villano III, Villano IV, and Villano V and several wrestlers from the La Lagunero area of Mexico, the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, and Black Warrior who had {{developed}} a rivalry with the brothers over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months</b> and who would have repeated clashes over the years following the 2000 Sin Piedad show. The fifth match {{of the night}} would see the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"; Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero) defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the team of El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas. Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas were the previous holders of the championship, but were forced to vacate the title when Hijo del Santo stopped working for CMLL on a full time basis in mid-2000. Los Guerreros del Infierno had won a tournament for the vacant titles only a month earlier when the two defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal show. Hijo del Santo returned to CMLL during the tournament, immediately challenging the new champions for a title match since they never defeated the duo of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas for the championship.|$|E
