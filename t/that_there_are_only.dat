5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} to the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium {{makes it possible to}} use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, Veridian Dynamics, experiments on its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that Veridian has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> three governments {{left in the world}} which are more powerful than Veridian. Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at least partially in the science fiction genre.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} {{described in}} Asia include the Altai wapiti (C. canadensis sibiricus) and the Tianshan wapiti (C. canadensis songaricus). Two distinct subspecies found in China and Korea are the Manchurian wapiti (C. canadensis xanthopygus) and the Alashan wapitis (C. canadensis alashanicus). The Manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration {{than the other}} populations. The Alashan wapiti of north central China is the smallest of all subspecies, has the lightest coloration and is the least studied. Biologist Valerius Geist, who has written on the world's various deer species, holds <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> three subspecies of elk. Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan wapiti but places all other elk into C. canadensis canadensis, claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as subspecies is driven, at least partly, for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures {{for each of the}} surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> a few thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring {{for over a century}} following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E

25|$|One year later, at {{the request}} of the bishop of Meaux, he wrote The Harmony of Numbers in which he {{considers}} a problem of Philippe de Vitry involving so-called harmonic numbers, which have the form 2m·3n. The problem was to characterize all pairs of harmonic numbers differing by 1. Gersonides proved <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> four such pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) and (8,9).|$|E

25|$|A longstanding Pisot–Vijayaraghavan problem {{asks whether}} the {{assumption}} that α is algebraic can be dropped from the last statement. If the answer is affirmative, Pisot's numbers would be characterized among all real numbers by the simple convergence of ||λα'n|| to 0 for some auxiliary real λ. It is known <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> countably many numbers α with this property. The problem is to decide whether any of them is transcendental.|$|E
25|$|Note that a {{compound}} engine (including multiple-expansion engines, see below) {{can have more}} than one set of variable-pressure cylinders. For example, an engine might have two cylinders operating at pressure x and two operating at pressure y, or one cylinder operating at pressure x and three operating at pressure y. What makes it compound (or double-expansion) as opposed to multiple-expansion is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> two pressures, x and y.|$|E
25|$|The {{discriminant}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic invariants of a number field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of K, and the analytic class number formula for K.

25|$|The {{lanthanide}} metals are soft; their hardness increases {{across the}} series. Europium stands out, {{as it has}} the lowest density in the series at 5.24 g/cm3 and the largest metallic radius in the series at 208.4 pm. It {{can be compared to}} barium, which has a metallic radius of 222 pm. It is believed that the metal contains the larger Eu2+ ion and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> two electrons in the conduction band. Ytterbium also has a large metallic radius, and a similar explanation is suggested.|$|E
25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the status}} of Confucianism in Indonesia in the New Order regime was never clear. De jure, there were {{conflicting}} laws, because the higher law permitted Confucianism, but the lower law did not recognise it. De facto, Confucianists were not recognised {{by the government and}} they were forced to become Christians or Buddhists to maintain their citizenship. This practice was applied in many places, including the national registration card, marriage registration, and family registration card. Civics education in Indonesia taught school children <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> five official religions.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} production of this compound is somewhat {{similar to the}} Mond process in that the metal is treated with carbon monoxide to give a volatile gas. In the case of iron pentacarbonyl, the reaction is more sluggish. It is necessary to use iron sponge as the starting material, and harsher reaction conditions of 5–30MPa of carbon monoxide and 150–200°C. Similar to the Mond process, sulfur acts as a catalyst. The crude iron pentacarbonyl is purified by distillation. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry reports <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> three plants manufacturing pentacarbonyliron; BASF in Germany and GAF in Alabama have capacities of 9000 and 1500–2000 tonnes/year respectively.|$|E
25|$|On {{economic}} development, Unger {{has noted}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> two models {{for a national}} economy available to us today: the US model of business control of government, and the northeast Asian model of top down bureaucratic control of the economy. Citing the need for greater imagination on the issue, he has offered a third model that is decentralized, pluralistic, participatory, and experimental. This would {{take the form of}} an economy encouraging small business development and innovation that would create large scale self-employment and cooperation. The emphasis is not on the protection of big business as the main sectors of the economy, but the highly mobile and innovative small firm.|$|E
