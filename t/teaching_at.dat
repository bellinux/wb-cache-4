5|$|Scrushy {{soon found}} himself {{living in a}} Selma trailer park and working manual labor jobs to support his family. After a run-in with a boss, Scrushy quit his job hauling cement and {{decided to return to}} school. He earned his GED, and at his mother's advice, began {{studying}} respiratory therapy at Wallace State Community College. After a year at Wallace State, Scrushy transferred to Jefferson State Community College and later entered the respiratory therapy program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).

5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience {{gave him a}} sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E

5|$|By age sixteen, Sampson was <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> Indian Creek School in Laurel County. He {{attended}} Union College in Barbourville, then {{enrolled at}} Valparaiso University. He was class president for three years, and earned an A.B. in 1894. Per university policy, {{he was also}} awarded and an LL.B. because, prior to graduation, he had studied {{for at least one}} year in a law office. He returned to Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in June 1895.|$|E
5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 Byard {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in jazz education: he began <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> the New England Conservatory of Music {{and went on to}} work at several other music institutions, as well as having private students. He continued performing and recording, mainly in solo and small group settings, but he also led two big bands – one made up of some of his students, and the other of professional musicians. His death, from a single gunshot while in his home, remains an unsolved mystery.|$|E

5|$|He {{worked closely}} with Nobel Prize-winning {{experimental}} physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data their machines were producing at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1936 Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3300 per annum. In return {{he was asked to}} curtail his <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> the {{university}} ebbed {{in his final}} years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} teach at the RAM, with which he was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life.

Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music.

5|$|In 1925–26, while <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took {{additional}} {{courses in}} law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis}} for full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Friedman {{submitted}} Incomes from Independent Professional Practice (co-authored with Kuznets {{and completed}} during 1940) to Columbia as his doctoral dissertation. The university awarded him a PhD in 1946. Friedman spent the 1945–1946 academic year <b>teaching</b> <b>at</b> the University of Minnesota (where his friend George Stigler was employed).
