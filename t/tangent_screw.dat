50|$|Jesse Ramsden {{followed}} duc de Chaulnes by {{five years}} in the production of his dividing engine. As with the prior inventions, Ramsden's used a <b>tangent</b> <b>screw</b> mechanism to advance the machine from one position to another. However, he had developed a screw-cutting lathe that was particularly advanced and produced a superior product. This engine was developed with funding from the Board of Longitude on condition that it be described in detail (along with the related screw-cutting lathe) and not be protected by patent. This allowed others to freely copy the device and improve on it. In fact, the Board required that he teach others to construct their own copies and make his dividing engine available to graduate instruments made by others.|$|E
50|$|Side error:This {{occurs when}} the horizon glass/mirror is not {{perpendicular}} to {{the plane of the}} instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the <b>tangent</b> <b>screw</b> back and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. The user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error; adjust the horizon glass/mirror until the stars merge into one image or the horizons are merged into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} {{heliograph}} types. Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a mirror {{with a small}} unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target {{by looking at the}} reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target. They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the <b>tangent</b> and elevation <b>screws</b> so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target. [...] This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target. The flashes were produced by a keying mechanism that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever {{at the back of the}} instrument. If the sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station. If the sun was behind the sender, the sighting rod was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station. The U. S. Signal Corps heliograph mirror did not tilt. This type produced flashes by a shutter mounted on a second tripod (Fig 4).|$|R
