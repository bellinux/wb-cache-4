5|$|<b>The</b> <b>winery</b> {{had been}} founded by both {{his father and}} his {{grandfather}}, Hermann Schnaufer, in 1919, shortly after World War I. Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> was run by his father alone. When his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> offered wine imports, sparkling wines, and a distillery for wine and liqueur. The distribution channel worked with agents and sales offices throughout Germany.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|He {{sold the}} {{building}} at a low price that year, to Charles Carpy, who deeded the property to the California Wine Association. The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia brothers of San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced sacramental wine under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of <b>the</b> <b>winery.</b> The house burned down around 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. <b>The</b> <b>winery</b> was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of <b>the</b> <b>winery.</b> Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} causes for the {{perception}} in wine faults, including poor hygiene at <b>the</b> <b>winery,</b> excessive or insufficient {{exposure of the}} wine to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended maceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine, the use of dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging {{and the use of}} poor quality corks. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>winery,</b> other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage of the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.|$|E

25|$|Traditional hand {{harvesting}} {{of whole}} bunches has been increasingly {{challenged by the}} harvesting machine for dry white wines, an economic choice but not always a qualitative one.
