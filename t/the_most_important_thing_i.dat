500|$|In January 1999, Javie was {{the only}} one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not {{reporting}} income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. [...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E
500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} said that Watson's untrained tenor voice {{is not up to}} operatic standards; Rupert Christiansen, music critic of The Daily Telegraph has, for instance, called him a [...] "karaoke crooner". Watson has responded that it [...] "oesn't bother me. Seven years ago {{classical}} crossover didn't exist – putting Italian lyrics to pop songs in a big ballsy way. Now every bugger's doing it. I've transcended all that bickering and bitching." [...] Watson's career ambition is [...] "ongevity, that's <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> want to be a musical force for a good long while." [...] On 5 June 2008 Watson released his autobiography Finding My Voice.|$|E
6000|$|He didn't {{tell her}} again this time, {{as he had}} told her when, on the {{occasion}} of their walk together in New York, she expressed an inconsequent hope that his fortune as a rejected contributor would take a turn--he didn't remark to her once more that she was a delightful being; he only went on (as if her revulsion were a matter of course) to explain everything he could, so that she might as soon as possible know him better and see how completely she could trust him. [...] "That was, at bottom, the reason I came here. The essay in question is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have done {{in the way of a}} literary attempt, and I determined to give up the game or to persist, according as I should be able to bring it to the light or not. The other day I got a letter from the editor of the Rational Review, telling me that he should be very happy to print it, that he thought it very remarkable, and that he should be glad to hear from me again. He shall hear from me again--he needn't be afraid! It contained a good many of the opinions I have expressed to you, and a good many more besides. I really believe it will attract some attention. At any rate, the simple fact that it is to be published makes an era in my life. This will seem pitiful to you, no doubt, who publish yourself, have been before the world these several years, and are flushed with every kind of triumph; but to me it's simply a tremendous affair. It makes me believe I may do something; it has changed the whole way I look at my future. I have been building castles in the air, and I have put you in the biggest and fairest of them. That's a great change, and, as I say, it's really why I came on." ...|$|E
