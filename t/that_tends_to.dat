A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the Cherokee and Creek {{had begun to}} compete for the same {{resources}} and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap. The Creek lost, ceding the Blood Mountain area to the Cherokee, who considered it a holy place. Archaeological evidence has been discovered <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> back the story of the battle, but the date of the battle and its participants are still disputed.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E

50|$|Mock pleats {{can be made}} by {{alternating}} stitches <b>that</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> recede (such as purl or slip wyif), stitches {{that lie}} flat (such as seed or plissé) and stitches <b>that</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> advance (such as knit and slip wyib) along the backward fold, the flat face and the forward fold, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five}} years after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{the mode}} of {{deformation}} is controlled {{not only by the}} amount of stress, but also by the distribution of strain and strain associated features. Whichever mode of deformation ultimately occurs {{is the result of a}} competition between processes <b>that</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> localize strain, such as fracture propagation, and relaxational processes, such as annealing, <b>that</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> delocalize strain.|$|R
5|$|Good field {{characteristics}} for Suillus luteus {{include the}} slimy brown cap, glandular dots {{on the upper}} stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is Suillus granulatus, which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. Suillus granulatus is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, Suillus luteus {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related Suillus grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus may look comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S.pseudobrevipes also have partials veils, but lack the distinctive ring of S.luteus. S.cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be brownish rather than purplish.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana {{became a}} judge of tournament bouts in February 2004, {{only a year}} after his retirement, a role for which elders {{normally}} have to wait at least four years. After {{the election of the}} Association's Board of Directors in February 2008, the Association appointed Takanohana as , replacing former yokozuna Chiyonofuji (Kokonoe-oyakata) who was elected to serve the Board as a director. For an organization <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> follow seniority over achievement in its organization appointment, it was highly unusual for them to place a 35-year-old to such an influential position. However both former yokozuna, Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji whom Takanohana is often compared to, served a stint as Associate Manager of Judging prior to their becoming the Board director. In February 2009 he was moved from the judging department to the jungyō (regional tour) department, a less high-profile position.|$|E

5|$|Through rich {{cultural}} exchange with China and Korea {{facilitated by the}} proximity to the continent, iron manufacture had been practiced on Kyūshū (Saikaidō) since earliest times. Swordsmiths were active from the Heian period onwards. Initially the Yamato school's influence is evident all over the island. However, distance from other swordmaking centers such as Yamato or Yamashiro caused the workmanship to remain static as smiths maintained old traditions and shunned innovations. Kyūshū blades, therefore, demonstrate a classic workmanship. The old Kyūshū smiths are represented by Bungo Yukihira from Bungo Province, the Miike school active in Chikugo Province and the Naminohira school of Satsuma Province. Two old blades, one by Miike Mitsuyo and the other by Bungo Yukihira, and five later blades from the 14th century, have been designated as national treasures from Kyūshū. They originate from three provinces: Chikugo, Chikuzen, and Bungo. Generally Kyūshū blades are characterized by a sugata that looks old having a wide shinogi. The jihada is mokume-hada <b>that</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> masame-hada or becomes ayasugi-hada. The jigana is soft and there are ji-nie and chikei present. The hamon is small midare made up of nie and based on suguha. The edge of the hamon starts just above the hamachi.|$|E
