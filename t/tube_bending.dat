To {{assess the}} {{adequacy}} of the position of the tracheal tube cuff and tracheal tube tip in the recently introduced preformed oral Microcuff paediatric endotracheal tube (PET) using the manufacturers recommendations for Microcuff tracheal tube size selection. Methods. With Hospital Ethics Committee approval and informed parental consent, the tracheas of children from birth to adolescence were orally intubated with the preformed oral Microcuff PET. First, the position of the tracheal tube's intubation depth mark in relation to the vocal cords was assessed. Second, the distance ‘tracheal tube tip-to-carina' was endoscopically measured with the patient supine and the head in a neutral position and the tube placed with the centre mark at the lower incisors or alveolar ridge. Results. A total of 166 children aged from 0. 1 to 16. 4 yr (median 5. 9 yr) were studied. In five patients the intubation depth mark was above (5 mm each), in 22 patients at the level of and in the remaining 139 patients below the vocal cords. No endobronchial intubation occurred. In four patients the distance ‘tracheal tube tip-to-carina' was smaller than the safety margin to prevent endobronchial intubation during head-neck flexion. Conclusion. The new oral preformed cuffed tracheal tubes allow safe placement in almost all patients when inserted according to the <b>tube</b> <b>bend.</b> The critically low tube tip and the high cuff positions in a few tubes when placed according to the <b>tube</b> <b>bend</b> requires clinical alertnes...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>tube</b> <b>bending</b> {{involves}} using mechanical force to push stock material pipe or tubing against a die, forcing the pipe or tube {{to conform to}} the shape of the die. Often, stock tubing is held firmly in place while the end is rotated and rolled around the die. Other forms of processing including pushing stock through rollers that bend it into a simple curve. For some <b>tube</b> <b>bending</b> processing, a mandrel is placed inside the tube to prevent collapsing. The tube is also held in tension by a wiper die to prevent any creasing during stress. A wiper die is usually made of a softer alloy i.e. aluminum, brass to avoid scratching or damaging the material being bent.|$|E

40|$|Tube {{fittings}} {{are widely}} used in the pressure vessel industry. Current research on tube fittings serves to determine means of decreasing the cost and increasing the efficiency of their manufacture. With this motivation, several new tube forming processes have been proposed in recent years. The current study focuses on the finite element simulation of two new manufacturing processes for tube fittings; i. e. hydroforming and tube push-bending. For tube hydroforming, used to produce T and Y joints, there is a working range defined by the combination of internal pressure and axial load. To ensure that a satisfactory product is obtained, {{it is essential that}} the loading path be inside the working range. The working range for several tube hydroforming models are predicted, and the results are validated with existing theoretical and experimental values. The new <b>tube</b> push <b>bending</b> process has the advantage that <b>tube</b> <b>bends</b> with a small bending radius can be produced. In this study, finite element simulations are carried out to demonstrate this advantage. The spring-back and material waste factors are determined through simulation, as well as the maximum axial load.

The study ends with some conclusions about the suitability of finite element simulations in tube forming processes, and with some suggestions for further research...|$|R

In this study, by using the energy principle, combined with analytical and finite element (FE) numerical methods, an energy-based wrinkling prediction model for thin-walled <b>tube</b> <b>bending</b> is developed. A segment shell model is proposed to consider the critical wrinkling region, which captures the deformation features of the <b>tube</b> <b>bending</b> process.

40|$|Cardiac {{development}} is a complex morphogenetic process initiated as bilateral cardiogenic mesoderm is specified at {{both sides of the}} gastrulating embryo. Soon thereafter, these cardiogenic cells fuse at the embryonic midline configuring a symmetrical linear cardiac tube. Left/right bilateral asymmetry is first detected in the forming heart as the cardiac <b>tube</b> <b>bends</b> to the right, and subsequently, atrial and ventricular chambers develop. Molecular signals emanating from the node confer distinct left/right signalling pathways that ultimately lead to activation of the homeobox transcription factor Pitx 2 in the left side of distinct embryonic organ anlagen, including the developing heart. Asymmetric expression of Pitx 2 has therefore been reported during different cardiac developmental stages, and genetic deletion of Pitx 2 provided evidence of key regulatory roles of this transcription factor during cardiogenesis and thus congenital heart diseases.
