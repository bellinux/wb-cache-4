Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected,</b> {{there was a sense of}} irritation. We raised a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E

[...] He continued: [...] " [...] were slower off the start <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> which was nice." [...] Referring to Cambridge's lead at Hammersmith Bridge, their number seven Steve Fowler said [...] "we were feeling good but we should have closed the door there and then. [...] We should have killed them on the bend." [...] Cambridge cox Probert conceded to his counterpart Liz Chick: [...] "she steered very well." [...] Oxford coach Gröbler stated: [...] "It was wonderful. [...] Both crews ... were very good [...] and so disciplined. [...] I like these university students." [...] Cambridge coach Wilson lamented: [...] "we failed to capitalise at Hammersmith and they grew in confidence thereafter." ...|$|E

[...] "To be frank, the government granted licenses much earlier <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> and we were caught by surprise", said the editor of one private paper. Several papers that have not yet seen the light of day are backed by existing media groups.|$|E

"Perhaps so," [...] replied Stanley; [...] "I {{hope they}} won't try their mettle {{on each other}} sooner <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect.</b> Not that I care a whit {{for any of the}} men having a round or two now and then and be done with it; but this fellow seems to `nurse his wrath to keep it warm.'

You see, there are a good {{many people in this}} country and only two of us, {{and it will be a}} lot harder for them to keep from {{sniffing}} and snorting than for us to do it. So it's my opinion that if <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to get along in a good-humored and friendly way, which is the only decent way of living, we've got to hold up our end of the business a little higher <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> other people to hold up theirs." ...|$|R

30|$|In CFB and NFL, the {{distributions}} of scoring balances are similar, but the shape for CFB is broader than for NFL, suggesting that CFB competitions are less balanced than NFL competitions. This is likely {{a result of}} the broader range of skill differences among teams at the college level, as compared to the professionals. Like CFB and NFL, NHL games also exhibit substantially more blowouts and fewer ties than expected, which is consistent with a heterogeneous distribution of team skills. Surprisingly, however, NBA games exhibit less variance in the final relative lead size <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> for perfectly balanced games, a pattern we will revisit in the following section.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Security is an {{essential}} part of network communications. Interestingly enough, these systems are designed to provide open access across vast networked environment. With the increasing popularity of wireless network, the security issue for mobile users could be even more serious <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect.</b> In this paper, we discuss SSTCC, a general framework of a distributed security management system against cloning mobile phones, and describe an implementation of its safe and secure on-line phone bill system, which we refer to as SETWeb, using distributed objects techniques (i. e., manager and agents). We also show how an ISO Formal Description Technique (LOTOS) is used to specify and validate the system. Key words: network management, security, telecommunications, Web. 1...|$|R

40|$|We present {{principles}} for tunnel-juhction (TJ) design optimization {{for use in}} intracavity contacted long-wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (LW-VCSELs). Using the WKB approximation, we find that layer thicknesses of 10 nm on the n++ side and 10 mn on the p++ side are large enough to maximize quantum tunneling probability and small enough to yield low optical free-carrier absorption loss. We also conjecture that our experimental test structures and actual devices have far lower active acceptor concentration <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> based on an analytical model. Finally, we calculate the necessary doping levels to enable single-mode operation of LW-VCSELs and incorporate these conditions into a complete optimized model of our VCSELs. Based on optimal I-V curves, <b>we</b> can <b>expect</b> an increase in single-mode output power from 2 to 3. 5 mW...|$|R
