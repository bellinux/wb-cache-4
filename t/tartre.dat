50|$|Régis, Jartoux and Fr. Ernbert Fridelli, {{from the}} Austrian Tyrol, {{set out for}} the northeast. In two expeditions (8 May - 17 December 1709; 22 July - 14 December 1710) they made the map of Liaodong and Manchuria, and during the {{interval}} drew the province of Chi-li, in which Beijing is situated. In 1711 Father Francis Cardoso, a Portuguese, and the Augustinian Father Guillaume Bonjour, the only non-Jesuit, joined the geographers. Régis and Cardoso drew the map of Shandong; Jartoux, Fridelli and Bonjour traversed Mongolia as far as Lake Baikal in the north and the Zunghar Khanate to the west. The year 1712 brought a new reinforcement; Frs. Vincent de <b>Tartre</b> and Cardoso made the maps of Shanxi and Shaanxi (1712-14), Jiangxi and Guangdong, and Guangxi; Frs. Anne-Marie de Mailla, Roman Hinderer, an Alsatian, and Régis laboured (1712-15) on the maps of Hunan, Jiangnan, Zhejiang, Fujian and the Island of Formosa. Meanwhile, Fridelli and Bonjour were at Sichuan, where Fr. Bonjour died on 23 December 1714, and was replaced by Régis on 24 March 1715. He assisted Fridelli with the maps of Yunnan, Guizhou and Huguang. After ten years' labour the new map of China was completed on 1 January 1717. The fundamental method employed was the exact measurement of distances from which was obtained the longitude and latitude of places; this, supplemented and controlled by the observations of the meridians of the sun and the polar stars, directly gave the latitude. The missionaries were sometimes assisted by the observation of eclipses of the moon and the satellites of Jupiter, of which more perfect process they desired to make use to obtain longitudes, but conditions did not permit.|$|E

40|$|Aims : Inhibition of {{potassium}} hydrogen tartrate (KHT) crystallization by carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is {{tested in a}} model solution and in wines. Tartaric acid salt crystallization risk is assessed by computing the supersaturation, saturation temperature and excess KHT {{with respect to the}} saturation equilibrium using MEXTAR® (Mesure de l’EXces de <b>TARtre)</b> software. Materials and results : Firstly, the time for crystals to appear was recorded by monitoring the conductivity in a model solution and in a wine, and the inhibition ratio was computed. At 11, 5 °C, 0, 5 mg. L- 1 CMC inhibited KHT crystallization. The inhibitory effect increased exponentially with increasing CMC concentration and was several times greater than that of polysaccharides and polyphenols, the protective colloids in wine (Gerbaud et al., 1997). At 2 °C, 30 mg. L- 1 CMC had the same inhibitory effect than 10 mg. L- 1 at 11. 5 °C. Secondly, 20 red and white wines were refrigerated for 3 weeks at - 4 °C with CMC or metatartaric acid. Results show that the addition of 20 mg. L- 1 CMC has an inhibitory effect at least equivalent to 100 mg. L- 1 metatartaric acid. Furthermore, for 10 wines preheated for 8 days at 30 °C and then refrigerated for 2 months at 0 °C, 5 and 20 mg. L- 1 CMC maintains its inhibitory efficiency, unlike metatartaric acid which is hydrolysed Significance and impact of the study : The OIV-OENO 366 - 2009 and OIV-OENO 02 / 2008 resolutions recently authorized the use of CMC to prevent tartaric acid salt precipitation. With no impact on health, and stable under heating and in acid solution, CMC is an efficient candidate for tartaric stabilization. The optimal concentration of 20 mg. L- 1 (2 g. hL- 1) should however be adapted to local wine storage conditions and KHT crystallization risk...|$|E
40|$|Achievement and the {{experiences}} of women in secondary school mathematics have been well documented in the research literature (e. g., Benbow 2 ̆ 6 Stanley, 1980, 1983; <b>Tartre</b> 2 ̆ 6 Fennema, 1995; Sherman, 1982; Ryckman 2 ̆ 6 Peckham, 1987; Keller 2 ̆ 6 Dauenheimer, 2003). With respect to achievement, the research literature primarily focuses on how women are deficient to men (e. g., Benbow 2 ̆ 6 Stanley, 1980, 1983) and the roles affective attributes (e. g., Sherman, 1982; Fennema, Petersen, Carpenter 2 ̆ 6 Lubinski, 1990) and stereotype threat (e. g., Quinn 2 ̆ 6 Spencer, 2001; Steele 2 ̆ 6 Aronson, 1995) have played in women’s deficiencies. Despite the perspective and nature of this research, there are, however, women who have achieved at extraordinarily high levels in the secondary mathematics classroom. It is important to examine this historical research as it has impacted the views of teachers, researchers, and media with regard to female mathematics students’ opportunities. By reflecting upon the research literature and its far reaching impacts, high-achieving women in mathematics can begin to reverse the perceptions that limit their opportunities. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to explore, through {{the experiences}} and stories relayed by the study’s participants, how young women might negotiate the (historic all male) mathematics domain. Employing a qualitative research designed within a phenomenological framework and analyzed through a combination of postmodern and standpoint feminisms, I examined the stories of four undergraduate female students who were identified as being high-achieving in secondary school mathematics. These young women, by reflecting upon their secondary school experiences, and by reflecting upon their experiences within the context of the existing research literature, not only identified the aspects of their lives they felt had the greatest impact upon their opportunities but also examined their personal definitions of success and the impacts their gender had on their (socially defined) achievements within secondary school mathematics...|$|E
40|$|This article {{brings up}} the point that 3 -D spatial {{visualization}} skills are vital to graphics education. Instructors of graphics education, {{even though they have}} highly advanced spatial skills, rarely have the proper training on what spatial skills are or how the development of spatial skills takes place. As a result one must try to {{have a better understanding of}} spatial abilities. There are many interpretations as to what spatial skills really are and there is in therefore no one universal definition. As a way to better understand spatial abilities, Maier places them into five categories. The categories are spatial perception, spatial visualization, mental rotations, spatial rotations, and spatial orientation. These categories are vast. As a result of their vastness many of the categories overlap. Another step towards better understanding spatial skills involves differentiating how spatial skills are used while completing a task. <b>Tartre</b> makes a classification for how spatial skills are used while performing a task. The spatial skills are either used as spatial visualization that involves mentally moving the object, or as spatial orientation, which involves mentally moving the object. If the task involves spatial visualization then mental rotation can take place, which involves the entire object, or mental transformation can occur, which only involves part of an object. Visual thinking is a way to understand spatial skills. McKim offers the viewpoint that visual thinking occurs by three kinds of imagery. They are what one sees, what one can imagine, and what one can draw. All of these images interact with one another. Spatial skills are developed primarily in three different stages. This can be see be Piaget's theory on development. In the first stage, two dimensional, topological, skills are acquired. In the second stage, an understanding of 3 -D objects, projective skills, from different viewpoints is achieved. Finally in the third stage, there is an understanding of area, volume, distance, translation, rotation and reflection, which is combined with projective skills. Spatial skills are evaluated in a variety of ways. There are tests that assess a person's projective skill level. Examples of these would be the Mental Cutting Test and the Differential Aptitude Test: Spatial Relation. Other tests assess mental rotation. Examples of mental rotation tests are the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test and the Mental Rotation Test. Results of these evaluations show mixed results as to whether there are gender differences in spatial skills. In order to enhance spatial skills, one must not only work with 3 -D images, but they must also use concrete models and sketching. Overall I thought this article was very informative. It presented the information in a clear and concise manner. I summarized the information that I thought was especially useful for this class. The article really made me think how important it is not only to have spatial skills, but also to have an understanding of them...|$|E
40|$|Une nappe d'eaux fossiles à grande profondeur (800 à 2 700 mètres) a été mise en {{exploitation}} dans le Sud-Tunisien pour alimenter une usine d'osmose inverse située à Gabès ayant une production de 15 000 m 3 /jour, afin de lutter contre la désertification par irrigation et d'assurer le chauffage de serres pour la production de primeurs. La grande dureté (TH de l'ordre de 100 à 140 °F) de ces eaux géothermales a pour conséquence le colmatage rapide des conduites de distribution : 40 à 50 tonnes de <b>tartre</b> par forage, constitué essentiellement de carbonate de calcium, précipitent chaque année. Ce <b>tartre</b> est constitué d'aragonite comme le montrent la microscopie électronique à balayage et la diffraction des rayons X. Une technique électrochimique, la chronoélectrogravimétrie, permet d'étudier l'inhibition de l'entartrage par des composés de la famille des phosphates inorganiques, des phosphonates organiques et des polycarboxylates. La concentration efficace de chacun de ces inhibiteurs agissant par effet de seuil a été déterminée : {{elle est}} de l'ordre de 1, 1 à 1, 5 mg. l- 1 pour l'eau du forage de EL HAMMA. Un essai sur le site de EL MANSOURA a été effectué en privilégiant un inhibiteur produit industriellement dans le Sud-Tunisien, le triphosphate de sodium. A la concentration de 1 mg. l- 1 il évite l'entartrage du système de refroidissement de type cascade - piscines et des conduites de distribution. Deep fossil waters {{are used in}} Southern Tunisia (Gabès, Kébili, Tozeur) for the Gabès reverse osmosis plant, which delivers a flow rate of 15 000 m 3 /day for irrigation and for heating greenhouses used {{for the production of}} early fruits and vegetables. Drilling depths vary between 800 and 2 700 meters. Water emerges under a pressure of ca. 20 bars and has a temperature between 50 and 73 °C. Mean flow rate is 7 800 m 3 /day. Intake water at the Gabès plant has a salinity of 3. 3 g. l- 1; after reverse osmosis the salinity is less than 0. 1 g. l- 1. Water used for irrigation has to be cooled. Geothermal waters are characterized by high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulphate and chloride. Bicarbonate anions are present at limited concentrations (approx. 2. 10 - 3 mol. l- 1) that are, however, sufficient for the formation of large quantities of scale - 40 to 50 tons per year for each drilling. At the outlet of the drill hole, pressure decreases strongly, liberating carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Water pH increases and the following equilibrium is displaced to the right, with scale precipitation : Ca 2 + + 2 HCO 3 -CO 2 (g) + CaCO 3 (s) + H 2 OScale precipitation has two consequences :- the plugging of distribution pipes: a 85 % reduction of the pipe has been observed, after four years, for an initial diameter of 15 cm; - water cooling installations such as cooling towers or pool systems are blocked by large quantities of scale, which have to be removed regularly. Scales have been analysed through inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and thermogravimetry: calcium carbonate may represent, depending on the origin of the drilling water, 60 to 95 % by weight of the solid. Iron oxides, silica, calcium phosphate and aluminum are present. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction show that calcium carbonate precipitates in the form of aragonite. This is due to two reasons: the temperature at the drilling outlet is greater than 60 °C and the high magnesium concentration favours aragonite formation. Scale inhibition is possible through the use of certain chemicals such as phosphates, organic phosphonates and polycarboxylates. Chronoelectrogravimetry was used as the experimental method to determine the inhibitor concentration able to suppress scale precipitation. Dissolved oxygen is electrochemically reduced on a gold electrode; hydroxide anions are produced {{in the vicinity of the}} electrode and calcium carbonate precipitates according to: 4 Ca 2 + + 4 HCO 3 - + O 2 + 4 e -> 4 CaCO 3 (s) + 2 H 2 OThe gold electrode is deposited on the quartz disk of a recording microbalance. The electrode is polarized at - 1 V/SCE with a three-electrode potentiostatic device and the weight of CaCO 3 deposited is recorded versus time. Four inhibitors have been studied :- PERMATREAT 191, which is the sodium salt of aminotris(methylenephosphonic) acid N(CH 2 COONa) 3; - a proprietary organic phosphonate with high resistance to chlorine oxidation (DEQUEST 6004); - phosphonobutanetricarboxylic acid (DEQUEST 7000, BAYHIBIT-AM); - a copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylamidopropanesulfonic acid (FERROPHOS 5248). Breakthrough effects are obtained in the case of EL HAMMA water for the following concentrations: PERMATREAT 191 : 1. 1 mg. l- 1; DEQUEST 6004 : 1. 5 mg. l- 1; DEQUEST 7000 : 1. 3 mg. l- 1; FERROPHOS 5248 : 1. 4 mg. l- 1. These concentrations are low and, as a consequence, these inhibitors can be used for antiscale action even with high water flow rates. A field experiment was carried out on the EL MANSOURA drilling where water is cooled in three pools (input water: 5 184 m 3 /day, temperature: 60 °C). For economical reasons the chosen inhibitor was sodium triphosphate Na 5 P 3 O 10, which is produced industrially in Southern Tunisia. By chronoelectrogravimetry it has been shown that, with EL MANSOURA water, a breakthrough effect is obtained with a sodium triphosphate concentration of 0. 75 mg. l- 1. A dosing pump was used to inject sodium triphosphate in such a way that the inhibitor concentration would be 1 mg. l- 1 in one of three pools, the two others not being treated. After four months a scale deposit of 23 cm was obtained in the untreated pools and the pipe diameter was reduced by 39 %. In the treated pool scale deposit was not observed and the pipe diameter remained unchanged. In the untreated basins, examination of scale with electron scanning microscopy revealed that it was aragonite; in the treated basin, the precipitate was amorphous and an X-ray diffraction pattern with no characteristic bands was obtained. Some algal development was observed in the pool due to phosphate addition but this development was not a nuisance after the four month period. However, it could be suppressed by the use of an organic phosphonate or polycarboxylate as scale inhibitor...|$|E
