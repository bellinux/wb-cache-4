Current studies reflected only a limited examination of <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> within university settings. This study investigated the current methods of providing <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> and factors influencing <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> through examination of the current <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> services offered within the College of Education (CoE). This study focused on three research questions pertaining to the study of personal computer (PC) related <b>technical</b> <b>support.</b> First, what are the primary elements of PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> and how can they improve PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> within the NIU College of Education? Second, what are the characteristics of the current PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> environment within the NIU College of Education? Finally, what PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> information can be derived from the NIU College of Education Technology-lab Work Orders?The study revealed a comprehensive list of elements pertaining to PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support,</b> characteristics of the current support environment within the NIU College of Education, and information regarding the number and type of problems within the college based on a one-year sample of work orders. These findings served as the basis for several conclusions drawn from this study three of which are as follows. First, PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> is in its infancy whereas PC technology is in its adolescence. Upgrades and obsolescence drive many support needs within organizations. Therefore, until the "flavor-of-the-week" attitude within the computing industry subsides, PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> entities will need to continually upgrade methods of training and support. Second, organization members will find their own PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> solutions if one is not provided through formal channels. This statement also relates to the organizational culture and the perceived effectiveness of the formal support entity. If this entity does not suit their needs, they will obtain their own "hired guns" and create different forms of PC-related support solutions. Finally, the College of Education needs to seriously assess its needs for PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> and provide adequate service levels to ensure effective applications of computing technology...|$|R

The proposed solution utilises the Hadoop distributed data processing platform, extended ecosystem and parallelised clustering techniques using the Mahout library. It is envisaged that if such a solution was deployed in commercial environments with large <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> datasets, updated on a daily basis, it would expedite case resolution and accuracy to maximise daily closure rates by providing similar case resolutions to staff when a new <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> case is received. If achieved, the reduction of resolution time would also ultimately aid <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> teams to increase customer satisfaction and prevent churn. Furthermore this solution could also be used to identify the most problematic product features and highlight staff knowledge gaps leading to more directed staff training programmes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Effective public {{policies}} {{are needed to}} support appropriate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) to ensure adequate child growth and development, especially in low and middle income countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to: (i) capture stakeholder networks in relation to funding and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> for IYCF policy across five countries in South Asia (i. e. Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan); and (ii) understand how stakeholder networks differed between countries, and identify common actors and their patterns in network engagement across the region. Methods The Net-Map method, which is an interview-based mapping technique to visualise and capture connections among different stakeholders that collaborate towards achieving a focused goal, has been used to map funding and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> networks in all study sites. Our study was conducted at the national level in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, as well as in selected states or provinces in India and Pakistan during 2013 – 2014. We analysed the network data using a social network analysis software (NodeXL). Results The number of stakeholders identified as providing <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> was higher than the number of stakeholders providing funding support, across all study sites. India (New Delhi site – national level) site had the highest number of influential stakeholders for both funding (43) and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> (86) activities. Among all nine study sites, India (New Delhi – national level) and Sri Lanka had the highest number of participating government stakeholders (22) in their respective funding networks. Sri Lanka also had the highest number of participating government stakeholders for <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> (34) among all the study sites. Government stakeholders are more engaged in <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> activities compared with their involvement in funding activities. The United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) were highly engaged stakeholders for both funding and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> activities across all study sites. Conclusion International stakeholders were highly involved in both the funding and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> activities related to IYCF practices across these nine study sites. Government stakeholders received more support for funding and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> activities from other stakeholders compared with the support that they offered. Stakeholders were, in general, more engaged for <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> activities compared with the funding activities...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the process of <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> work {{and the role of}} {{knowledge}} in enhancing the productivity of such work. We develop the concepts of problem-solving tasks and moves to describe <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> work, while using call resolution time and problem escalation as measures of productivity. Using hierarchical log-linear modeling, we establish the link between problem-solving moves and productivity. We find that the mix of moves exercised in <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> strongly depends on the formulation of tasks by those requesting support. Because the formulation of tasks is performed by users, knowledge management initiatives must target users as well as support providers to have the desired impact on productivity. <b>Technical</b> <b>Support,</b> Call Center, Diagnostic Problem Solving, Distributed Cognition, Knowledge Management, Log-Linear Modeling...|$|R
