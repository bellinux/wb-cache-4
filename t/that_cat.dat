5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal <b>that</b> <b>cat</b> populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|In the Edo {{period and}} afterwards, {{it has become}} {{generally}} thought <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> raised domestically would turn into nekomata as they grow old, and the aforementioned nekomata of the mountains {{have come to be}} interpreted as <b>cats</b> <b>that</b> have run away and came to live in the mountains.

60|$|Far from imagining <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> exist 'in order' {{to catch}} mice well, Darwinism supposes <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> exist 'because' they catch mice well--mousing being not the end, but the condition, of their existence.

25|$|Although it {{was long}} {{generally}} thought <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> were unresponsive to music, {{recent studies have shown}} that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies.

Other findings include age-related sensitivity (older and younger cats were more responsive than middle aged cats).|$|R

The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away.

Again it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause that the King Majesty’s Ship at his coming forth of Denmark, had a contrary wind to the rest of his Ships, then being in his company, which thing was most strange and true, as the King’s Majesty acknowledges [...] – Daemonologie, Newes from Scotland ...|$|E
2500|$|Statistics {{generated}} {{by the state of}} Ohio document <b>that</b> <b>Cat</b> bites are about 20% of all animal bites per year.

25|$|Folk beliefs <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> {{can cause}} strange {{phenomena}} {{are not limited}} to Japan. For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, it is said <b>that</b> a <b>cat,</b> after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching them. Because it is said <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since it is said that their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, it is said <b>that</b> when a <b>cat</b> looks up at the moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, it should be killed on the spot.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> experience visual illusions and that a non-human animal can see illusory motion. In three videos we show cats reacting with hunting behavior when watching the Rotating Snakes illusion. This is taken to mean <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> see illusory motion in this image due to the propensity of cats to pursue movement. This is further supported by a survey where 29 % of the respondents answered <b>that</b> their <b>cat</b> reacted to the illusion. A number of preferential looking experiments were also indicative of cats experiencing the illusion, but not conclusively so...|$|R

2500|$|Those at {{the highest}} risk of {{contracting}} a disease from a cat are those with behaviors that include: being licked, sharing food, sharing kithchen utensils, kissing, and sleeping with a cat. The very young, the elderly {{and those who are}} immunocompromised increase their risk of becoming infected when sleeping with their cats (and dogs). [...] The CDC recommends <b>that</b> <b>cat</b> owners not allow a cat to lick your face because it can result in disease transmission. If someone is licked on their face, mucous membranes or an open wound, the risk for infection is reduced if the area is immediately washed with soap and water. Maintaining the health of the animal by regular inspection for fleas and ticks, scheduling deworming medications along with veterinary exams will also reduce the risk of acquiring a feline zoonosis.|$|E
2500|$|On July 22, 2010, Michael Ausiello {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>Cat</b> Grant, a gossip {{columnist for}} the Daily Planet in the comic books, would be appearing as Clark's new partner during season ten. Ausiello stated that Grant would act more as a [...] "comedic foil" [...] for Clark, and {{is not intended to}} interrupt the relationship he has with Lois. Instead, Grant will act as Lois's professional rival, and is considered by the producers to be her opposite. Keri Lynn Pratt, who portrays Grant, stated that her character will have a crush on Clark, which will annoy Lois more than threaten her. Pratt described her characters motivations: [...] "Cat really believes in what she's working on and her message. She just really wants to get that through and have everyone on the same page as her. She kind of loses track of the big picture".|$|E
2500|$|Maria Bustillos {{considers}} cat videos to be [...] "the crystallisation of {{all that}} human beings love about cats", with their [...] "natural beauty and majesty" [...] being [...] "just one tiny slip away from total humiliation", which Bustillos sees as a mirror of the human condition. When {{the creator of the}} World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, was asked for an example of a popular use of the internet that he would never had predicted, he answered [...] "Kittens". A 2014 paper argues that cats' [...] "unselfconsciousness" [...] is rare in an age of hyper-surveillance, and cat photos appeal to people as it lets them imagine [...] "the possibility of freedom from surveillance", while presenting the power of controlling that surveillance as unproblematic.

2500|$|Perone's {{assessment}} of the album's composition indicates a remove from [...] "just about anything else {{that was going on}} in 1966 pop music". Composer Philip Glass observed: [...] "Listening to it today, it is, perhaps, easier to see why {{it was one of the}} defining moments of its time... its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time-all these elements give Pet Sounds a freshness that, 30 years later, is immediately there for the listener." [...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is supposed to be about, you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps.... Once the Beach Boys let <b>that</b> <b>cat</b> out of the bag, the whole ship of rock sailed to new ports.'" ...|$|E

50|$|In a {{more recent}} study, it has been {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> falling from higher places would suffer more severe injuries otherwise:In a study performed in 1987 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> who fall from less than six stories, and are still alive, have greater injuries than cats who fall from higher than six stories. It has been proposed that this might happen because cats reach terminal velocity after righting themselves (see below) at about five stories, and after this point they are no longer accelerating and can no longer sense that they are falling, which causes them to relax, leading to less severe injuries than in cats who have fallen from less than six stories. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is <b>that</b> <b>cats</b> who die in falls {{are less likely to be}} brought to a veterinarian than injured cats, and thus many of the cats killed in falls from higher buildings are not reported in studies of the subject.|$|R
