5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is high enough <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> the circuit breaker then disruption of service will occur.

5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it <b>to</b> <b>trip.</b> By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

25|$|Cash fares (single-use Compass tickets) {{purchased}} at ticket machines in stations on Sea Island include an AddFare of $5.00 {{on top of}} the normal fare. This charge is also added <b>to</b> <b>trips</b> initiated on Sea Island that travel east beyond Sea Island using Compass Card Stored Value or DayPasses. It is not applied <b>to</b> <b>trips</b> using monthly passes, nor <b>to</b> <b>trips</b> using DayPasses or single-use Compass tickets which were purchased outside the Airport Zone. The AddFare came into effect on January 18, 2010. The revenue collected from the AddFare goes back to TransLink.|$|R
50|$|Every year, {{the school}} organizes several <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> {{countries}} abroad. Recent trips include Kenya in 2013, India in 2014, and China in 2015. These trips were organized {{in collaboration with}} a Canadian social enterprise called Me <b>to</b> We. Other <b>trips</b> include annual ski <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Switzerland, annual Omrah <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Mecca, annual <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Jordan, and annual <b>trips</b> <b>to</b> Cyprus for students enrolled in Biology IB.|$|R
5|$|Dual Destinies {{features}} animated cutscenes {{produced by}} the animation studio Bones, which were directed by Seto at Capcom and Kenji Nagasaki at Bones. The scripts for these were drafted by Yamazaki, and included characters' lines {{as well as the}} general events and backgrounds for each scene. After the scripts were written, they were sent to Nagasaki, who drew storyboards for the scenes. When boarding the sequences, he added suggestions for details and nuances; for instance, in the script for one scene, Athena was going <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> and fall over, while Nagasaki suggested and boarded her tumbling down stairs, and added a guard character for her to interact with {{at the end of the}} scene to emphasize how painful the fall had been. After finalizing the scene, the team at Bones worked on the background art; while the courtrooms and defendant lobbies are shown in-game, the courthouse's stairway and main hall had not been shown before, and had to be designed specifically for the cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E
5|$|On the way, {{they start}} the car after Meg puts mousetraps {{for the big}} mouse. Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food {{so they have to}} {{distract}} them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run out of gas. The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it. Then he tries to get on the celling only to fall off and lois catch him then says that he getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs. Peter shows and made guns that he uses the pipes from the city's water irrigation system to make guns and other weapons, outraging the citizens.|$|E

25|$|On 13 October 2015, {{train service}} was {{disrupted}} between Farrer Park and Hougang {{for more than}} half an hour due to a power fault.
