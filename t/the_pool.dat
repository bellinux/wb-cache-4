5|$|Cardiff Blues {{had been}} the only team to finish <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008–09 season, which saw them given top seeding for the quarter-finals.

5|$|Leicester {{lost two}} games during <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> stage, but amassed {{sufficient}} points to finish {{as the top}} side in <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and to be seeded fourth, which meant they were given {{the last of the}} home draws against the fifth-seeded side, Bath.

40|$|Three {{individual}} formalinized stool specimens {{from each}} of 123 patients were pooled and examined for ova and parasites. Results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>pooled</b> specimens were compared with those obtained with the three individual specimens used to make <b>the</b> <b>pooled</b> specimens. Of 123 sets examined, 92 were negative and 31 were positive for ova and parasites. <b>The</b> <b>pooled</b> specimens were positive and all individual specimens were negative eight times, whereas <b>the</b> <b>pooled</b> specimens were negative and the individual specimens were positive twice.

30|$|Results Twenty-one studies (995 patients) were included. CO was {{measured}} by echocardiography in six studies, calibrated pulse contour analysis in six studies, bioreactance in four studies, oesophageal Doppler in three studies, either transpulmonary thermodilution or pulmonary artery catheter in one study and suprasternal Doppler in one study. <b>The</b> <b>pooled</b> correlation between <b>the</b> PLR-induced and the volume expansion-induced changes in CO was 0.76 (0.73 – 0.80).

5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch the ball on the opponent's end of <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> The goalkeeper would wait at the end of <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|Adjacent to {{the stadium}} was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. <b>The</b> <b>pool</b> was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length.

5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide.

In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E

50|$|In {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} ending, {{there are two}} pools of synaptic vesicles, <b>the</b> reserve <b>pool</b> and <b>the</b> ready-release <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> reserve <b>pool</b> refers to <b>the</b> synaptic vesicles that {{are not ready to}} release neurotransmitters and <b>the</b> ready-release <b>pool</b> refers to <b>the</b> vesicles which are primed to release their neurotransmitters across the presynaptic cytoplasmic membrane and into the synaptic cleft.

40|$|Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt is an {{invasive}} brown macroalgae that originates {{from the}} Far East, {{it was first}} found in the U. K. off the south coast of England in 1973. The focus {{of the study is}} on the impact of S. muticum on rockpool chemistry and ecology at Wembury Bay and Heybrook Bay, Devon. At the two sample locations ten rockpools were selected and at each site the S. muticum was removed from five <b>pools.</b> <b>The</b> changes in rockpool chemistry and ecology were monitored and variations between <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> with and without S. muticum were observed. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> were sampled over low tide in the day and at night, measurements of pH, oxygen, temperature and salinity ^ere taken. In the day the dense canopy of the seaweed prevented light penetrating to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> and <b>the</b> water did not warm up to the same extent as that in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> with no S. muticum. At night <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> containing S. muticum are warmer than those without indicating the canopy of the seaweed insulates the water. In the day the oxygen concentration is high in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> containing S. muticum due to the high rate of photosynthesis. At night the oxygen levels in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> containing S. muticum fall as the gas is used up by respiration. <b>The</b> <b>pools</b> with no S. muticum remain at a similar oxygen concentration whether night or day. The pH and the salinity data did not indicate any clear patterns in the data. The ecology of <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> was compared in May and August to assess any changes in species diversity. S. muticum appears to displace native macroalgae by shading species that can not survive in low light intensities e. g. Bifurcaria bifurcata. When the S. muticum was removed several species proliferated, namely B. bifurcata and Ulva lactuca. The shading effect of S. muticum had a positive impact on the crustose algae in <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> e. g. Corallina officinalis. These species can not survive in direct sunlight as they are bleached by the sun and are therefore protected by the fronds of 5. muticum...|$|R
