25|$|Upon his {{returning}} to Sarawak, the rebellion against Brunei's rule {{was still in}} progress. He managed to completely suppress the rebellion and pardoned the rebels for joining his side, providing positions in some administrative authority while limiting their power. Despite the initial refusal of Hashim to pardon them and wanting to execute all the rebels, Hashim was convinced by Brooke to forgive them as {{he had taken the}} major part in their suppression. In exchange for Brooke's continuous support towards the Sultanate and rental payment of £500, he was awarded the Kuching area from the Sultanate of Brunei; which later became Sarawak First Division. Hashim, however, began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about giving the territory to Brooke, a doubt fanned by Mahkota who had been deprived of his power in the area in favour of Brooke. This led Hashim to constantly delay the recognition of concession and angered Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Brooke, with Royalist fully armed, went ashore to Hashim's audience chamber and called on him to negotiate. With little choice, and putting the blame mainly on Mahkota, Hashim proclaimed Brooke as the Rajah. Brooke issued new laws for the territory banning slavery, headhunting and piracy; and by July 1842, his appointment was confirmed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II.|$|E

It is not the most thrilling of videos, and he may want <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about moonwalking in a video-- someone did it before him and better-- but it is a nice change of pace from some of his more hectic, gruffer clips." [...] Cameron Matthews of AOL Music commented that the video gives [...] "a kaleidoscopic view" [...] between Derulo's beachfront paradise, an assortment of [...] "edgy suits" [...] and [...] "a little bit of pillow talk with his new 'It Girl'."

2500|$|While Kellett {{states that}} [...] "Many in {{attendance}} applaud his efforts," [...] she also provides the following qualification: [...] "But others criticize the author, claiming his book contains factual errors and misstatements. Members {{of the local}} Jewish community say it's simply one-sided." [...] She quotes Tali Ariav of the Hillel Jewish Student Center on the Iowa campus, who stated: [...] "'I am an Israeli so of course I served in the military, so I feel emotionally involved, but I feel every person, every American, every thinker needs <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about Carter's opinion, because it's not right' ..."

2500|$|The Forward related how one {{individual}} felt: [...] "'There's a great frustration that American Jews {{want to do}} something,' said Ira Youdovin, {{executive vice president of}} the Chicago Board of Rabbis. [...] 'In 1947, some number would have enlisted in the Haganah, ' he said, referring to the pre-state Jewish armed force. [...] 'There was a special American brigade. [...] Nowadays you can't do that. [...] The battle here is the hasbarah war,' Youdovin said, using a Hebrew term for public relations. [...] 'We're winning, but we're very much concerned about the bad stuff.'" [...] Indicative of the diversity of opinion is a 2003 Boston Globe profile of the CAMERA media watchdog group in which Mark Jurkowitz observes: [...] "To its supporters, CAMERA is figuratively - and perhaps literally - doing God's work, battling insidious anti-Israeli bias in the media. [...] But its detractors see CAMERA as a myopic and vindictive special interest group trying to muscle its views into media coverage." [...] A former spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in New York City said that the result of this lobbying of the media was: “Of course, a lot of self-censorship goes on. Journalists, editors, and politicians are going <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about criticizing Israel if they know they are going to get thousands of angry calls in a matter of hours. The Jewish lobby is good at orchestrating pressure.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Kate Clark is a New York-based sculptor, {{residing}} {{and working}} in Brooklyn. Her work synthesizes human faces with the bodies of animals, the signature component in all of her work.

Mary Logan Barmeyer says Clark's work is [...] "meant <b>to</b> make you <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> {{about what it means to}} be human, and furthermore, what it means to be animal."

40|$|Inspired by {{an article}} on 50 terms that, in the {{interest}} of clarity in scientific reasoning and communication in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields, “should be avoided or at most be used sparingly and only with explicit caveats,” 1 we propose a list of terms <b>to</b> avoid or <b>think</b> <b>twice</b> about before using when writing for the International Journal of Eating Disorders (IJED). Drawing upon our experience as reviewers or editors for the IJED, we generated an abridged list of such terms. For each term, we explain why it made our list and what alternatives we recommend. We hope that our list will contribute to improved clarity in scientific thinking about eating disorders, and that it will stimulate discussion of terms that may need to be reconsidered in our field's vocabulary to ensure the use of language that is respectful and sensitive to individuals who experience an eating disorder...|$|R
