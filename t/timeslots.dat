5|$|Kneale's {{remaining}} television {{work was}} written for ITV. His first script for ITV was the one-off play Murrain, made by the network's Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called Beasts, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different <b>timeslots</b> and some in different sequences.|$|E
5|$|Production of Thunderbirds {{ended in}} August 1966 with the {{completion}} of the sixth episode of Series Two. In February that year, it had been reported that Grade had been unable to sell the series in the United States due to disagreements over <b>timeslots.</b> In July, he cancelled Thunderbirds after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer. The three major US networks of the time– NBC, CBS and ABC– had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price. When NBC withdrew its offer, the other two immediately followed.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons <b>timeslots</b> {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the {{producers}} were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and they felt the move would destroy its ratings.|$|E
5000|$|In TDMA, each user's <b>timeslot</b> {{ends with}} a guard period, to avoid data loss and to reduce {{interference}} to the following user, caused by propagation delay. Thus a user's <b>timeslot</b> is protected from interference from the preceding user, by the guard interval (guard period) {{at the end of}} that preceding user's <b>timeslot.</b> It is a common misconception that each TDMA <b>timeslot</b> begins with a guard interval, however the ITU Technical Specifications (such as GSM 05.05) clearly define the guard period as being at the end of each <b>timeslot,</b> thus providing protection against data loss within that <b>timeslot,</b> and protection against interference to the following <b>timeslot.</b>|$|R
30|$|Spatial reuse is the reuse of a <b>timeslot</b> by {{simultaneously}} activated links, {{with sufficient}} SINR, in the spatial domain. Likewise, temporal reuse is defined {{here as the}} reuse of a <b>timeslot</b> {{by a group of}} links in the time domain. A temporal reuse group is the set of outgoing links from a particular node, which may transmit in a certain <b>timeslot.</b> Since a transmission schedule is composed of a T-length frame that is repeated in time, every <b>timeslot</b> in the frame is repeated at frequency 1 /T. This means that the links in a temporal reuse group will share the capacity of a <b>timeslot</b> over all the repetitions of the <b>timeslot</b> in which the temporal reuse group appears. The reuse of a <b>timeslot</b> in the time domain thus refers to a <b>timeslot,</b> at a particular location in the scheduling frame, that is reused by a group of links as the specific <b>timeslot</b> reoccurs with the repetition of the frame in time.|$|R

5|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs {{regularly}} on Bravo in the United States; most episodes are approximately one hour in length, and are broadcast in standard definition and high definition. Since its premiere, the series has alternated airing on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday evenings {{and has been}} frequently shifted between the 8:00, 9:00, and 10:00 PM <b>timeslots.</b> The first season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta included seven episodes and one reunion special, and aired from October 7, 2008, until November 25, 2008. The second season consisted of fourteen episodes, a two-part reunion special, and a deleted scenes special; it premiered on July 30, 2009, and concluded on November 5, 2009. The third season commenced airing on October 4, 2010, after airing sixteen episodes and a two-part reunion special, it ended on January 30, 2011.

The fifth season premiered on November 4, 2012, and concluded on April 21, 2013 after broadcasting twenty episodes and a three-part reunion special. The sixth season commenced airing on November 3, 2013, and ended on May 18, 2014.

30|$|In {{consideration}} of GSM as an asynchronous system, downlink signals between each base station do not perform <b>timeslot</b> synchronization. The boundary of each <b>timeslot</b> would not coincide in one physical frame {{period in the}} received sampled signal of the same carrier coming from different cells. Hence, the detection for every <b>timeslot</b> power must perform sliding widow detection in a burst over one <b>timeslot</b> period. Moreover, parallel detecting using nine groups of training sequence code for every time-delay signal is to detect whether this <b>timeslot</b> exists in traffic occupancy and also to detect the corresponding training sequence code of maximum correlative power signal when <b>timeslot</b> is existing in traffic occupancy. Figure  1 shows the parallel sliding window time slot detection technology method.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for combining {{a plurality of}} 8 B/ 10 B encoded DVB-ASI input streams into an aggregate output data stream allows a receiving device to synchronize to the aggregate output data stream by mapping a synchronization character to a unique character if the synchronization character occurs in a first <b>timeslot</b> of the aggregate output data stream. This unique character allows a receiving device to synchronize to the aggregate output data stream. If the synchronization character occurs in a <b>timeslot</b> other than the first <b>timeslot,</b> the synchronization character is mapped to another special character that denotes that no data {{is present in the}} <b>timeslot.</b> In addition, if the synchronization character occurs in a <b>timeslot</b> after the last <b>timeslot</b> in which data may be placed in the aggregate output data stream, the synchronization character can be mapped to yet another special character denoting that no data is available in the <b>timeslot.</b> Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

Also during this period, WPXI had in increase during the morning hours and the WPXI-produced 10 p.m. news remained in first place.

This usually amounts to four NHRA events a season, including the U.S. Nationals. The station often pre-empts live coverage of the NHRA, FA Cup Final, and German Bundesliga soccer matches to after the late news in order to retain paid programming revenue for those afternoon <b>timeslots</b> that Fox uses to carry prestigious sporting events.|$|E

30|$|Scanning per <b>timeslot</b> {{for each}} carrier {{frequency}} can effectively distinguish each <b>timeslot's</b> idle state and traffic state: in the idle state of <b>timeslot,</b> the corresponding correlative power of all training sequence code C/I {{is less than}} 0 (C/I[*]<[*] 0) where the <b>timeslot</b> power reflects the noise floor of radio networks, so the measuring in the idle state of <b>timeslot</b> supplies more fine grid's accurate measuring data source and new analysis methods for more precise estimation of noise floor; in the traffic state of <b>timeslot,</b> the corresponding correlative power of all training sequence code C/I is larger than 0 (C/I[*]>[*] 0) under normal conditions, so whether the carrier power comes from serving cells or interference cells can be decided according to training sequence allocation.
