It managed to chart on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart at number 21. The track later charted in the Netherlands and New Zealand at number 71 and 47, respectively.

5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> are. Physical puberty comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.|$|E

5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks—each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of water—were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E

25|$|Lee {{used the}} month-long pause in McClellan's advance to fortify the {{defenses}} of Richmond and extended the works {{south of the}} James River to a point below Petersburg; the total length of the new defensive line was about 30 miles (50km). To buy time to complete the new defensive line and prepare for an offensive, Lee repeated the tactic of making {{a small number of}} troops seem more numerous <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> were. Lee also sent Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry brigade completely around the Union army (June 13–15) in order to ascertain if the Union right flank was in the air. In addition, Lee ordered Jackson to bring his force to the Peninsula as reinforcements. Meanwhile, McClellan shifted most of his forces south of the Chickahominy, leaving only Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps north of the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} a number of {{parallels}} with long-running BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, Only Fools and Horses creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's Minder, which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of Only Fools and Horses and Minder were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers (in the days before video recorders were commonplace in many UK homes).|$|E

500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it.

Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> are".|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E

Thus, parents of low-performing students report their children to be friends of high-performing students.

500|$|Valve still recognizes it has {{a problem}} with what it calls [...] "fake games", those that are built around reused assets and little other innovation, {{designed}} only to generate profit from unsuspecting users. To help assist finding and removing these games from the service, the company plans to add Steam Explorers atop its existing Steam Curator program, according to various YouTube personalities that have spoken out about such games in the past and with Valve directly, including Jim Sterling and TotalBiscuit. Any Steam user is able to sign up to be an Explorer, and are asked to look at under-performing games on the service as to either vouch that the game is truly original and simply lost among other releases, or if it {{is an example of a}} [...] "fake game", at which point Valve can take action to remove the game. Valve also made changes to the trading card system in May 2017 to prevent abuse by [...] "fake games". Valve found that some of the [...] "bad actors" [...] that released these games with trading card support then distributed game codes to thousands of bot-operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit; these games would also create false positives that make these titles appear more popular <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> were and would impact games suggested to legitimate players through their store algorithms. Subsequent to this patch, games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards, with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met.|$|E

The term, mithyatva, meaning 'perversity', is generally used to denote the idea of avidya along with mithyadarsana or mithyadrsti (wrong view), darsanamoha (delusion of vision), moha (delusion) etc.;.

[...] Passions such as Aversion (dvesa) and Attachment (raga), which are also called pursuers from the limitless past (anantanubandhi), operate in conjunction with mithyatva.

40|$|This highly {{original}} book {{develops a}} systematic zero-net-profit comparative statics {{theory of the}} firm that challenges many widely held views in microeconomics. It builds {{a bridge between the}} marginalist long-run theory of the firm and Sraffian theory to create a unified theoretical framework that explains how firms react to exogenous shocks resulting in new equilibrium positions of the whole economy. The central message of the book is that too often economists expect more from the microeconomic laws of input demand and output supply <b>than</b> <b>they</b> can <b>really</b> give. The authors show that the zero-net-profit condition requires a more articulated analysis that sometimes yields qualitative results contrary to those of familiar economic laws. Written for academic researchers and graduate students, the book will be of particular interest to those working on the microeconomics of industry equilibrium, comparative statics and Sraffian economics"-...|$|R
