5|$|Among {{the ways}} that the {{government}} could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also manufactured in the United States, to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing, pecuniary boundaries, and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities. Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Welfare</b> clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E
5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare</b> of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E

25|$|Associate Justice Roberts again {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} a divided court, agreeing with those challenging the tax. Regarding agriculture as an essentially local activity, the court invalidated the AAA {{as a violation of}} the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. The court also used the occasion to settle a dispute over <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Welfare</b> Clause stemming back to the administration of George Washington, holding Congress possessed a power to tax and spend for <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} four U.S. {{states to}} officially use the term commonwealth. The term was used for Kentucky as it had also been used by Virginia, from which Kentucky was created.

25|$|The first {{limitation}} {{was that the}} movements and position of the heavenly bodies point to such occurrences as are of public import and affect <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> The individual's interests are {{not in any way}} involved, and we must descend many centuries and pass beyond the confines of Babylonia and Assyria before we reach that phase which in medieval and modern astrology is almost exclusively dwelt upon—the individual horoscope.|$|E

25|$|The fur trade benefited Indigenous {{people as}} well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Knives, pots and kettles, nets, {{firearms}} and hatchets made provided improvements in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> At the same time, while {{their everyday lives}} were made easier, some traditional {{ways of doing things}} were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar.|$|E
25|$|The fact {{developed}} {{quickly that}} the states were unable to give the requisite relief. The problem had become national in area and dimensions. There was need of help from the nation if the people were not to starve. It is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that, in a crisis so extreme, {{the use of the}} moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> Cf. United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1.|$|E
25|$|Agent-neutral consequentialism {{ignores the}} {{specific}} value {{a state of}} affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare,</b> but the agent {{is more concerned with}} the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.|$|E

25|$|Steward {{was part}} of a set of {{decisions}} in which the U.S. Supreme Court consistently upheld New Deal economic and regulatory legislation. Its key role was the expansion of Congressional authority to the regulation of state activity, and marked the end of Supreme Court attempts to limit Congressional power based on advancement of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> In fact, Butler, just the year before Steward, was the last case in which the Supreme Court struck down an Act of Congress as beyond the authority granted by the Spending Clause.|$|E

25|$|In 1886, {{following}} {{an outbreak of}} eye disease at an orphanage run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, some of the sisters and the sick children moved into the Schuyler Mansion. The order and the orphanage continued {{to use it for}} another 27 years, until the state bought it in 1913 for conversion into its present use as a historic site, which it has been since 1917. This institutional use of the district's original building heralded a new era for the South End. By the 20th century it was adequately supplied with housing and churches; now it was time for larger structures meant for <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whigs favored {{economic}} expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats {{were opposed to}} all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare.</b> The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and of moral and economic coercion, held fast to the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influential}} Greek {{writer and}} intellectual was Adamantios Korais {{who witnessed the}} French Revolution. Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent {{the remainder of his}} life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>welfare</b> and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died {{before the end of the}} revolution.|$|E
