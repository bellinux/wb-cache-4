40|$|The {{speed of}} protein {{digestion}} impacts on postprandial protein anabolism. After exercise {{or in the}} elderly, fast proteins stimulate protein synthesis more efficiently than slow proteins. It {{has been shown that}} meat might be a source of fast proteins. However, <b>cooking</b> <b>temperature,</b> acting on the macrostructure and microstructure of the meat could affect both the speed, and efficiency, of protein digestion. This study aims to evaluate, in vivo, the effect of meat cooking on digestion parameters, {{in the context of a}} complete meal. Six minipigs fitted with an ileal cannula and an arterial catheter were used. In order to measure the true ileal digestibility, tested meat was obtained from a calf, the muscle proteins of which were intrinsically labelled with (15) N-amino acids. Three <b>cooking</b> <b>temperatures</b> (60, 75 and 95 °C; core temperature for 30 min), and three levels of intake (1, 1. 45, and 1. 90 g protein/kg body weight) were tested. Following meat ingestion, ileal digesta and arterial blood were collected over a 9 -h period. The speed of digestion, evaluated from the kinetics of amino acid appearance in blood within the first 3 h, was greater for the <b>cooking</b> <b>temperature</b> of 75 °C, than for 60 or 95 °C. The true ileal digestibility, which averaged 95 %, was not affected by <b>cooking</b> <b>temperature</b> or by the level of meat intake.

40|$|Kappaphycus alvarezii or {{commonly}} known Euchema cottonii {{is a good}} source of kappa-carrageenan and can be found cultivated in the coastal areas of Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia. Carrageenans have many applications and are utilized in human food and pet-food industry. Carrageenans are also utilized in non-food industry such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, printing and textile formulations. Currently, the Southeast Asian region is producing semi refined carrageenan (SRC). There are various works in producing SRC; however, there are limited efforts to develop the optimization of cooking process parameters. Hence, the present study features on the cooking process (alkaline treatment) where the parameters (concentration of potassium hydroxide solution, cooking time and <b>cooking</b> <b>temperature)</b> and the ranges are identified experimentally. The effects of these parameters on carrageenan quality such as gel viscosity and gel strength were studied.

These observations correspond to the denaturation of different protein fractions at specific temperatures. 1 H-low field NMR and neutron tomography were used to further {{understand the relationship between}} the observed protein denaturation and changes in meat microstructure after heating. Hahn’s echo and solid echo NMR sequences were applied to observe fast relaxation time corresponding to rigid protons. These protons were found to be associated with pools of protons with a strong interaction with the meat matrix. Their relaxation times (T 2) are of order of 500 – 900 μs (for Hahn’s echo sequence) and 10 μs (for solid echo’s sequence). These protons become more rigid upon increasing the temperature. 3 D neutron tomography analysis demonstrated the defects created by the contraction of meat fibers and allowed measurement of their volume, which increase for the highest cooking degrees.
