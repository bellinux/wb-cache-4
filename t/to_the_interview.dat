To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her.

In May 2008, ABC News reported that someone who spoke to them under condition of anonymity had hired a private investigator who located Genie in 2000. According to the investigator she was living a simple lifestyle in a small private facility for mentally underdeveloped adults and appeared to be happy, and she only spoke a few words but could still communicate fairly well in sign language. The news stories also reported that Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87 and featured an interview with Genie's brother, who was living in Ohio, which was the only time he publicly spoke about his or Genie's lives; he told reporters that since leaving the Los Angeles area he had visited Genie and their mother only once, in 1982, and had refused to watch or read anything about Genie's life until just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> but said he had recently heard Genie was doing well.

The group claimed that they had obtained information related to government corruption and the influence of foreign interests that pressured them to act, since [...] "standing still with their arms crossed [...] violate their elemental [...] as an armed revolutionary organization", warning that they no longer intended to [...] "scream slogans" [...] at rallies, but were instead waiting [...] "to strike the adequate objective at the adequate time and place". When questioned about a draft announced by the organization some time prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> Guasábara responded by noting that [...] "being at war, the existence of Machetero comandos and permanent recruitment will be necessary [...] until we declare the Republic." [...] The EPB described its strategy as one that evolved in three steps emerging from the rearguard; the first being the defensive {{as a response to the}} enemy's offensive, the second being a period of strategic consolidation and preparation of a counterattack plan and the third being the implementation of this plan in contrast to the government's politics.|$|E

500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the pay-per-view, WWE {{announced}} on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing [...] "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston Coliseum and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011, in which {{he referred to the}} idea as one in which [...] "Heyman saw something in [...] that nobody else wanted to admit." [...] In an early 2008 interview with The Sun, Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interview,</b> McMahon nixed the idea, but Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to [...] "make" [...] a rising star like Punk.
