Three months' worth of scripts were rewritten, and Carmella was introduced <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by Goodrem's character, Nina Tucker. As a school graduate, Blair had unsuccessfully auditioned for another {{role in the}} serial, but impressed casting director Jan Russ. Six months later, Russ contacted Blair {{and asked her to}} audition for the role of Carmella. She was cast immediately, due to the urgent need <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by Goodrem. She played Carmella on an episodic basis in 2003, then returned for a longer period in 2004, and briefly in 2005. Blair returned to Neighbours in 2006, and in September 2007, signed a contract keeping her in the show for another year.|$|E

40|$|Digital Surface Models (DSM) {{derived from}} stereo-pair {{satellite}} images {{are the main}} sources for many Geo-Informatics applications like 3 D change detection, object classification and recognition. However since occlusion especially in urban scenes result in some deficiencies in the stereo matching phase, these DSMs contain some <b>voids.</b> In order <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> a range of algorithms have been proposed, mainly including interpolation alone or along with auxiliary DSM. In this paper an algorithm for void filling in DSM from stereo satellite images has been developed. Unlike common previous approaches we didn’t use any external DSM <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> Our proposed algorithm uses only the original images and the unfilled DSM itself. First a neighborhood around every <b>void</b> in <b>the</b> unfilled DSM and its corresponding area in multispectral image is defined. Then it is analysed to extract both spectral and geometric texture and accordingly to assign labels to each cell in <b>the</b> <b>voids.</b> This step contains three phases comprising shadow detection, height thresholding and image segmentation. Thus every cell in void has a label and is <b>filled</b> by <b>the</b> median value of its co-labelled neighbors. The results for datasets from WorldView- 2 and IKONOS are shown and discussed...|$|R

5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks {{were the}} {{earliest}} recorded {{inhabitants of the}} West Branch Susquehanna River basin, which includes Quehanna Wild Area. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses. The Susquehannocks' numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the Iroquois exercised nominal control of the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley.

40|$|In {{the mortar}} {{portion of a}} {{concrete}} mix, the water must be more than sufficient <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> between <b>the</b> solid particles of cement and fine aggregate whereas the paste volume must be more than sufficient <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> between <b>the</b> solid particles of fine aggregate so {{that there will be}} excess water to form water films coating all the solid particles and excess paste to form paste films coating the fine aggregate particles. Hence, it may be postulated that the water film thickness (WFT) and the paste film thickness (PFT) have major effects on the rheology of mortar. In this study, the combined effects of WFT and PFT on the rheology, cohesiveness and adhesiveness of mortar were investigated by testing mortar samples with varying water, cement and aggregate contents. It was found that whilst the WFT {{is the single most important}} factor governing the rheology of mortar, the PFT also has significant effects. Particularly, the PFT has certain interesting effects on the cohesiveness and adhesiveness of mortar, which should be duly considered in mortar design. © 2012 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 25 May 201...|$|R

5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito to be able <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void.</b> The {{majority of the population}} neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the heat {{generation}} of curing concrete may be reduced by decreasing the cement paste volume of the concrete. However, as the cement paste must be more than sufficient <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> between aggregate particles, the cement paste volume should not be limitlessly decreased. Herein, it is proposed to add an inert filler, such as limestone fines, <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> into <b>the</b> <b>voids</b> between aggregate particles so that a smaller cement paste volume may be used and the heat generation of the concrete may be further reduced. To study the effectiveness of adding limestone fines in reducing the heat generation of curing concrete, a series of concrete mixes with water/cement ratios ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 60 and different amounts of limestone fines added were tested for their workability, strength and heat generation. The results revealed that the addition of limestone fines to decrease the cement paste volume would significantly increase the strength and, more importantly, substantially reduce the heat generation of the concrete. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

He continued his fine form for the club in the 2001–02 season, averaging 16.4 points per game and 5.2 rebounds per game as Maccabi again won both domestic titles, and even reached the Euroleague 2001–02 Final Four.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh's {{importance}} as a Civil War battle, {{coupled with the}} lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development {{as one of the first}} five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved.

5|$|The Syrian Desert, which {{extended}} from Balis to Ayla, had been inhabited by Bedouin (nomadic Arab) tribes since pre-Islamic times (before mid-7th century). Throughout the 250 {{years following the}} Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s, the Bedouin were brought {{under the authority of}} the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750) and early Abbasid (750–861) caliphates. However, during this period, certain Bedouin tribes also participated in Umayyad dynastic struggles, the Abbasid Revolution, the rebellious Kharijite and Alid movements and isolated revolts. Following the Abbasid decline beginning in 861, state authority in the Syrian Desert receded significantly, leaving the Bedouin tribes <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void.</b> The Hamdanid dynasty (890–1004), members of the Banu Taghlib tribe, represented the new-found strength of the Bedouin, and according to 14th-century historian Ibn Khaldun, they commanded the subservience of all Bedouin tribes in the Syrian steppe and Upper Mesopotamia. Other tribal dynasties that emerged in this region before or after the heyday of the Hamdanids included the Uqaylids (990–1096), Numayrids (990–1081), the Banu Asad and Banu Khafaja. By the late 10th century, the Jarrahids (970s–mid 11th century) of Banu Tayy and the Mirdasids (1024–1080) of Banu Kilab dominated southern and northern Syria, respectively, first in association with the Qarmatians, and then as nominal partners of the Fatimids, who ruled Syria between 977 and 1071. As a result of the Turkic Seljuk invasion {{in the latter half of}} the 11th century, only the Banu Rabi'ah, a cadet branch of the Jarrahids, remained as an influential Arab force in the Syrian steppe by the end of the century.|$|E

The results showed that the addition of 10 % to 20 % superfine cement can significantly increase the packing density of the cement and the water film thickness of the cement paste. Such increases in packing density and water film thickness would then improve the flowability, rheology and strength of the cement paste. Hence, superfine cement is an effective cementitious filler for improving cement performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
