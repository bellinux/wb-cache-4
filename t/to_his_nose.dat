5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E
25|$|After fatally {{shooting}} Bernall, Harris {{turned toward}} the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale {{if she wanted to}} die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disoriented—possibly from the heavily bleeding wound <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E
25|$|The Suns {{had their}} home court {{advantage}} quickly taken {{away as the}} Spurs took a tight Game 1, a game that saw Nash missing the final minutes for Phoenix due to a gash <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> which bled profusely. Nash and the Suns recovered to take Game 2 but after the game, Suns forward Amar'e Stoudemire accused the Spurs, especially Bruce Bowen and Manu Ginóbili, of being a dirty team. Despite the added scrutiny by the media circles, the Spurs won Game 3. The Suns, trying to overcome their recent failures against Texas teams in the playoffs (the Spurs and the Mavericks both defeated them in the Conference Finals), willed themselves to a come-from-behind victory in Game 4 to tie the series at 2.|$|E

2500|$|James Francis Durante (February 10, 1893– January 29, 1980) was an American singer, pianist, comedian, and actor. His {{distinctive}} clipped gravelly speech, New York accent, comic language-butchery, jazz-influenced songs, {{and prominent}} nose helped make {{him one of}} America's most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s. He often referred <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> as the Schnozzola (from the German Schnauze [...] ), and the word became his nickname.|$|E
2500|$|The third Baldrick is {{much more}} noticeably crude and unintelligent than those {{previous}} to him and maybe even the most stupid of all four Baldricks. Like his Elizabethan ancestor, he is known to eat dung occasionally.

2500|$|Many Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies {{cartoons}} had characters {{based on}} Durante. One Harman-Ising short from 1933, Bosko's Picture Show, featured {{a caricature of}} Adolf Hitler chasing Durante with a meat cleaver. Two examples from the 1940s include A Gruesome Twosome, which features a cat based on Durante, and Baby Bottleneck, which in unedited versions opens with a Durante-like stork. Book Revue shows the well-known (at that time) 1924 Edna Ferber novel So Big featuring a Durante caricature on the cover. The [...] "so big" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and as a runaway criminal turns the corner by the book, Durante turns sideways using his nose to trip the criminal, allowing his capture. In Hollywood Daffy, Durante is directly depicted as himself, pronouncing his catchphrase [...] "Those are the conditions that prevail!" [...] In The Mouse-Merized Cat, Catstello (a Lou Costello mouse) is briefly hypnotized to imitate Jimmy Durante singing Lullaby of Broadway. One of Durante's common catch phrases, [...] "I got a million of 'em!", was used as Bugs' final line in Stage Door Cartoon.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had a poor {{reputation}} as a horseman. One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was [...] "a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled {{as though it had}} seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his stirrup leather six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse's back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse's foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one." [...] His horse was named [...] "Little Sorrel" [...] (also known as [...] "Old Sorrel"), a small chestnut gelding which ironically was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm. He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept was}} widely popularized in {{anthropology}} through the book, [...] "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" [...] by James C. Scott (1976). The book {{begins with a}} telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live {{so close to the}} subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were [...] "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a [...] "safety first" [...] principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as [...] "traditionalist" [...] when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides [...] "subsistence insurance" [...] for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.|$|E
