500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E

[...] His manner with them {{was a combination of}} raw, sometimes violent criticism and good humor. Hofmann wrote of one such lesson: ...|$|E

"Humans, unlike {{just about}} all the other animals on earth, create fairly {{sophisticated}} languages which not only enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able {{to think about their}} thinking and even think about thinking about their thinking." ...|$|E
3000|$|One of the {{participants}} was even more precise in his statement. According to him, developers that do not practice TDD, as they do not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the class design they are building, they end up not doing good use of OOP. TDD forces developers to speed down, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> better <b>about</b> what they are doing: [...]...|$|R
50|$|My goal, however, {{was not to}} make lots of money, but to {{influence}} people's thinking. <b>To</b> get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> differently <b>about</b> waste, and give <b>them</b> tools <b>to</b> deal with it. Self-publishing my book was the way I could do that. So I learned what I {{had to learn to}} be able to do so.|$|R
50|$|It’s a {{story about}} five people who have met in mysterious circumstances. All of them are on the otherside of the law. Each one of <b>them</b> tries <b>to</b> {{maximize}} as the story progresses. The situation is very volatileand keeps changing every moment. So each one of <b>them</b> has <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{what they need to}} do inorder to survive the ordeal.|$|R

There are a great many things for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> when they marry a second time: their children, their positions, and all that. I believe that if {{a man and his}} wife discussed it, which they would not be likely to do, they would be very apt to be of the same mind in regard to {{the sort of person who}} ought to come in as number two. For my part, I do not wonder at all that so many women have cast their eyes on Margaret Temple as a person they would like to have take their places when they are gone. For one thing, you know they would not be jealous of her; this is very important. Then, they would be as certain as anything can be certain in this world that their children, if they had any, as well as their husbands, would be in most excellent hands. Often, when I have been thinking about her, I have called Margaret Temple the Vice-consort; but I have never told any one this. Please remember.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{considerable}} time passed before Martin {{returned to the}} meal the three young women had provided for him, during which he was in close consultation with the widow. In the first place, she began upbraiding him for his folly in wishing to marry an old maid for her money; she then taxed him with villany, for trying to cheat Anty out of her property; and when he defended himself from that charge by telling her {{what he had done}} about the settlement, she asked him how much he had to pay the rogue of a lawyer for that [...] "gander's job". She then proceeded to point out all the difficulties which lay {{in the way of a}} marriage between him, Martin, and her, Anty; and showed how mad it was for either of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. From that, she got into a narrative of Barry's conduct, and Anty's sufferings, neither of which lost anything in the telling; and having by this time gossiped herself into a good humour, she proceeded to show how, through her means and assistance, the marriage might take place if he was still bent upon it. She eschewed all running away, and would hear of no clandestine proceedings. They should be married in the face of day, as the Kellys ought, with all their friends round them. [...] "They'd have no huggery-muggery work, up in a corner; not they indeed! why should they?--for fear of Barry Lynch?--who cared for a dhrunken blackguard like that?--not she indeed! who ever heard of a Kelly being afraid of a Lynch?--They'd ax him to come and see his sister married, and av' he didn't like it, he might do the other thing." ...|$|E

[...] "That ought <b>to</b> give <b>them</b> something <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> They only know just what they are told.

30|$|We {{explained}} to the participants that the exercises simulated real world problems {{and that they were}} supposed to write code considering that it would be maintained by another team. They were asked to implement the most elegant and flexible solution they could in both exercises. We encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> carefully <b>about</b> each solution, trying their best, regardless of the use or not of TDD.|$|R
50|$|Back to the Floor is {{a reality}} {{television}} series broadcast on BBC2 in the late 1990s and early 2000s in which CEOs or top level managers went undercover in their organisations and took a junior/entry level job in their company. This gave <b>them</b> much <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> during the exercise and learn how their company really works, what the industry is like, and what their employees really think of them.|$|R
50|$|Teachers ask questions, {{awakening}} a {{sense of}} wonder in the students and prompting <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> deeply <b>about</b> the subject matter. A key idea or assignment might require that the teacher present material to the class, but the forward progress of the class {{is driven by the}} questions that the teacher asks of the students, the answers that they give, and the further questions that those answers inspire.|$|R

5000|$|Language allows {{children}} to organize personal {{past and present}} experiences and share these memories with others. [...] This exchange of dialogue makes children aware of their personal past and encourages <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> their cognitive self and how past activities have affected them in the present. Several {{studies have shown that}} simply discussing events with children in general could lead to more easily retrievable memories. There has also been research that suggests {{the degree to which a}} child discusses events with adults shapes autobiographical recollection. This has implications for gender and cultural differences. Autobiographical memory begins to emerge as parents engage in memory talk with their children and encourage <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> why a certain event happened. Memory talk allows {{children to}} develop memory systems in order to categorize generic versus unique events.|$|E
40|$|Jon Nixon’s article, ‘Learning the Language of Deliberative Democracy’ {{explored}} {{languages of}} hope {{in relation to the}} discourses of deliberative democracy. Ours continues this theme of finding languages of hope. Like his article, ours makes people central. It explores a neglected area of epistemology: knowing people. It suggests that we take a critical perspective on the metaphors we live and then re-configure <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> again <b>about</b> the public and private spaces in the universities where we work...|$|R

50|$|Project SEED {{started as}} a result of Johntz {{teaching}} a remedial math class at Berkeley High School (Berkeley, California) in 1963. Frustrated by the failure of standard remediation to improve the basic math skills of his students, he began teaching them algebra using a Socratic, question-and-answer technique. They responded well to this new material that allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> conceptually <b>about</b> mathematics, but since they were already in high school, there was little time left for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> turn around their academic careers.|$|R
5000|$|Britton was notably {{ambivalent}} about abortion: he was vocal {{about his personal}} opposition to the procedure, and would sometimes turn away women seeking it, telling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the decision and {{come back in a}} week if they still wanted an abortion. However, he described anti-abortion protesters as [...] "fanatics." ...|$|E

He does tell them how he repaid her for the long ago theft.|$|E
60|$|From {{the first}} day of starting, the midshipmen set {{themselves}} to learn something of the language. The idea was Jack's and he pointed out to Hawtry, who was rather disinclined to take the trouble, that it would in the first place give <b>them</b> something <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> and be an amusement on the line of march; in the second, it would render their captivity less dull, and, lastly, it would facilitate their escape if they should determine to make the attempt.|$|R

Three case studies in the Re-envisioning Branch Libraries research project will also be presented...|$|R
5000|$|... § 33. Our pure {{concepts}} of the understanding are not derived from experience and they also contain strict necessity, which experience never attains.

50|$|Teams are {{primed for}} {{brainstorming}} through {{the review of}} their HPM process diagrams. This step reminds stakeholders about the content being discussed and allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> each process in detail, reviewing what works well and what may be improved. Additionally, the time between the initial interview and follow-up meeting should have provided each stakeholder {{with the opportunity to}} independently think about the processes.|$|E

There is, however, another theory for why Tsanin sold Lezte Neies to Mapai: he knew that his ideas would stir up party operatives, which would force <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his ideas.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Pond from TheWrap {{described}} it as [...] "very entertaining, even if it’s about as factual as This Is Spinal Tap". He noted that the film [...] "acts like a doc but works as myth, not fact; director Ziga Virc doesn’t want audiences to believe what he’s telling them so much as he wants <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> why they’re so ready to accept any kind of tomfoolery and conspiracy the media puts in front of them".|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the book}} has been positive, with Canadian Literature praising Diamond Grill's complexity.
