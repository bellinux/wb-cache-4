5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support <b>this</b> <b>assertion</b> then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E

5|$|South American giant {{cockroaches}} of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica {{were believed to be}} the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles.

5|$|Coghill {{received}} his first drum {{at the age}} of 14, which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents. In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite <b>this</b> <b>assertion,</b> as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on <b>this</b> <b>assertion.</b>|$|E

5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back <b>this</b> <b>assertion</b> other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. <b>This</b> <b>assertion</b> has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, have pointed out that concern over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E
5|$|Modesty, Tubman's {{maternal}} grandmother, {{arrived in}} the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she was of Ashanti lineage (from what is now Ghana), though no evidence exists to confirm or deny <b>this</b> <b>assertion.</b> Her mother Rit (who {{may have had a}} white father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.|$|E

5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested <b>this</b> <b>assertion,</b> stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E
5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place {{in exactly the same}} world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting <b>this</b> <b>assertion,</b> Ishii has also {{said in an interview that}} Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
5|$|York was a Viking {{capital in}} the 10th century, and {{continued}} as an important northern city in the 11th century. In 1068, on William the Conqueror's first northern expedition after the Norman Conquest, he built a number of castles across the north-east of England, including one at York. This first castle at York was a basic wooden motte and bailey castle built between the rivers Ouse and Foss {{on the site of}} the present-day York Castle. It was built in haste; contemporary accounts imply it was constructed in only eight days, although <b>this</b> <b>assertion</b> has been challenged. The motte was originally around 200 feet (61 metres) wide at the base. As it was built in an urban environment, hundreds of houses had to be destroyed to make way for the development. William Malet, the sheriff of Yorkshire, was placed in charge of the castle and successfully defended it against an immediate uprising by the local population.|$|E
