5|$|A man {{ceases to}} love humanity, and then individuals, as he {{advances}} in the chase after wealth; as one clashes with his interest, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> his pleasures: to business, as it is termed, every thing must give way; nay, is sacrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, husband, father, brother, become empty names.|$|E
5|$|Artefacts in the {{collection}} include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint.

5|$|The {{classification}} {{of this species}} is still debated, and molecular research by Joseph and Wilke in 2006 found that the complex split genetically into two clades—one roughly correlating with B. z. barnardi and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> the other three forms; B. z. macgillivrayi was {{more closely related to}} B. z. zonarius than to the neighbouring B. z. barnardi. The researchers felt it was premature to reorganise the {{classification of}} the complex until more study was undertaken.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{encounter}} battle, {{the action}} had been fought between two forces of roughly equal {{size in the}} heavy monsoon rain at close quarters. Both companies had deployed to the high ground at {{around the same time}} in a bid to outflank <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>with</b> the Australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while the Viet Cong had attempted to nullify the Australian tactics by remaining in close contact. Ultimately, the artillery had decided the outcome in favour of the Australians however, and the Viet Cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties. In this way the fighting bore many similarities to the victory twelve months earlier at Long Tan, yet it remained largely unheralded in Australia. Eight Australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions, including Military Crosses to O'Donnell, Ross and Clark, while Sutherland was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. A number of awards were also made to the RAAF pilots and aircrew, including Cox who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Meanwhile, the bravery evident by the Viet Cong during the battle had also made an impression on the Australians, who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and the skilfulness of their battle drills and tactics which they found to be similar to those used by the Australians themselves.|$|E

5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> the more natural design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was chosen and the final design {{of the house was}} based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> 12-inch guns. Toropov {{estimated that the}} ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion {{in favor of the}} smaller caliber.|$|E

5|$|Danielle {{arrives in}} Walford, having left her {{hometown}} of Telford and is befriended by local resident Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who gives her a job on her market clothing stall and offers her the spare room in her family's home. Danielle quickly develops a crush on fellow stall-trader Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan), who leads her on {{in an attempt to}} make Stacey jealous but he helps her get a second job, cleaning at The Queen Victoria public house, where she gets caught in the feud between Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Janus) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). Both try to use Danielle to get information from <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>with</b> Archie persuading Danielle to steal Ronnie's post. Ronnie is furious when she realises and sacks Danielle after publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing a photograph of Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's long-lost daughter, Amy.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 Horrocks {{was posted}} to Russia {{as part of}} the Allied {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War. After landing at Vladivostok on 19 April, he was briefed at British headquarters. The White Army under Admiral Kolchak, with the help of released Czechoslovak Legion prisoners, had driven the Red Army out of Siberia. However, Kolchak's Czech troops were returning home, and the British military contingent was urgently trying to replace them with Russians. To accomplish this, the British had just two infantry battalions and two small administrative missions, one charged with training and arming the Russians with British war-surplus equipment, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> improving the White Army's communications.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined {{the causes of the}} battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944 General George Kenney, the {{commander}} of the Allied air forces in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), adopted a goal of landing forces at Selaru Island in the eastern NEI and establishing a bomber base there. Accordingly, in early March, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, who led RAAF Command, presented Kenney with a proposal for the RAAF to contribute two fighter wings and several ancillary units to this operation, which at the time was scheduled for 15June. One of these wings would be equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> Spitfires. In March Group Captain Clive Caldwell, the RAAF's highest-scoring flying ace of the war, reluctantly accepted command of the projected Spitfire wing after his request for a transfer to Europe was rejected by Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal George Jones. In a meeting between Jones and Caldwell, Jones stated that the wing would have the highest priority for supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>with</b> nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
30|$|Before an AC being {{upgraded}} by the tuner, each of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ACs <b>with</b> higher gain values {{must have}} been upgraded to its highest level (e.g., S 3), and all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ACs <b>with</b> lower or equal gain values must not be tuned until the upgrading of the current AC to its highest level is finished; before an AC being degraded by the tuner, each of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ACs <b>with</b> lower gain values {{must have been}} degraded to its lowest level (e.g., S 0), and all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ACs <b>with</b> higher or equal gain values must not be tuned until the degrading of the current AC to its lowest level is finished.
