5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, the Buzz of Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, the Buzz of Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press,</b> and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E

500|$|In general, [...] "I Hate December" [...] has {{a darker}} theme that is rarely heard in Christmas music. Durand {{talks about her}} fears of death, singing: [...] "All I know is what I dream / But lately dreams have been such scary things / Of suicide and frozen ice over my pale body". <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> editor Ira A. Robbins joked that with Lately, Ivy was {{attempting}} to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. In his book The <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Guide to '90s Rock, Robbins and Vickie Gilmer summarized it as an [...] "original [...] wah-wahing" [...] song recorded in the [...] "City of Lights". On an episode of the MTV2 music program 120 Minutes, Schlesinger described the message behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] as [...] "anti-Christian". In response, host Matt Pinfield compared the lyrics and inspiration behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] to [...] "that Fear single [...] years ago" [...] (referring to that band's 1982 single [...] "Fuck Christmas").|$|E
500|$|In October 1976, Phil Sutcliffe of Sounds {{magazine}} described Hillage's {{adoption of}} both [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] and Donovan's [...] "Hurdy Gurdy Man" [...] as the [...] "policy statements" [...] for his solo career. Speaking to <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> that same month, Hillage {{said he was}} drawn to the Beatles song because of its positive message, but especially its success in conveying joy without resorting to escapism.|$|E
500|$|The {{contemporary}} {{review in}} <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> praised the Furs for their [...] "increased sophistication" [...] as songwriters and musicians. The album {{was described as}} both [...] "alluring and amusing" [...] in Rolling Stone, and music critic Robert Christgau graded it with an [...] "A-" [...] rating in The Village Voice. Later assessments have been similarly kind: writing for AllMusic, Ned Raggett effusively called it [...] "simply fantastic" [...] while Stylus looked back on it as [...] "the Furs' masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|The <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Guide to '90s Rock {{called the}} album a [...] "surly milkshake of broken rock shards... from the artistic {{misspellings}} of song titles to the lyric collage {{on the inner}} sleeve and the abrasive, abstract guitar noises on the songs, Pretty on the Inside reveals the band's fascination with the New York no wave art and music scene of the '80s." [...] According to Billboard, the album had sold 27,000 copies by 1994, when the band released their wildly popular follow-up album, Live Through This.|$|E
500|$|<b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> {{was one of}} the {{few major}} media outlets that did not give the album a good review, instead giving it an average review and stating that [...] "more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded {{material}} more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the music as [...] "purty" [...] but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general to be boring.|$|E
500|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review by}} Allmusic commented that 1987 is [...] "a hilarious record" [...] filled with [...] "comments on music terrorism and [...] own unique {{take on the}} Run-D.M.C. type of old-school rapping"; and The Penguin Price Guide for Record & CD Collectors called 1987 an [...] "entirely brilliant example {{of the art of}} disc-jockey-as-producer". Giving another retrospective review from across the Atlantic, <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> described 1987 as [...] "energetic" [...] and [...] "a loopy dance album that isn't unlike a lot of sampled records, but proceeds from an entirely different cultural understanding." ...|$|E
500|$|Followers of Fred Frith's music {{generally}} {{had trouble}} {{coming to terms}} with Cheap at Half the Price. To them Frith was [...] "progressive, genre-bending music's last great hope", and on this album he appeared to have abandoned this role. When the album was released on LP in 1983, Recommended Records, founded and run by Chris Cutler (Frith's band-mate from Henry Cow), elected not to stock it because Cutler felt it was not [...] "terribly good". <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> said that the quality of the record suffered from the lo-fi experiment of recording [...] "at home on a 4-track".|$|E
500|$|<b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> {{said about}} the track [...] "A Short Term Effect": It [...] "stresses ephemeralness with Smith's echo-laden voice {{decelerating}} {{at the end of}} each phrase". Ira Robbins observed that [...] "the song closest to basic pop" [...] is [...] "A Strange Day": It [...] "has overdubbed backing vocals plus a delineated verse and chorus wrapped in some strangely consonant guitar figures". The journalist also commented: the song [...] "Cold" [...] "gets the full gothic treatment", with [...] "grandiose minor-mode organ swells". Describing the title track, writer Dave McCullough said that it [...] "tries to copy Cabaret Voltaire, all shuddering tape noise".|$|E
500|$|Pleasant Dreams, the band's sixth album, was {{released}} in 1981. It continued the trend established by End of the Century, taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records. As described by <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press,</b> the album, produced by Graham Gouldman of UK pop act 10cc, moved the Ramones [...] "away from their pioneering minimalism into heavy metal territory". Johnny would contend in retrospect that this direction was a record company decision, a continued futile attempt to get airplay on American radio. While Pleasant Dreams reached number 58 on the U.S. chart, its two singles failed to register at all.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Record Guide {{entry on}} the Sex Pistols {{declares}} that [...] "their importance—both to {{the direction of}} contemporary music and more generally to pop culture—can hardly be overstated". Rolling Stone {{has argued that the}} band, [...] "in direct opposition to the star trappings and complacency" [...] of mid-1970s rock, [...] "came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture—the rise of punk." [...] In 2004, the magazine ranked the Sex Pistols No.58 on its list of the [...] "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Leading music critic Dave Marsh called them [...] "unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Enough" [...] was {{highlighted}} by critics due to Durand's vocals and its simple production. Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins of <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> {{were impressed by}} the singer's vocal delivery on the track. The pair claimed that her [...] "airy, petal-soft lilt and the music's toned-down pop bounce make it forever Ivy". Billboards Larry Flick reviewed the CD single {{as part of his}} [...] "Single Reviews: Rock Tracks" [...] column. He wrote that Durand's [...] "seductive French accent seeps through a suspiciously sugar-sweet delivery", and noted that her delivery comes off [...] "pure as dirt, but cool nonetheless". British newspaper Melody Maker named [...] "Get Enough" [...] a [...] "Single of the Week" [...] in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Daniel Amos vocalist Terry Scott Taylor {{recorded}} what <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> admired as a [...] "first-rate cover" [...] of [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] for his album A Briefing for the Ascent. Conversely, Sean Carruthers of AllMusic considers singer Tom Hooper's 2002 {{cover to}} be a version that [...] "manages {{to drain the}} life" [...] out of the composition. Elliott Smith included [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] in his live performances. His biographer Benjamin Nugent writes that the song appealed to Smith amid his struggles with depression and drug addiction, as [...] "a ballad about {{trying to get rid}} of self-imposed suffering and returning to a place where you can relate to other people".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Experimental Jet Set, {{which is}} often {{described}} as difficult and claustrophobic, Washing Machine was considerably more open-ended and contains some of the band's longest songs. It was also the first Sonic Youth album on which Gordon almost exclusively played guitar instead of bass, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> remarked that the album contains musical references to the Shangri-Las and the Byrds and described its style as [...] " [...] between trance-guitar experiments and more concise statements." [...] Entertainment Weekly described it thus: [...] "These songs unfold over even-tempered rhythms and guitars that linger rather than attack. A splatter of distortion may enter, but the effect is mostly languid and wonderfully hypnotic".|$|E
500|$|Borbetomagus {{released}} a live {{recording of the}} song on their 1992 album Buncha Hair That Long, a version that <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> later said [...] "could easily reunite the Beatles for good if it were played {{in the presence of}} the surviving trio". On their 2003 live album Seven Year Itch, Siouxsie and the Banshees included a reading that, according to The Guardians reviewer, [...] "transformed [...] into an apocalyptic howl". Other artists who have covered [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] include Tracy Bonham, on her 2007 album In the City + In the Woods, and the Secret Machines, whose version appears in the Julie Taymor-directed film Across the Universe (2007). Former Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes recorded a ukulele rendition for his 2008 solo album The Beatles Uke.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeri Montesano from AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and {{described it as}} [...] "a fun record that doesn't {{need to be taken}} too seriously". He further said that [...] "it would be difficult to find a record from this era that sounds half as good. Pop rarely reaches these heights." [...] While reviewing the Buggles' second album, the same author stated that both albums [...] "still sound fresh" [...] compared to 1990s pop music. An Amazon.com editor named Grant Alden also compared the album to 1990s pop, and labeled the group as [...] "Part of the early-1980s great explosion of pop music [...] to have any real impact". <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> called both albums [...] "technically stunning, reasonably catchy and crashingly hollow." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} side of Australia, in Perth, {{germinal}} punk rock act the Cheap Nasties, featuring singer-guitarist Kim Salmon, formed in August. In September 1976, the Saints became the first punk rock band outside the U.S. to release a recording, the single [...] "(I'm) Stranded". As with Patti Smith's debut, the band self-financed, packaged, and distributed the single. |work=The Age |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv-reviews/great-australian-albums/2007/08/17/1186857752215.html |accessdate=2007-09-22}} [...] "(I'm) Stranded" [...] had limited impact at home, but the British music press recognized it as a groundbreaking record. At the insistence of their superiors in the UK, EMI Australia signed the Saints. Meanwhile, Radio Birdman came out with a self-financed EP, Burn My Eye, in October. <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> critic Ian McCaleb later described the record as the [...] "archetype for the musical explosion that was about to occur".|$|E
500|$|... "The Best Thing" [...] {{was praised}} by music critics. AllMusic's Jack Rabid was {{extremely}} positive, {{calling it a}} [...] "true single with a chorus that is to swoon and croon for". Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins from <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> described the song as an [...] "engaging opener" [...] and lauded it and album track [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] for being catchy. Frank Tortorici from MTV News agreed, and predicted that it would likely [...] "succeed at radio if given a chance". Calling it [...] "sensuous", Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club claimed {{that the rest of}} Apartment Life does not match the quality of [...] "The Best Thing", but also stated that the entire album [...] "never slips too far" [...] because the end product includes [...] "impeccably tasteful performances".|$|E
500|$|Subterranean Jungle, {{produced}} by Ritchie Cordell and Glen Kolotkin, {{was released in}} 1983. According to <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press,</b> it brought the band [...] "back to where they once belonged: junky '60s pop adjusted for current tastes", which among other things meant [...] "easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once Ramones dogma." [...] Billy Rogers, who had performed with Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, played drums on the album's second single, a cover of the Chambers Brothers' [...] "Time Has Come Today", becoming the only song showing three different drummers: Rogers on recording, Marky on album credits and Richie on video clip. Subterranean Jungle peaked at number83 in the United States—it {{would be the last}} album by the band to crack the Billboard Top100. In 2002, Rhino Records released a new version of it with seven bonus tracks.|$|E
500|$|According to the <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Record Guide, [...] "the Pistols and manager/provocateur Malcolm McLaren {{challenged}} {{every aspect}} and precept of modern music-making, thereby inspiring countless groups {{to follow their}} cue onto stages around the world. A confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands." [...] Critic Toby Creswell locates {{the primary source of}} inspiration somewhat differently. Noting that [...] "mage to the contrary, the Pistols were very serious about music", he argues, [...] "The real rebel yell came from Jones' guitars: a mass wall of sound based on the most simple, retro guitar riffs. Essentially, the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the '60s had demonstrated—you don't need technique to make rock & roll. In a time when music had been increasingly complicated and defanged, the Sex Pistols' generational shift caused a real revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Running to Stand Still" [...] earned {{critical}} praise upon The Joshua Trees release, {{which itself}} received very favourable reviews {{and went on}} to become the group's best-selling album. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "After the first few times through , you notice the remarkable music... It sounds like a lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when that realization hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power." [...] In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that [...] "A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams." [...] The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best. [...] The 1991 <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Record Guide, however, said that the song [...] "has mood but no presence".|$|E
500|$|Dee Dee {{claimed to}} have left the {{sessions}} without recording anything. [...] "We {{had been working for}} at least fourteen or fifteen hours a day for thirteen days straight and we still hadn't recorded one note of music," [...] he wrote in his autobiography. After supposedly hearing that Johnny had returned to New York, Dee Dee wrote that he and Marky Ramone booked a flight and returned home as well. [...] "To this day, I still have no idea how they made the album End of the Century, or who actually played bass on it." [...] Dee Dee's account contradicts much of the band's collective account from the 1982 <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> interview, where the band stated that the only track that Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover of [...] "Baby, I Love You"; as the band, save for Joey, had gone home after cutting basic tracks {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|The album expands on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work with refined musical details and occasionally slower songs. In The Rough Guide to Rock (2003), music journalist Alex Ogg writes that The Afghan Whigs were [...] "managing to balance volume with subtlety" [...] amid the burgeoning grunge music scene. The album's music incorporates heavy counterpoint rhythms, indie rock harmonics, wah-wah and slide guitars, and staccato riffs with funk, metal, and blues influences. Chicago Tribune writer Brad Webber compares its melodies to those of [...] "later Hüsker Dü". Option perceives influences from [...] "ex-indie guitar bands" [...] such as Dinosaur Jr. and Nirvana in the songs' [...] "catch-iness and in the arrangements' juxtaposition of frenzy and laziness." [...] David Sprague of the <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> comments that the band's instrumentation [...] "contriv panoramic images through judicious use of wah-wah guitar ... and the tribal drumbeats with which Steven Earle invokes an air of ritualistic surrender." ...|$|E
500|$|The album has had [...] "a slow {{progress}} to critical darlinghood"; {{for the most}} part, audiences have remained nonplussed. According to Simon Goddard, most critics regard it as [...] " [...] defining avant-garde masterpiece". The Rolling Stone Album Guide considers The Marble Index the point in Nico's discography where [...] "the difficult listening starts", and the album is [...] "pretty amazing for it". Anthony Carew of About.com called it [...] "a suite of rootless songs written with little precedent" [...] and [...] "an astonishing haunting, {{the work of a}} woman who, even whilst alive, seemed a lot like a ghost". Anthony Thornton of NME called it an [...] "artistic triumph": [...] "Bleak but beautiful, this album remains the most fitting embodiment of her doomed glamour." [...] According to Spin, [...] "Few records, before or since, have sounded lonelier, spookier, or more desolate". <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> described it as [...] "one of the scariest records ever made".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice {{that you want to}} take her home and give her a shampoo". In The <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E
500|$|Among {{retrospective}} reviews, Fact {{noted that}} Escape was [...] "eclipsed by {{the antics of}} the new school" [...] {{and that it had}} [...] "tumbled off of most casual fans' bucket lists." [...] According to AllMusic, the album was a [...] "vast improvement over the previous year's debut" [...] with [...] "a countless amount of memorable lines and productions, and has held up over time better than the debut", but that it was not [...] "a conceptual masterpiece." [...] The reviewer called [...] "Freaks Come Out at Night" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] classics, and said that [...] "We Are Whodini" [...] "distills the essence of the group more than the other groundbreaking tracks here, and still retains a sense of freshness." [...] <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> found the album [...] "airy without being simple", and called it appealing and innovative. Fact placed Escape at number 98 on their list of top 1980s albums, calling it [...] "diverting from end to end – something Spoonie G, The Cold Crush Brothers and The Furious Five conspicuously failed to deliver." ...|$|E
500|$|The songs discuss {{dysfunctional}} {{intimate relationships}} and sexual deviancy, and feature themes {{of pleasure and}} guilt. They are narrated {{from the perspective of}} a broken sinner and [...] with sinister and narcissistic tones. Dulli's lyrics incorporate haunting refrains and express angst and melodrama. His baritone vocals are moaningly husky and feature falsetto wails. Daniel Fidler of Spin compares Dulli's vocals on the album to those of [...] "a young Paul Westerberg [...]" [...] David Sprague of the <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> calls Congregation a [...] "strangely flamboyant" [...] album that showcases [...] "Dulli's metamorphosis from everypunk wallflower to rakish scoundrel with a [...]" [...] Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls Dulli [...] "a truly magnetic presence" [...] and writes of his performance on the album, [...] "by turns predator ('Tonight') and prey ('I'm Her Slave'), he's the guy your parents always warned you about, delivering each syllable of his remarkable lyrics with equal measures of innuendo and venom." [...] Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody comments that his lyrics are [...] "full of stifling dissatisfaction and boozy philosophy".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Rhythm Killers are typified by deep bass, {{striking}} beats, low-frequency grooves, improvisational rhythms, electronic percussion, disco-era string synthesizers, aggressive guitar riffs, and stylistic influences from reggae, early hip hop, downtown music, hard rock, and worldbeat genres. They are densely layered {{in a fashion}} similar to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production. Bud Kliment of <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> said they comprise a groove-oriented [...] "song cycle" [...] that is [...] "heavy-bottomed from start to finish". Similar to the album's funk instrumentation, the guest rappers have exclamatory, confrontational tones and percussive vocals. The vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable scratches and both African- and Latin-influenced percussion, which resulted in cross-rhythms during the songs. Carl Matthews of the Baltimore Afro-American observed [...] "a noticeable looseness in the vocals and a sort of P-Funk quality to the rhythm tracks." [...] Mat Smith from Melody Maker said the enthusiastic music was driven by a [...] "schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "This Is the Day" [...] {{was written}} by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, with the latter two also serving as producers. Musicians Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade served as the mixers, with Matthew Ellard being an {{assistant}} to them; additionally, Bob Ludwig finalized the mastering. Additionally, fellow musician James Iha contributes backing vocals to the track. A pop and alternative pop song, Durand sings about an ended relationship, with the chorus consisting of her saying, [...] "She's never com-ing back". Noting the use of [...] "60s-ish horns", Jack Rabid from AllMusic called its genre [...] "la-la-la pop personified". The addition of horns was brand new for Ivy, {{as they tried to}} incorporate more instruments into the songs on Apartment Life. Also regarding the horn section, Kurt B. Reighley from CMJ New Music Monthly joked that the Smiths must have [...] "overlooked" [...] the song and its [...] "punchy melody". Agreeing, Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins from <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> compared it to the same group and called it a [...] "jaunty" [...] track.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' loud, fast, {{straightforward}} musical {{style was}} influenced by pop music that the band members {{grew up listening to}} in the 1950s and 1960s, including classic rock groups such as the Beach Boys, the Who, the Beatles, the Kinks, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival; bubblegum acts like the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Ohio Express; and girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las. They also drew on the harder rock sound of the MC5, Black Sabbath, the Stooges and the New York Dolls, now known as seminal protopunk bands. The Ramones' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s. [...] "We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard," [...] Joey once explained. [...] "In 1974 everything was tenth-generation Elton John, or overproduced, or just junk. Everything was long jams, long guitar solos.... We missed music like it used to be." [...] Ira Robbins and Scott Isler of <b>Trouser</b> <b>Press</b> describe the result: ...|$|E
