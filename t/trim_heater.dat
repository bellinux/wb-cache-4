40|$|A {{solar energy}} powered {{electrical}} generator utilizing a Subatmospheric Brayton cycle engine is examined. The generator {{consists of a}} subatmospheric, Brayton-cycle engine and a permanent magnet (PM) alternator. The electrical power is generated by an alternator driven directly by the Brayton-cycle engine rotating group. Features that enhance reliability and performance include air foil bearings on both the Brayton-cycle engine rotating group and the PM alternator, an atmospheric-pressure solar receiver and gas-fired <b>trim</b> <b>heater,</b> and a high temperature recuperator. The subatmospheric Brayton-cycle engine design is based on that of the gas fired heat pump engine...|$|E
40|$|Last year saw the {{successful}} demonstration of an autonomously controlled two-stage turbo-Brayton cooler. The electronics developed for this demonstration {{evolved from the}} seminal work of the NICMOS cryocooler, the first flight-qualified turbo-Brayton cryocooler. Two key features of the electronics are {{the ability to control}} temperature without the use of <b>trim</b> <b>heaters</b> and the ability to recover expander power back to the main power bus. The development of the control and power electronics for this two-stage cooler was the first step toward a space qualifiable design. The technical challenges, solu-tions and performance of the electronics for the two-stage turbo-Brayton cooler are presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA novel amine capture {{technology}} for CO 2 emissions {{has been developed}} by Huaneng/Xi’an Thermal Power Research Institute. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), {{on behalf of the}} U. S. -China Clean Energy Research Center, has evaluated the technology using location-specific economic parameters to reflect power generation loss from a coal-fired power generation plant due to amine regeneration, the necessary utility constraints and investment, and the constraints of the location. The conceptual design used for cost estimates consists of a pre-absorption cooler (cooling by injection of water directly into the flue gas was not feasible because of 100 % flue gas humidity post-flue gas desulfurizer), an absorber with a spray stage to minimize evaporative amine losses; an economizing heat exchanger and <b>trim</b> <b>heaters</b> and coolers: a stripper with a reboiler and condenser to recover absorbed CO 2; a five-stage CO 2 compression train with intercooling and water removal; and an ion exchange process to control build-up of heat-stable salts by treating a bleed stream from the lean amine stream. We conclude that Huaneng's novel amine composition, because of the use of hindered and tertiary amines, has a lower heat of regeneration and hence reduces the power generation penalty. Further, we assess that the hindered and tertiary amines are less susceptible to thermal and oxidative degradation, although they are still susceptible to degradation by reaction with CO 2. We estimate the reduced power generation penalty and reduced solvent degradation gives a modest but tangible cost advantage relative to 30 % MEA. Among the location-specific constraints we have identified are: limited ability to cool incoming flue gas by water injection because of high humidity; and poor soil conditions that would require extensive civil engineering prior to plant construction. These differences we assess will increase the cost of implementing an amine-based capture technology over costs based on assumed greenfield construction...|$|R
2500|$|Retailing {{for around}} DM 2,500, the KR200 was {{considered}} an instant success with almost 12,000 built during its first year, which was the highest annual production for Kabinenroller models. A maximum speed in excess of [...] despite a claimed power output of only [...] reflected the vehicle's light weight and low aerodynamic drag. An [...] "Export" [...] package included a two-tone paint scheme, painted hubcaps, a fully <b>trimmed</b> interior, a <b>heater,</b> a clock, and a sunshade for the canopy.|$|R

2500|$|... 1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Oldsmobile Fiesta wagons (based on the 88 platform, but {{retaining}} {{most of the}} 1961 wagon's rear styling) {{each had}} their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. [...] Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and <b>trim.</b> [...] <b>Heaters</b> became standard equipment on all models, and the push-button controls were located {{to the right of}} the steering wheel column. [...] Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called [...] "Summer Ventilation", which replaced the pull level type vents. [...] This control panel was located on the left of the steering column. [...] Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch. [...] These cars also sported round dash vents for the A/C airflow deliver. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with [...] "OLDSMOBILE" [...] lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model's nomenclature on the insert.|$|R
50|$|The Ranger's base trim {{appointments}} included arm rests, {{a cigarette}} lighter, rear-view mirror, two coat hangers and black rubber floor mats. On the exterior, Rangers received chrome around the {{rear quarter panel}} cove molding. Two-tone paint was also optional. The main visual cue {{that makes it possible}} {{to tell the difference between}} most Rangers and the upmarket Pacer was the lack of stainless trim on the front doors and fenders. A very rare, optional, Ranger-only door trim was available from dealers early in the model year to be used together with the Pacer fender <b>trim.</b> A basic <b>heater</b> (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at $417), along with seat belts, warning lights, automatic trunk opener, and rear door child safety lock covers.|$|R
40|$|Air {{curtains}} {{are often}} used to reduce the energy transfer across high traffic doorways of cold storage facilities and cold food sections of warehouse type supermarkets. A test method and facility were developed to quantify and visualize the performance of air curtains covering a doorway between a simulated cold storage building and the simulated surrounding ambient conditions. This method {{was used to determine}} the effectiveness of horizontal air flow recirculatory air curtains compared to an open doorway. Tracer gas methods have been used in the past to determine losses but this method is designed to measure the actual energy flow through the doorway. Two environmental calorimeters were configured side-by-side with a 2. 1 m by 2. 1 m doorway separating high temperature and low temperature spaces. The higher temperature calorimeter contained PID controlled heaters and steam generators to maintain temperature and humidity conditions. The power input to these and all other electrical devices as well as the power loss through the calorimeter walls were measured. The difference at steady state between these values yields the energy transfer through the doorway. The lower temperature side contained a cooling coil located in a wind tunnel and PID controlled <b>trim</b> <b>heaters</b> to finely control the temperature. The coolant flow rate and temperature difference across the coil were measured along with the power consumption of all electrical devices and heat transfer through the walls. The difference between these values yields the heat transfer through the doorway which was used as a check for the calculation from the higher temperature calorimeter. The heat transfer was first measured through the open doorway with no air curtain with the warm side controlled to 24 ºC and 60 % relative humidity and the cold side controlled to 4 ºC. The horizontal air flow, recirculatory air curtain was then installed, optimized, and tested at the same ambient conditions. The air curtain reduced the heat transfer between the calorimeters from 35. 7 kW to 10. 3 kW yielding an effectiveness of 71 %. There is clear visual evidence that was measured by air thermocouple grids and shown in temperature gradient plots which exemplifies the effectiveness of the air curtain at creating a barrier between the warm and cold sides. The flow of warm air through the top of the doorway and the return flow of cold air through the bottom of the doorway with no air curtain was clearly visible and the temperature gradients became diagonal to horizontal. Upon air curtain activation, the temperature gradients became vertical showing that there was little energy transfer from side to side. In addition to energy savings, there is a comparable benefit in the reduction of humidity transfer which helps to prevent icing and condensation on products and on the floor. The reduction in humidity transfer also helps to prevent frosting of the cooling coils which results in fewer defrost cycles being necessary. Reduced frosting of cooling coils improves performance and further reduces energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) had stringent requirements that made the thermal design unique. To meet instrument stability requirements the system had to be designed to keep temperatures of all components within acceptable limits without heater cycling. Although the spacecraft remains at a fixed 22 sun angle at L 2, the variations in solar constant, property degradation, and bus voltage range all significantly affect the temperature. Large portions of the fuel lines are external to the structure and all components are mounted to non-conductive composite structure. These two facts made the sensitivity to the MLI effective emissivity and bus temperature very high. Approximately two years prior to launch the {{propulsion system}} was redesigned to meet MAP requirements. The new design utilized hardware that was already installed {{in order to meet}} schedule constraints. The spacecraft design and the thermal requirements were changed to compensate for inadequacies of the existing hardware. The propulsion system consists of fuel lines, fill and drain lines/valve, eight thrusters, a HXCM, and a propulsion tank. A voltage regulator was added to keep critical components within limits. Software was developed to control the operational <b>heaters.</b> <b>Trim</b> resistors were put in series with each operational heater circuits and the tank survival heater. A highly sophisticated test program, which included real time model correlation, was developed to determine trim resistors sizes. These trim resistors were installed during a chamber break and verified during thermal balance testing...|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{redesign}} in 1970, the hardtop {{body style}} started {{to drop in}} sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM {{did not want to}} drop it leaving it without a mid-sized two-door. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus for 1972, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car. This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name [...] "Rambler" [...] removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment (also shared with the Rebel Machine), individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright <b>trim</b> for pedals, <b>heater,</b> AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high level of equipment, the public saw it as the previous model. The only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations. The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Matador Machine sold in the U.S. and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador/Rebel model produced in Mexico.|$|R
