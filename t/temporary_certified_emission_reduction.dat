40|$|Abstract Poverty, {{hunger and}} demand for {{agricultural}} land have driven local communities to overexploit forest resources throughout Ethiopia. Forests surrounding the township of Humbo were largely destroyed by the late 1960 s. In 2004, World Vision Australia and World Vision Ethiopia identified forestry-based carbon sequestration as a potential means to stimulate community development while engaging in environmental restoration. After two years of consultation, planning and negotiations, the Humbo Com-munity-based Natural Regeneration Project began imple-mentation—the Ethiopian organization’s first carbon sequestration initiative. The Humbo Project assists com-munities affected by environmental degradation including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and flooding {{with an opportunity to}} benefit from carbon markets while reducing poverty and restoring the local agroecosystem. Involving the regeneration of 2, 728 ha of degraded native forests, it brings social, economic and ecological benefits—facilitating adaptation to a changing climate and generating <b>temporary</b> <b>certified</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> (tCERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism. A key feature of the project has been facilitating communities to embrace new techniques and take responsibility for large-scale environmental change, most importantly involving Farmer Managed Nat-ural Regeneration (FMNR). This technique is low-cost, replicable, and provides direct benefits within a short time. Communities were able to harvest fodder and firewood within a year of project initiation and wild fruits and other non-timber forest products within three years. Farmers are using agroforestry for both environmental restoration and income generation. Establishment of user rights and local cooperatives has generated community ownership and enthusiasm for this project—empowering the community to more sustainably manage their communal lands...|$|R
40|$|In Ethiopia, exclosures in landscapes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important to improving ecosystem services and reversing biodiversity losses. The present {{study was conducted in}} Gomit watershed, northern Ethiopia, to: (i) investigate the changes in vegetation composition, diversity and aboveground biomass and carbon following the establishment of exclosures; and (ii) analyse the economic returns of aboveground carbon sequestration and assess the perception of local communities on land degradation and exclosures. A space-for-time substitution approach was used to detect the changes in aboveground carbon, species composition, and diversity. Exclosures of 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 7 -years-old and a communal grazing land were selected. Household surveys, key informant interviews, and a financial analysis were used to assess the perception of local communities and the value of exclosure impacts, respectively. Significant (P = 0. 049) differences in species diversity and considerable increases in aboveground carbon (ranged from 0. 6 to 4. 2 t C ha- 1), CO 2 storage (varied between 2. 1 and 15. 3 t CO 2 ha- 1), woody species composition, and richness (ranged from five to 28) were observed following the establishment of exclosures. Exclosures generated <b>temporary</b> <b>certified</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> (tCER) of 3. 4, 2. 1, 7. 5, 12. 6, 12. 5, and 15. 3 Mg CO 2 ha- 1 after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The net present value (NPV) of the aboveground carbon sequestered in exclosures ranged from US$ 6. 6 to US$ 37. 0 per hectare and increased with exclosure duration. At a watershed level, 51. 4 Mg C ha- 1 can be sequestered, which represents 188. 6 Mg CO 2 ha- 1, resulting in tCER of 139. 4 Mg CO 2 ha- 1 and NPV of US$ 478. 3 per hectare. This result would suggest that exclosures can potentially improve local communities’ livelihoods beyond rehabilitating degraded lands if carbon stored in exclosures is traded. Communities in the watershed demonstrated that exclosures are effective in restoring degraded lands and they are benefiting from increased fodder production and reduced impacts of soil erosion. However, the respondents are also concerned over the sustainability of exclosure land management, as further expansion of exclosures aggravates degradation of remaining communal grazing lands and causes fuel wood shortages. This suggests that the sustainability of exclosure land management can be attained only if these critical concerns are addressed by a joint effort among government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and communities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzed}} the financial attractiveness of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation and Reforestation (CDM A/R) in irrigated agricultural settings. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated {{by analyzing the}} case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i. e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30, 000 m 3 /ha, to reflect {{the reality of a}} high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794 USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L. had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. <b>Temporary</b> <b>Certified</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Reductions</b> (tCER) ranged within 399 – 702 USD/ha after the assumed 7 -year crediting period and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65 % with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured − 10 % and 61 % when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26, 500 m 3 /ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4. 76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3 – 30 % of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15, 300 m 3 /ha/year at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, {{developed}} countries can only tap mitigation opportunities {{in developing countries}} by investing in projects under the Clean Development Mechanism. Yet Clean Development Mechanism investments have so far failed to reach many of the high-potential sectors identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This raises doubts about whether the Clean Development Mechanism can generate an adequate supply of credits from the limited areas where it has proved successful. This paper examines the current trajectory of mitigation projects entering the Clean Development Mechanism pipeline and projects it forward {{under the assumption that}} the diffusion of the Clean Development Mechanism will follow a path similar to other innovations. Projections are then compared with pre-Clean Development Mechanism predictions of the mechanism’s potential market size to discern whether limits on the types of projects entering the pipeline have limited the expected supply of <b>certified</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions.</b> Parameter tests suggest {{that this is not the}} case and that currently identified Clean Development Mechanism investments will generate offsets in excess of early model predictions.
