5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> neodymium and lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the male, {{leading to a}} more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the male. Moulting appears {{to take place in}} stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. His choice of lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. Grove comments that Massenet's songs, though pleasing and impeccable in craftsmanship, are less inventive <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Bizet and less distinctive <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Duparc and Fauré.|$|E

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other felids. The slightly curved claws lack {{a protective}} sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This {{is a major}} point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E

(2) a. The fingers having the highest incidence of the B type fingerprint were the index fingers of both hands. b. The fingers with the highest incidence of the S type fingerprint were the left small finger and the right middle finger. c. The thumbs on both fingers showed the highest incidence of the ODS type fingerprint. d. The highest incidence of the OW type fingerprint was shown by the ring fingers of both hands. (3) When the five fingers of the left hand were examined, the incidences of the fingerprints of B, S and ODS types were lower among the female inhabitants of Ichiharagun, and the incidence of the OW type fingerprint was higher among them, <b>than</b> among <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Aomori and Akita Prefectures in Tohoku District.

5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> dogs. With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, coyote scat tends to be smaller than wolf scat.|$|E

When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E
5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.|$|E
