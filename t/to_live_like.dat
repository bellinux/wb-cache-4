25|$|In Islam, {{scholars}} of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed {{discussions on the}} status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs.|$|E
25|$|Washington's six-point plan {{included}} impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; {{promotion of}} commerce; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; presidential authority to give presents; and punishing those who violated Indian rights. The government appointed agents, such as Benjamin Hawkins, to live among the Indians {{and to teach}} them through example and instruction, how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> whites. While living among the Choctaw for nearly 30 years, Hawkins married Lavinia Downs, a Choctaw woman. As the people had a matrilineal system of property and hereditary leadership, their children were born into the mother's clan and gained their status from her people. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, a number of Scots-Irish traders lived among the Choctaw and married high-status women. Choctaw chiefs saw these as strategic alliances to build stronger relationships with the Americans in a changing environment that influenced ideas of capital and property. The children of such marriages were Choctaw, first and foremost. Some of the sons were educated in Anglo-American schools and became important interpreters and negotiators for Choctaw-US relations.|$|E

500|$|The poems, many {{of which}} had a theme of youth, were {{inspired}} {{in part by the}} works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The largest inspiration on Poe, however, came from the work of Lord Byron; the character of the title poem [...] "Tamerlane" [...] has a daughter named [...] "Ada", named after Byron's own daughter Ada Lovelace. Poe admired Byron both for his poetry and for his rebellious personality. John Allan blamed Poe's interest in Byron for his licentiousness. Some biographers suggest that Poe's wandering to Boston and joining the Army represent a need <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> an outcast inspired by Byron.|$|E

500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, the Experimental College began a slow decline. Many {{students}} couldn't afford tuition, fewer had additional savings, and several dropped out. Along with books and campus salaries, the Experimental College became a budgetary luxury during a time of economic need for both students and the state, and its funding was in jeopardy. Meiklejohn started an Experimental College interest-fee loan fund for unfunded students, and asked advisers and monied students to donate. During this period, some sophomores absconded the college for two weeks <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> the vagrant hobos who traveled the Midwest by rail looking for work. They returned to write papers about their experiences, which Meiklejohn is said to have appreciated for its syncretism of experience and the great questions grounded in their readings.|$|E

She really stands out due to the dark background." [...] He believed that New Cutie Honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters' expositions, and that Honey instead [...] "makes her own moves, and she carries the whole story". On the relative weakness of male characters in the series, he said, [...] "Honey-chan is like a mother, and she loves to protect weak men.

500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{said the}} episode felt like [...] "a {{bit of a}} place-holder" [...] compared to other episodes in the season, but that [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] included amusing scenes and introduced new ways to mock bureaucracy [...] "without every feeling like the sly satire it secretly is". Kandell also said he enjoyed the jokes at Leslie's and Jerry's expense. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said every character was at their best, and that he particularly enjoyed Ron's taunting of Leslie once it was made clear he was only joking. Gallagher said the [...] "only thing about this episode I didn't love" [...] {{was the way the}} subplot involving Tom's investment with the nightclub ended, because she felt it [...] "started off strong, but kind of went nowhere." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was not a stand-out, but offered great character moments between Leslie and Ron. Fowler said Tom's desire <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> a hip hop mogul was funny [...] "but not always engaging", and that he enjoyed the [...] "little moments" [...] between Andy and April.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the reality series {{resulted}} {{in the development of}} several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khloé in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. [...] "It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. [...] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami," [...] Harbert added. The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002. The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010, and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013. Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "king".|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>like</b> a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E
