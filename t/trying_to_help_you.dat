40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of audio {{feedback}} on assignments through the case study of a politics course, highlighting a number of pedagogical benefits. In particular, and using student testimonies, it argues that audio feedback provides a more personal feel to feedback; criticism, it appears, is easier to accept in the spoken word – as one student suggests, you know the marker is ‘not being harsh’ and is ‘just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> really’. In addition, the paper notes the chief practical benefit of audio feedback: it reduces the overall time spent by lecturers in providing comments. While this paper is positive in favour of audio feedback throughout, it also discusses some potential challenges including anonymous marking – which affects the relationship between marker and student – {{and the fact that}} one size does not fit all, with different students preferring different types of feedback. The paper also attempts to provide practical tips to professionals wishing to use this method of feedback...|$|E

5000|$|Like many {{ellipsis}} mechanisms, pseudogapping challenges {{theories of}} syntax. One major difficulty concerns the syntactic {{status of the}} elided material. Under normal circumstances, this material often does not qualify as a constituent. Phrase structure grammars that posit the constituent as the fundamental unit of syntax must therefore seek some means of accounting {{for the fact that}} the elided material (= the pseudogapped material) does not appear to be a constituent. One widespread account of the phenomenon is to assume movement followed by ellipsis. The remnant is moved out of the encompassing constituent, so that the encompassing constituent can then be elided. The following trees are representative of the movement plus ellipsis approach (the details will vary); they illustrate the second part of the sentence Phil <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you,</b> but he didn't me: ...|$|R
