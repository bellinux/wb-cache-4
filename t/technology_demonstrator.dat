These improvements have reportedly increased the Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and increased the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E
5|$|Su-37: <b>Technology</b> <b>demonstrator,</b> {{converted}} from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a glass cockpit, the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrator,</b> unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrator</b> {{designed for}} the United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated canards and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a multi-role aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due {{to the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, and the resultant Su-37 was used as a <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrator.</b> A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E

25|$|The first F-15B was {{converted}} into a short takeoff and landing, maneuver <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrator</b> aircraft.

It was used as a short-takeoff/maneuver-technology demonstrator (S/MTD).|$|E
25|$|CH-46X : Replacement {{helicopter}} {{based on}} the Boeing Model 360, this Advance <b>Technology</b> <b>Demonstrator</b> from the 1980s never entered production.

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{intended to}} replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder, it was downgraded to a <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrator</b> program in 1974. Between 1974 and 1977, several SRAAM missiles were launched in tests. In 1980, the knowledge gained from the SRAAM project became the British contribution to the multinational ASRAAM missile project.|$|E

40|$|Power {{electronics}} technology demontrators {{for electric}} vehicle drivetrains are primarily designed {{to demonstrate the}} feasibility of novel technical approaches rather than for simple integration into vehicle communication networks. Documentation related to integration issues is often limited. Communication protocols are heterogeneous and tend to change frequently during the development process. Higher level software functions are often not fully implemented in the electronic control unit firmwares. This paper presents the design and implementation of a vehicle control unit software, {{that is based on}} a rapid prototyping approach. The software design is flexible and modular enough to cope with the specific characteristics of <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrators.</b> Its features enable to test and recursively integrate these components into a vehicle. The software was employed to integrate a complete powertrain, exclusively composed of power electronics <b>technology</b> <b>demonstrators,</b> into a converted sports car...|$|R

CNTs help improve the structural performance of the vessel, resulting in a lightweight 8,000lb boat that can carry a payload of 15,000lb over a range of 2,500 miles.|$|E
25|$|As a {{precursor}} to a formal LVS replacement programme a number of manufacturers co-operated with the USMC to build and evaluate an Advanced <b>Technology</b> <b>Demonstrator</b> (ATD). The ATD was built during 1998 at the Nevada Automotive Test Centre (NATC). LVS Modification Demonstrators (LVS-MDs) were also built, these integrating commercially proven automotive components and technologies.|$|E
