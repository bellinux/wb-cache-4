5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to <b>time</b> <b>slots,</b> as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

The English adaption of the episodes were released in North America by Viz Media, and began airing on September 10, 2005 on Cartoon Network's Toonami. On September 20, 2008, Cartoon Network ended its Toonami block, but the channel continued sporadically airing episodes of Naruto in the <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> originally occupied by Toonami's programming till January 31, 2009 when episode 209, the last episode to air in US, was shown.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that there were not many <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E

An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played with Judas Priest in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991.|$|E
5|$|Wheel of Fortune premiered on January 6, 1975, at 10:30am (9:30 Central) on NBC. Lin Bolen, {{then the}} head of daytime programming, {{purchased}} the show from Griffin to compensate him for canceling the original Jeopardy! series, which had one year remaining on its contract. Jeopardy! aired its final episode on the Friday before Wheels premiere. The original Wheel aired on NBC, in varying <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> between 10:30 am and noon, until June 30, 1989. Throughout that version's run, episodes were generally 30 minutes in length, except for six weeks of shows aired between December 1975 and January 1976 which were 60 minutes in length. NBC announced the cancellation of the show in August 1980, but it stayed on the air following a decision to cut the duration of The David Letterman Show from 90 to 60 minutes. The network Wheel moved to CBS on July 17, 1989, and remained there until January 14, 1991. After that, it briefly returned to NBC, replacing Let's Make a Deal, but was canceled permanently on September 20 of that year.|$|E

25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as time-division multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between <b>time</b> <b>slots.</b> Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E

30|$|Algorithm 1 {{outlines}} our proposed dynamic <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation algorithm, (dynamic-FAA). Table 1 displays all {{the variables}} {{used in the}} algorithm. The algorithm starts with some arbitrary (e.g., equal) <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation ϕ^l(δ_(t)) and iteratively improves total system utility function in a while loop. The while loop iterates over consecutive frames, and for each frame t corresponding to a DoF vector δ_(t), the reduced convex problem presented in (19)–(23) is solved (lines 7.1 through 7.6). The solution provides current <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocations, ϕ^l(δ_(t)), for that particular frame, which also updates the average <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocation ϕ^l(δ_(t)) through an exponential moving average (line 7.4). Therefore, the algorithm provides better <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> allocations as <b>time</b> moves forward.|$|R
