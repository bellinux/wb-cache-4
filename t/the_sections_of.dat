5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process.

5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> I-94 {{from the}} Indiana state {{line to the}} M-63 {{interchange}} was designated {{as part of the}} West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. The West Michigan Pike originated in efforts in the 1910s to improve a highway along {{the western part of the}} Lower Peninsula of Michigan and to increase tourism along the Lake Michigan shore. The auto trail was eventually superseded by US12 and US31 after the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water {{south of the}} causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

5|$|The Government {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the Act dealing with disputation by {{petition}} encompassed {{any question about}} the validity of an election, including the eligibility of a candidate, and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Department {{conducted}} an international design competition for Texas {{and the winner}} was the Naval Construction & Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed Texass forward turret {{on the port side}} and her aft turret to starboard. The need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. This significantly limited the gun's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun's arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged.|$|E
5|$|The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge {{commissioned}} by John, Earl Spencer, {{who had recently}} acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping, and boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> highway between SH-33 and Canton {{was made}} part of US-270, and SH-44's northernmost section was {{truncated}} to Canton. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> road east of Driftwood {{became part of}} SH-11, so its northern terminus was truncated to US-60 in Fairview. On March 29, 1937, the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>section</b> <b>of</b> route was transferred to SH-58.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> {{the route}} of US31 in Michigan has been {{dedicated}} several times to various organizations. The route of US33 in the state, {{which at the time}} was concurrent with US31, was dedicated as the Blue & Gray Trail in 1938 to honor veterans of the American Civil War. The Blue Star Memorial Highway designation was applied to the highway to honor those serving in the military. The designation was dedicated on October 10, 1948 by the State Highway Commissioner Charles Ziegler.|$|E
5|$|The {{segments}} of the road between Brighton and Farmington were upgraded in 1956. The MSHD initially signed the various freeways as Interstates in 1959, and US16 through the Farmington area gained the additional I-96 numbering. Two years later, the business route through Farmington was redesignated as a business loop of I-96 instead of US16. The final connection for I-96 between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962, and the US16 designation was decommissioned in the state. <b>The</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> highway through the Detroit metro area were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations.|$|E
5|$|When M-43 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} by July 1, 1919, it ran from M-17 in Kalamazoo to Hastings. It also extended north to Ionia and Stanton before turning east through Ithaca to St. Charles. In 1929, {{the western end}} was extended from Kalamazoo to South Haven, with a section still under construction. By the end of 1930, <b>the</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> M-43 north and east of Woodbury were redesignated as parts of other highways. The Woodbury–Stanton segment was renumbered M-14, and the Stanton– St. Charles highway became M-57. In 1938, the road was extended to the east, replacing the routing of M-39 from Woodbury {{all the way to}} East Lansing where it intersected US16 as it existed on Grand River Avenue.|$|E
