5|$|After {{ownership}} of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Alliance</b> for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. <b>The</b> <b>Alliance</b> serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn <b>the</b> <b>Alliance</b> serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, <b>the</b> <b>Alliance</b> helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active {{during the day and}} at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, <b>the</b> <b>alliance</b> {{was much}} more {{valuable}} to the Commonwealth than to Prussia.
