5|$|Whereas Asynchronous <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{are typical}} data-link {{protocols}} for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E

5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous <b>Transfer</b> <b>Mode</b> (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray <b>transfer</b> <b>mode,</b> pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

500|$|The {{desirable}} rate of shielding-gas flow depends {{primarily on}} weld geometry, speed, current, {{the type of}} gas, and the metal <b>transfer</b> <b>mode.</b> Welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials, since gas disperses more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas must be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirementsfor the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes, about 10L/min (20ft³/h) is generally suitable, whereas for globular transfer, around 15L/min (30ft³/h) is preferred. [...] The spray transfer variation normally requires more shielding-gas flow because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool. Typical gas-flow amounts are approximately 2025L/min (4050ft³/h).|$|E
