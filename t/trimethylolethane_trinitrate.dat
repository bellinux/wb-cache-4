For composite rocket propellants, dioctyl adipate, isodecyl pelargonate, and dioctyl phthalate are often used. Plasticizers can also be other energetic materials (common in smokeless powders), e.g. nitroglycerine, butanetriol trinitrate, dinitrotoluene, <b>trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> diethylene glycol dinitrate, triethylene glycol dinitrate, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal, 2,2,2-trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether, and others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (TMETN), {{also known}} as metriol trinitrate (METN, MTN, METRTN) or nitropentaglycerin, is a nitrate ester. It is a high {{explosive}} similar to nitroglycerin. It is a transparent oily liquid, colorless to light brown. It is odorless. It is used in some solid propellants and smokeless powders as a plasticizer. Its chemical formula is CH3-C(CH2-O-NO2)3.|$|E
50|$|TME is an {{intermediate}} {{in the production}} of alkyd and polyester resins, powder coating resins, synthetic lubricants based on polyol esters, stabilizers for plastics, plasticizers, and pigment coatings based on titanium dioxide. Trimethylolethane based resins have superior weatherability and resistance to alkali and heat. Trimethylolethane is used in some phase change materials. The typical composition is then 63 wt.% TME with 37 wt.% water. The mixture has melting point of 29.8 Â°C and heat of fusion 218 kJ/kg. Nitration of trimethylolethane gives <b>trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> an explosive, monopropellant, and energetic plasticizer.|$|E
