500|$|Carroll {{considered}} requesting de Barth's {{appointment as}} bishop, but {{decided against it}} because of de Barth's lack of theological study and reputation for having a quick temper. Carroll died in 1815, and his successor, Leonard Neale, offered de Barth the position of bishop, but de Barth declined it. In a letter to Neale, de Barth wrote <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not forward my objections [...] to the Holy See ... I will not accept, but will kneel down and devoutly put the bulls in the fire ... and then farewell, Monseigneur. Neither you nor anyone else shall ever know {{the corner of the}} globe where I shall vegetate the few years still left to me to live. Neale accepted de Barth's refusal, and the see remained vacant. In 1817, after Neale died, de Barth traveled to Baltimore to participate in the episcopal consecration of Neale's successor, Ambrose Maréchal.|$|E
500|$|In November 1921 Joseph {{organised}} the Morley {{forces to}} perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary {{of the church of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her Seven Two-Part Songs were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, A Hymn for Whitsuntide and A Festival Venite were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the Venite premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: [...] "Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like <b>that?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you are quite wrong". The Venite was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the Spectators critic thought it a [...] "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.|$|E

All three brothers took ballet lessons in their childhood, which Emanuel says [...] "hardened us and taught us <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something unusual, people will take potshots at you." [...] Emanuel {{and his brother}} Rahm frequently argue about healthcare policy.

2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do <b>that.</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
