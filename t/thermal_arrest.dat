By systematic research, TA in the NiCoMnAl alloy systems was raised up to 190 K, compared to the highest TA of 130 K in NiCoMnIn. For a selected alloy of Ni 40 Co 10 Mn 33 Al 17, magnetization measurements were performed under a pulsed high magnetic field, and the critical magnetic field-temperature phase diagram was determined. The magnetic phase diagram for Ni 50 -xCoxMn 50 -yAly was also established.

The Ni 85 Nb 15 was fully crystalline, {{with the majority}} of the grains composed of collections of primary dendrite arms. Both compositions were irradiated with 4 MeV Ni++ ions. The irradiation induced microstructures were examined by transmission electron microscopy and compared with thermally aged samples.

40|$|Double vacuum arc {{remelted}} NiTi ingots were {{vacuum induction}} remelted and subsequently atomized using a high-pressure gas stream. Powders were collected, loaded into cans, and hot isostatically pressed (HIP'ed). Prior to HIP'ing, powders of various known transformation temperatures (As), were precisely blended {{to achieve a}} desired intermediate transformation temperature (As). This intermediate As follows an empirical relationship which approximates a rule of mixtures based on weight fraction. As were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results for HIP'ed and high temperature annealed specimens indicate that this technique was accurate and reproducible for measuring the transformation temperature of smooth, nearly symmetrical DSC curves. DSC/DTA thermograms in the literature typically show a double peak exothermic-martensitic reaction which was different than the smooth peaks observed for the HIP'ed condition. The specific thermomechanical history performed on the P/M material resulted in the double peak exothermic reaction. To interpret the peaks, <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> experiments were conducted on both exothermic peaks, the results of which clearly support {{the existence of a}} premartensitic reaction. <b>Thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> experiments were also performed to analyze incomplete thermal cycles on both heating and cooling. <b>Thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> of the martensite reaction resulted in reduced energy absorbed for completion of the austenite reaction. Conversely, martensite energy was reduced by an arrest of the austenite reaction. However, reheating the sample revealed that the arrest split the austenite reaction into two distinct peaks, the split occurring at the temperature of the prior <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest.</b> These results and results of additional DSC experiments serve to emphasize the influence of thermomechanical history on the kinetics and energetics of the SME transformation. The P/M blending process technique was found to result in unprecedented control of the As temperature.

Interruption of the martensite-austenite phase transformation is connected with {{the reduction of the}} sample length after thermal cycle. If a total phase transformation took place in the complete thermal cycle following the interruption, then the sample length would return to its original length. Analysis of these results has shown that the <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> memory effect is a consequence of a stress-focusing effect and shape memory effect. The stress-focusing effect occurs when the phase transformation propagates radially in a cylindrical sample from the surface, inward to the center.

40|$|Allotropic {{transformation}} in uranium {{has been studied}} over a range of cooling rates from 5 to about 8000 °C/sec.

40|$|The {{constitution}} of the gold-rich region of the gold—cadmium diagram has been etudied by means of thermal analysis, optical microscopy and Debye-Scherrer X-ray films of high-temperature and quenched specimens. Five phases have been identified, α face-centred cubic, α 2 close-packed hexagonal, β' ordered body-centred cubic {{as well as two}} phases at low temperatures, α 1 face-centred tetragonal and α' face-centred cubic. The liquidus and solidus relationships have been found for the α, α 2 and β-phases by thermal analysis, the results being in good agreement with the X-ray and microscopical results. A eutectic horizontal representing the reaction α 2 + β' ⇌ liquid is found at 626. 5 °C. The β'-phase maximum is only just detectable, rising to 629 °C. From the X-ray evidence a peritectic horizontal, corresponding to the reaction α + liquid ⇌ α 2, is believed to exist between 633 °C and the eutectic temperature; the <b>thermal</b> <b>arrests</b> place it at 627 °C. The α 2 (α 2 + β') and (α 2 + β') β boundaries have been determined microscopically. Only a few experimental points have been obtained for the α + α 2 boundaries but the high-temperature X-ray films indicate that the boundaries of previous workers are in need of revision. The maximum solid solubility of cadmium in gold is 34 atomic % at 620 °C to 630 °C. The β'-phase narrows in composition range as temperature falls. The high-temperature X-ray films showed superlattice lines up to 624 °C and an estimate of the degree of ordering at 620 °C suggests the β-phase to be about 90 % ordered at this temperature. The α 1 -phase at 23 atomic % cadmium is disordered face- centred tetragonal when photographed at elevated temperatures. The absence of superlattice lines is contrary to previous work which describes the unit cell in quenched α 1, specimens as ordered (an anti-phase domain structure based on four fundamental tetragonal cells). It is conjectured that quenched α 1 specimens may be ordered but as temperature is increased the long-range order is broken down, producing small domains each highly ordered. At about 25 atomic % cadmium the structure is face- centred cubic. A new phase α' is proposed at this composition. A tentative diagram of the Au 3 Cd region, linking the four phases α, α 1, α' and α 2 is suggested with peritectoid horizontals at 412 °C and 407 °C. Factors affecting the behaviour of the liquidus and solidus of the gold-cadmium system are revealed by comparing with other systems of copper, silver and gold. The comparisons show the influence of the electron concentration, modified by lattice distortions and the electrochemical factor. The α 2 -phase (close-packed hexagonal) is shown to contain numerous stacking faults; this may be a consequence of the α(face-centred cubic) and α 2 -phases having nearly equal free energies. The occurrence of the 3 / 2 electron compounds in gold is discussed and suggestions are given for their bearing on maximum solid solubilities in gold. </p...|$|R
40|$|During flash sintering, ceramic {{materials}} can sinter to high density {{in a matter}} of seconds while subjected to electric field and elevated temperature. This process, which occurs at lower furnace temperatures and in shorter times than both conventional ceramic sintering and field-assisted methods such as spark plasma sintering, has the potential to radically reduce the power consumption required for the densification of {{ceramic materials}}. This paper reviews the experimental work on flash sintering methods carried out to date, and compares the properties of the materials obtained to those produced by conventional sintering. The flash sintering process is described for oxides of zirconium, yttrium, aluminium, tin, zinc, and titanium; silicon and boron carbide, zirconium diboride, materials for solid oxide fuel applications, ferroelectric materials, and composite materials. While experimental observations have been made on a wide range of materials, understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the onset and latter stages of flash sintering is still elusive. Elements of the proposed theories to explain the observed behaviour include extensive Joule heating throughout the material causing <b>thermal</b> runaway, <b>arrested</b> by the current limitation in the power supply, and the formation of defect avalanches which rapidly and dramatically increase the sample conductivity. Undoubtedly, the flash sintering process is affected by the electric field strength, furnace temperature and current density limit, but also by microstructural features such as the presence of second phase particles or dopants and the particle size in the starting material. While further experimental work and modelling is still required to attain a full understanding capable of predicting the success of the flash sintering process in different materials, the technique non-etheless holds great potential for exceptional control of the ceramic sintering process...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} abdominal {{compartment syndrome}} (ACS) {{is defined as}} the presence of organ dysfunction with concurrent intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in a scenario lacking primary intraperitoneal injury or intervention. This state appears to be related to visceral, abdominal wall and retroperitoneal edema and ascites induced by resuscitation. Despite a diverse range of associated causes such as pancreatitis, intra-abdominal sepsis, cardiac <b>arrest,</b> <b>thermal</b> injury and extraperitoneal trauma, this class of ACS is characterized by the presence of shock requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation. Secondary ACS is an extreme condition along a continuum of raised intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) that is pathoneumonic when associated with new overt organ failure. When IAP is above normal but is not associated with organ failure, IAH is diagnosed. Because these conditions are common among critically ill patients, the measurement of IAP is crucial. It is unclear whether preventing IAH reduces progression to ACS or influences outcomes. When overt ACS is confirmed, immediate surgical decompression of the patient's abdomen via a standard laparotomy is usually required. Because many disease processes resulting in critical illness require aggressive fluid resuscitation as a primary therapy, it is likely that secondary ACS is much more common than previously believed. Further study is needed...|$|R
40|$|Yeast cells {{subjected}} to a reversible <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> of meiosis yielded progressively fewer spores per ascus as the arrest was extended. Dissection of two-spored asci by a newly developed method that prevents selection of false asci revealed that the spores were not {{a random sample of}} the haploid meiotic products. Most, if not all, pairs of spores contain nonsister products of the reductional division. Electron microscopic examination of the meiotic cells revealed the cytological basis for this bias. All four spindle pole bodies (SPBs) present at the second meiotic division normally gain a structural modification (the outer plaque) upon which the initiation of the prospore wall occurs. In the formation of a two-spored ascus, only one spindle pole body on each meiosis II spindle was so modified. These observations suggest that the morphogenesis of spores is regulated at meiosis II by limiting the number of SPBs gaining the outer plaque. The enhancement of spore yield upon addition of fresh medium suggests that this morphogenetic regulation responds more directly to nutrient deprivation arising during the <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest,</b> rather than to elevated temperature per se...|$|E

40|$|High-angle grain {{boundaries}} in steel offer an important {{resistance to the}} propagation of cleavage cracks that affects the fracture toughness and can modulate the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of fracture downward. This behavior has been studied in this thesis in detail. In grain-boundary toughness measurement experiments in bicrystals of Fe- 3 %Si alloy, specific measurements of the fracture resistance of a random selection of high angle {{grain boundaries}} and associated fractographic studies have led to quantitative models of the resistance that high-angle grain boundaries offer to cleavage cracks. The study has also revealed a transition from pure cleavage to mixed cleavage (PC/MC) around OC for this alloy. Experiments were also carried out on the modes of advance of cleavage cracks through a field of randomly oriented grains at - 30 C in the pure cleavage range (lower shelf) in very large grain-sized Fe- 2 %Si alloy, permitting detailed observations of the chronology of percolation of the cleavage crack front. Utilizing previously developed model-based information on the peak resistance to fracture of high angle grain boundaries, with a given tilt and twist misorientation across them, and detailed measurements of orientations of individual grains in the samples, {{it was possible to}} develop percolation maps of cleavage through the field of grains that for the initial phases of fracture through grains predicted the actual path with about 70 % accuracy when compared with experimental observations.

On the basis of these experiments and modeling a simple expression is projected for the effect of grain boundaries on the overall cleavage fracture resistance of low-carbon steel in the lower shelf region.

40|$|Inactivation of Mec 1, {{the budding}} yeast ATR, {{results in a}} {{permanent}} S phase arrest followed by chromosome breakage and cell death during G 2 /M. The S phase arrest is proposed to stem from a defect in Mec 1 -mediated degradation of Sml 1, a conserved inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), causing a severe depletion in cellular dNTP pools. Here, the casual link between the S phase arrest, Sml 1, and dNTP-levels is examined using a temperature sensitive mec 1 mutant. In addition to S phase <b>arrest,</b> <b>thermal</b> inactivation of Mec 1 leads to constitutively high levels of Sml 1 and an S phase arrest. Expression of a novel suppressor, GIS 2, a conserved mRNA binding zinc finger protein, rescues the arrest without down-regulating Sml 1 levels. The dNTP pool in mec 1 is reduced by ∼ 17 % and GIS 2 expression restores it, but only partially, to ∼ 93 % of a control. We infer that the permanent S phase block following Mec 1 inactivation can be uncoupled from its role in Sml 1 down-regulation. Furthermore, unexpectedly modest effects of mec 1 and GIS 2 on dNTP levels suggest that the S phase arrest is unlikely to result from a severe depletion of dNTP pool as assumed, but a heightened sensitivity to small changes in its availability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the behaviour of artificial magnetic square spin ice patterns {{in response to}} applied magnetic fields and thermal activation. Two main points of focus are the access of well-defined statistical states and the properties of fractionalised “monopole” charge defects. Experimental investigations are conducted using magnetic force microscopy of athermal remanent states. Magnetic reversal of a square ice subject to magnetic fields applied slightly off a diagonal symmetry axis is found to mediate via incremental sublattice-independent processes. Dipolar correlations manifest as charge defect propagation and ordering, along and between adjacent flipped moment chains respectively. Quenched disorder, while allowing for bulk defect nucleation, is responsible for strongly suppressing correlations. A constant magnitude rotating field protocol is investigated. The acquisition of strong ground state ordering via highly correlated edgenucleated reversal processes, as recently predicted, is not found, attributable to the enhancement of bulk processes by quenched disorder. An optimally tuned field allows for efficient demagnetisation towards the ground state. A study of as-fabricated states is presented, magnetically self-ordered following formation of magnetic elements via evaporative vacuum deposition. Compelling evidence is presented, in {{a case study of}} a sample closely approaching the ground state, for superparamagnetism during early deposition stages which is subsequently arrested. Large ground state domains are observed sustaining Boltzmann factor weighted monopole excitations. Evidence is present for monopole interactions playing a role in thermal ordering, as excitations explore a dipolar energy band structure. Further, order is found to increase with interaction strength, and preliminary results suggest that quenched disorder acts to suppress it. Statistical mechanical calculations show that states achieved correspond closely to <b>arrested</b> <b>thermal</b> equilibrium. Consideration of an effective thermodynamic model presented for ac field demagnetised states is given. Comparison allows for discussion of the general role of quenched disorder and the effective temperature of a “frozen” state. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Co-continuous {{structures}} {{generated from}} the phase separation of polymer blends present many opportunities for practical application. Due to the large interfacial area in such structures and the incompatibility between the components, such non-equilibrium structures tend to coarsen spontaneously into larger sizes and eventually form dispersed morphologies. Here, we utilize various strategies to kinetically stabilize the co-continuous structures in polymer blend systems at nano- to micro- size scales. ^ In the partially miscible blend of polystyrene and poly(vinyl methyl ether), we {{took advantage of the}} spinodal decomposition (SD) process upon <b>thermal</b> quenching, and <b>arrested</b> the co-continuous micro-structures by the addition of nanoparticles. In this approach, the critical factor for structural stabilization is that the nanoparticles are preferentially segregated into one phase of a polymer mixture undergoing SD and form a percolated network (colloidal gel) beyond a critical loading of nanoparticles. Once formed, this network prevents further structural coarsening and thus arrests the co-continuous structure with a characteristic length scale of several microns. Our findings indicate that a key to arresting the co-continuous blend morphology at modest volume fractions of preferentially-wetted particles is to have attractive, rather than repulsive, interactions between particles. ^ For the immiscible blend of polystyrene and poly(2 -vinyl pyridine) (PS/P 2 VP), we presented a strategy to compatibilize the blend by using random copolymers of styrene and 2 -vinylpyridine, controlling the degree of immiscibility between PS and P 2 VP. Based on such compatibilization, co-continuous structured membranes, having characteristic size down to tens of nanometers, were fabricated in a facile way, via the solvent-induced macrophase separation of polymer blend thin films. The feature size was controlled by controlling the film thickness and varying the molecular weight of the PS homopolymer and the random copolymers. As the processing method (solution casting) is simple and the structures are insensitive to the solvent or substrate choices, this approach shows great potential in the large scale fabrication of co-continuous nanoscopic templates on flexible substrates via roll-to-roll processes. ^ Moreover, we proposed a quasi-binary blend system based on the PS/P 2 VP pair {{with the addition of a}} common solvent. An experimentally accessible phase mixing temperature was achieved, and the co-continuous morphologies were generated via thermally induced spinodal decomposition. The addition of solid particles significantly slowed down the coarsening kinetics and, in some cases, arrested the co-continuous structures at ∼ 6 µm for a short period of time. This study suggests an alternative means to achieve co-continuous structures in polymer solutions and also provides better understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of polymer blend phase separation. ^ Our research demonstrates several means of kinetically trapping the non-equilibrium interconnected structures at sub-micron to tens-of-nanometer size scales that are germane to several functions including active layers of photovoltaic cells and polymer-based membranes. ...|$|R

Sustainable energy production and its utilization are among the many challenges that humankind is facing today. In 2016 and 2017, the expected global production of hydrocarbon based automotive vehicles is expected to be 97. 8 and 101. 8 million respectively, and is expected to rise. The collective thermal energy losses from radiators and exhausts from these automotive vehicles are enormous. This is a big bottleneck in sustainable energy production and utilization. In mitigating this hurdle, TE materials will play a very important role. However, TE {{materials have}} low efficiency in thermal to electrical energy conversion owing to the reciprocal relation between the thermal and the electrical transport properties. Recent advances in nanotechnology tools have given a new dimension to decouple this relation. Back in 2003, our group reported a very promising TE material, NiyMo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 (y < 0. 1). Improving the figure-of-merit of Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 (“bulk”) material through nanocomposite synthesis is {{one of the goals of}} my research. The main outcome of nanocomposite synthesis is the reduced <b>thermal</b> conductivity through <b>arresting</b> the coherent propagation of heat carrying acoustic waves in TE materials. To this end, I synthesized and characterized the transport properties of various nanocomposites. I have used fullerenes, oxides, carbides, and metal particles to fabricate nanocomposites. Chapter 3 addresses the effect of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) when added to Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6. We characterized these samples for their TE properties, and addressed the effect of porosity on transport properties. The effect of ball-milling on MWCNT was studied. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the microstructural and nanostructural features of the samples. In a sample with 3 mass-% of MWCNT, the main contributing factor in elevating the figure-of-merit by 25 % was the reduction in the thermal conductivity by 40 %. In Chapter 4, we reported the results of Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 /SiC and Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 /Al 2 O 3 composites consolidated through hot-pressing and spark-plasma sintering respectively. Samples with different volume fractions of SiC were prepared and characterized. Thermoelectric transport properties of these composites were characterized from 325 K to 740 K. For the sample with 0. 01 volume fraction of SiC, there was an enhancement in the figure-of-merit by an 18 % compared to the reference sample, mainly due to an 18 % reduction in the thermal conductivity. Microstructural information obtained through SEM, TEM, and BET was used to elucidate phase and transport properties. Spark-plasma sintered bulk sample has exhibited the highest figure-of-merit, which is 35 % higher than the bulk consolidated through hot-pressing. Pore effect on thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity were investigated. In Chapter 5, we covered various properties of bulk/NiSb composite. In this study, requisite amounts of bulk Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 thermoelectric (TE) material and NiSb nanoparticles of ~ 60 nm were synthesized through solid-state reactions and solvothermal routes, respectively. NiSb nanoparticles were then manually mixed with Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 in volume fractions of 0, 0. 034, 0. 074, and 0. 16. All samples were consolidated by hot-pressing, and then their TE properties were characterized. The addition of NiSb nanoparticles elevated both the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, but reduced the Seebeck coefficient. TEM images show highly electrically and thermally conductive NiSb nanoparticles settled within interstitial voids between bulk particles, thus, forming bridges between the balk particles. These networks of NiSb particles facilitate the electrical and thermal conductivity. Variation in lattice thermal conductivity from 330 K to 755 K for all samples shows that phonons are undergoing the same scattering mechanism. By adopting Callaway formalism for the lattice thermal conductivity, we made attempts to delineate the contribution of various scattering mechanism to the enhanced lattice thermal conductivity in bulk/NiSb composites. We concluded that electron-phonon scattering, which is the main factor for the increased lattice thermal conductivity in Mo 3 Sb 7 -xTex (0. 0 < x ≤ 1. 8) series was not the reason in our case, but rather that an overlap in the DOS of phonons of bulk and NiSb particles, was primarily responsible for the high phonon-phonon transfer efficiency from bulk to NiSb particles and vice versa. We also speculated that there was a reduction in the umklapp process. Contribution from boundaries and interfaces was less in scattering phonons. Increase in hardness with respect to NiSb content provided an indication of increased Debye temperature of composites. Irrespective of extensive interfaces created by NiSb nanoparticles, there was no reduction in the thermal conductivity. Contrary to this, electrical conductivity of the bulk, 0. 034, and 0. 074 samples showed the same temperature dependence, whereas the 0. 16 sample did not, revealing that the charge carrier scattering for the 0. 16 sample was different from the rest. The existence of the electrical percolation phenomena was analyzed in detail and compared with other composites. SEM images of composites show that NiSb nanoparticles distributed homogeneously in 0. 16 composite. HRTEM images of 0. 16 composite shows crystalline nature of bulk and NiSb particles; we also used this information to interpret the enhanced lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, larger NiSb particles of 100 m  00 m size were synthesized through solid-state reaction and consolidated by hot-pressing. Their TE properties were characterized as well, in order to use these parameters to interpret the transport properties of the nanocomposites. Finally, there was a systematic improvement in the hardness of the composites with increasing NiSb content. In Chapter 6, we extensively investigated the effective thermal properties and thermal boundary resistance of Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 /SiC and Ni 0. 05 Mo 3 Sb 5. 4 Te 1. 6 /Al 2 O 3 composites at 325 K. Different effective media approximations (EMA) models were utilized to predict thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance). The salient feature of this study is the comparison of these two composites based on their microstructure. This study shows that it is important to give credence to microstructures while addressing the effective thermal properties. Bounds for the effective thermal conductivity were determined using the Lipton–Vernescu model. The effect of SiC and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles on mechanical properties were analyzed and interpreted. Thermal properties in relation to mechanical properties were discussed. In Chapter 7, we engineered the grain boundaries of bulk particles through a process called nanocoating. NiSb nanoparticles of 60 nm – 80 nm were coated on the bulk particles through the solvothermal process. The actual process of solvothermal coating did not affect the bulk material. Layers of 300 nm – 500 nm NiSb nanoparticles were observed on the bulk sample with the 0. 16 vol% NiSb nanoparticles. In Chapter 8, we covered the effect of addition of C 60 on the TE properties of bulk material. C 60 was added in 1, 2, and, 3 mass%, respectively. Each part was hot-pressed at 150 MPa and 923 K. The sample with 1 % C 60 was characterized via a Rietveld refinement and TEM analysis. Measurements of the three thermoelectric key properties revealed that the Seebeck coefficient barely depends on the carbon amount added, while both the electrical and the thermal conductivity decrease with increasing amount of carbon. Depending on the amount of C 60 used and on the temperature, the thermoelectric performance was either enhanced or decreased, depending on whether the electrical conductivity decreased less or more than the thermal conductivity. At the highest temperature measured, all carbon-containing samples performed better than the unmodified bulk sample, namely up to 14 %. These improvements are within the error margin, however...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} {{phase diagram}} of the UO 2 – ThO 2 system has been experimentally revisited {{in the present study}} {{for the first time since}} 1970, using a laser heating approach combined with fast pyrometry in a <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> method. The melting / solidification temperature, which is of fundamental information for a reactor design was studied here. It was found that low addition of ThO 2 to UO 2 would result in a slight decrease of the solidification temperature. A minimum was found at 3098 K around a composition of 5 mol % ThO 2. The solid / liquid transition temperature was then observed to increase again with increasing ThO 2 fraction. The literature value of pure ThO 2 (around 3630 K) was well reproduced here. Important experimental difficulties, stemming from the high temperatures reached during the measurements, as well as a completeinvestigation with electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction are extensively discussed. These results show the importance of the high-temperature oxygen chemistry also in this actinide oxide compound. JRC. E. 3 -Materials researc...|$|E

In this context, the high temperature behaviour of uranium nitride and mixed uranium–plutonium nitrides has been studied in the present work by laser heating under controlled atmosphere coupled with fast multi-wavelength pyrometry. Such an approach has allowed performing a <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> analysis and establishing the solid–liquid phase boundaries in the investigated compositions, whereby non-congruent vaporisation was avoided by setting a suitable nitrogen overpressure. In addition, the normal spectral emissivities of the current samples were determined by radiance spectroscopy. Besides revealing a slightly more metallic optical behaviour in plutonium-containing compositions, this latter characterisation led to the determination of the real melting/solidification temperatures of the investigated nitrides. It is confirmed that UN melts congruently at (3120 ± 30) K in a nitrogen pressure of 0. 25 MPa (2. 5 bar). The melting/solidification temperatures decrease in plutonium containing samples, reaching (3045 ± 25) K for x(PuN) = 0. 2, a composition of interest for potential applications of this material as a nuclear fuel. Besides their fundamental importance, the current results are useful for {{a deeper understanding of the}} nitride fuel behaviour under accidental conditions, whereby uncontrolled thermal excursions might occur in the nuclear reactor core.

The magnetic susceptibility for the compounds EuTi_ 2 Al_ 20 and GdTi_ 2 Al_ 20 showed a sudden jump below the Néel temperature T_N indicative of plausible double magnetic transition. Specific heat (C_P) and electrical resistivity (ρ) measurements also confirm the first-order magnetic transition (FOMT) and possible double magnetic transitions. Temperature variation of heat capacity showed a sharp phase transition and huge C_P value for the (Eu/Gd) Ti_ 2 Al_ 20 compounds Full width at half-maximum (FWHM) < 0. 2 K) which is reminiscent of a first-order phase transition and a unique attribute among RTM_ 2 Al_ 20 compounds. We observed clear anomaly between heating and cooling cycle in temperature-time relaxation curve for the compounds GdTi_ 2 Al_ 20 (2. 38 K) and EuTi_ 2 Al_ 20 (3. 2 K) which is indicating a <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> due to the latent heat. The temperature variation of S_mag for GdTi_ 2 Al_ 20 saturates to a value 0. 95 R 8 while the other magnetic systems exhibited still lower entropy saturation values in the high temperature limit.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, dilute alloys in the Mg-rich {{corner of the}} Mg-Ce-In ternary system in the {{composition}} range 0 to 3 % In and 0 to 1. 5 % Ce were synthesized. Cooling curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the liquidus points in order to construct the liquidus surface of the ternary phase diagram in the Mg corner. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to examine phases present at the compositions studied. A <b>thermal</b> <b>arrest</b> presumed to represent a eutectic transformation was discovered at 580 °C. Two new intermetallic compounds, designated tau and theta, were found. Trace silicon present in the alloys was found to concentrate in one of the intermetallic compounds. To further investigate these compounds, an induction furnace was used to synthesize alloys containing the concentrations of Ce and In seen in electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) examinations of these compounds. The alloys were examined using the cooling curve technique and XRD, and proved to contain the compounds already observed with some variation in dissolved indium content. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to confirm the liquidus and solidus values determined using cooling curve analysis. A diffusion couple with terminal compositions of pure Ce and a Mg-In alloy was prepared {{in order to determine the}} equilibrium phases present in the system between these two compositions at 390 °C. EPMA was used to identify the zones obtained, and confirmed the presence of several Mg-Ce compounds with 1 at% dissolved indium, as well as a ternary compound corresponding to the theta compound found in the dilute alloys. Finally, literature values and experimental data were used to calculate a preliminary ternary phase diagram using FACTSage, in collaboration with the CTRC at Ecole Polytechnique, in order to affirm the validity of the experimentally determined values as well as to project the diagram beyond the studied composition range...|$|E
