5|$|Seeking information, Ken points Tommy towards Juan Garcia Cortez (Robert Davi), {{who helped}} set the {{exchange}} up. Expressing regret for the matter, Cortez promises to help Tommy {{find out who}} masterminded <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> plot. In the process of finding leads, Tommy meets Kent Paul (Danny Dyer), who leads Tommy {{to one of the}} participants in <b>the</b> <b>ambush.</b> Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz (Luis Guzmán), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised <b>the</b> <b>ambush.</b> With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in <b>the</b> <b>ambush,</b> Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and distance himself from the Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{themselves}} {{along the}} Mersing–Jemaluang road, 'D' Company was deployed {{to the north}} {{on the western side}} of the road as the lookout force, while 'B' Company was positioned further to the south {{on the opposite side of}} the road. South of them, 'A' Company formed the blocking force, with their position stretched across the road oriented to the north. Behind them, 'C' Company was positioned in reserve, further south. The plan had been for <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> to be sprung during the day, but the Japanese advance had proceeded more slowly than thought, and it was not until after dark that they entered <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> site. In order to inflict as many casualties as possible, the Japanese force, which was estimated to be battalion-sized, was allowed to pass through 'D' and 'B' Companies. By 3:00am they came up against 'A' Company's blocking position and <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> was finally initiated. Devastating indirect fire from artillery and mortars inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese; however, as the northernmost company—'D'—turned south to attack the Japanese from the rear, they came up against determined resistance from a force of Japanese that had managed to infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> site and dig in on a small feature to the east of the estate's pig farm, north of 'B' Company. This effectively cut them off from the rest of the battalion.|$|E

5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. Western diplomats suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for <b>the</b> <b>ambush,</b> though the KLA denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, the KLA abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in <b>the</b> <b>ambush.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ambush {{marketing}} {{is becoming a}} more and more relevant topic. However, most research has remained descriptive. No study has yet considered the image effects of ambush marketing using a causal model. Thus, the present paper provides a causal model of ambush marketing focusing on cognitive and affective image and their effects on downstream variables such as attitudes and purchase intention. The results of an online-survey with 278 respondents show that for typical sports brands affective image has a stronger impact on attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>ambusher</b> brand. In contrast, for atypical sport brands cognitive image has a stronger impact on the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>ambusher.</b> Further, a strong impact of attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>ambusher</b> brand on purchase intention has been identified...|$|R

5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled an arms {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of <b>the</b> <b>ambush.</b> They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> <b>ambush</b> resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E

5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to <b>the</b> <b>ambush,</b> U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E

5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as <b>the</b> <b>ambush</b> site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
5|$|Having {{restored}} his surviving {{forces to}} order, and {{aware of the}} confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter-attack. The plan he laid out made far greater use of the particular skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in ambush. The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign retreat and draw them into <b>the</b> <b>ambush.</b>|$|E

The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "kill zone" [...] {{is used in}} paintball {{tactics to}} {{designate}} {{an area that is}} heavily defended by enemy paintball players. Advancing players may know the location of the potential kill zone but be uncertain whether it is well-defended. Responses vary to being caught in a paintball kill zone. If the kill zone is too large and the enemy forces relatively far away, <b>the</b> <b>ambushed</b> players often retreat to cover. If the kill zone is small, <b>the</b> <b>ambushed</b> players are likely to charge forward and assault the defensive players. Fellow players who are not caught in the kill zone are likely to attack the flanks of the defensive players.|$|R
