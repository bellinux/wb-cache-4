5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} starve it into submission.

5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were <b>then</b> <b>also</b> allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas. This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Anachronism {{is a major}} {{component}} of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna. <b>Then</b> <b>also</b> the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, <b>then</b> <b>also</b> settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

The letters of her last name <b>then</b> <b>also</b> appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names.

5|$|Hampden {{hosted the}} 1960 European Cup Final; Real Madrid {{defeated}} 7–3 Eintracht Frankfurt with 130,000 people in attendance. Floodlights were installed at Hampden in 1961 and were inaugurated with a friendly match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers. The ground <b>then</b> <b>also</b> hosted the 1962 and 1966 finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup. The attendances {{for each of}} these finals was less than 50,000, and the SFA did not offer to host another European final until the 1976 European Cup Final, in which Bayern Munich defeated St Etienne. Until 1987, Hampden used square goalposts. St Etienne believed that two of their efforts which hit the square crossbar and rebounded into play would have resulted in goals if it had been round.|$|E

The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (<b>then</b> <b>also</b> called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E

5|$|Joyce and Nora {{went into}} self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later came to {{fact that the}} agent had been swindled; the {{director}} of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, <b>then</b> <b>also</b> part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who <b>then</b> <b>also</b> fled.|$|E
