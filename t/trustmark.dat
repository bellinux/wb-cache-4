Internet firms have begun posting third-party certifications, labelled “trustmarks”, as signals of reliability, credibility, and general trustworthiness.

It identifies and categorises sets of internet signals, highlighting the critical role of <b>trustmarks</b> in the computer-mediated environment.

40|$|Abstract: The POWDER {{protocol}} is a Semantic Web {{technology that}} {{takes advantage of}} natural groupings of URIs in order to annotate all the resources in a regular expressiondelineated sub-space of the URI space. POWDER is a mechanism for accreditation, <b>trustmarking,</b> and resource discovery, emphasising the publishing of attributed metadata by third parties and trusted authorities. Demonstrating its versatility, {{it has also been}} deployed in unforeseen use cases, such as repository compression. In this paper we present the POWDER protocol, explain its position in the Semantic Web architecture, expose and discuss current implementations and use cases, and future directions...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} facing the full {{deployment}} of business-to-consumer (B 2 C) e-commerce {{is the development}} of trust {{on the side of the}} consumer. People develop trust in a business through their own previous experience with that business or through reports about that business from trusted third parties or other consumers. While a great deal of effort has been spent on privacy and secure transactions, resulting in seals of approvals and <b>trustmarks,</b> little has been done in the way of developing systems that will assure the consumer that the e-commerce site with which they are dealing is “legitimate ” in such things as delivery, return policies, etc. A problem with seals and <b>trustmarks</b> is that they are an “all-or-nothing ” approach and give a single value (the seal). A more flexible system is required that rates e-commerce sites along multiple dimensions and allows the consumer to determine which dimension(s) is of importance at that moment in time. These rating should be done by trusted third parties and stored in Label Bureaus. A prototype architecture has been developed that supports distributed Label Bureaus and multiple rating systems that rate along multiple dimensions. The architecture is based on a Label Engine and an Application Server that retrieves labels from one or more Label Bureaus and applies a rating algorithm to merge the various rating systems. An architecture that supports third party labeling allows the consumer to develop a rational trust level in unknown businesses. 1...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the health}} {{information}} available to consumers on the Internet is incomplete, out of date, and even inaccurate. Seals of approval or <b>trustmarks</b> have been suggested as a strategy to assist consumers to identify high quality information. Little is known, however, about how consumers interpret such seals. This study addresses this issue by examining assumptions about the quality criteria that are reflected by a seal of approval. This question is of particular importance because {{a wide variety of}} quality criteria have been suggested for online health information, including core aspects of quality such as accuracy, currency, and completeness, proxy indicators of quality such as the disclosure of commercial interests, and indicators that reflect the quality of the site or the interaction it affords, such as the availability of a search mechanism. The {{results of this study suggest}} that seals of approval are assumed to certify information quality primarily with respect to core quality indicators, aspects that subjects both consider to be important and feel relatively less able to evaluate for themselves (compared to their ability to rate proxy indicators of information or indicators of site or interaction quality). This assumption is largely inconsistent with practice: most seals of approval involve assessment of proxy indicators of information quality, rather than direct assessment of content. These results identify a problem that certification or accreditation bodies must address, since unless and until consumer expectations are congruent with evaluation practice, seals of approval seem to promise more than they deliver...|$|R
40|$|Background Internet sites {{typically}} contain visual design {{elements that}} are unrelated {{to the quality of}} the health information presented but that could influence credibility judgments and responses to health advice. To assess the effects of such design elements, or credibility cues, experimentally, we exposed women with different levels of weekly alcohol consumption to a website containing high quality but unpalatable information about a related health risk (breast cancer). The information was presented alongside either positive or negative credibility cues unrelated to information content. Objectives We explored four research questions: (1) Did the cues influence how the women engaged with the site? (2) Did they influence how the women responded cognitively and emotionally? (3) Did they influence whether the women subsequently acted on the advice? (4) Did the impact of the cues vary with how much alcohol the women reported drinking? Method: A total of 85 women were randomly assigned to view one of two versions of a website containing the same high-quality content but different cues. One version had positive credibility cues (<b>trustmarks),</b> the other had negative ones (adverts, pharmaceutical sponsorship, and a donation button). Objective measures included visual attention (using eye-tracking equipment), time studying the material, and recall. Subjective measures included cognitive and affective responses and intention to change. Measures of subsequent behavior were taken 1 week later. Results First, the cues did not affect how long the women spent on the site or how long they spent reading the text. However, women in the negative cues condition spent more time looking at a donation button than those in the positive cues condition spent looking at a TRUSTe seal (β = −. 43, P <. 001) but less time looking at a logo (β =. 43, P <. 001) or at certain other features of the site. Those in the negative cues condition also recalled more site content (β = −. 22, P =. 048). Second, there were no effects of the cues on any of the measures of cognition, affect, vulnerability, or intentions. However, third, at follow-up, the positive cues had promoted greater alcohol reduction than the negative cues among those women who had previously reported drinking more heavily (β = −. 22, P =. 02). So, fourth, the responses to the cues did vary with how much alcohol the women typically drank. Conclusions Content-irrelevant images and logos can influence the behavioral response to quality health-risk information. These effects may be subtle, changing with time...|$|R
