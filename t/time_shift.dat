5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with <b>Time</b> <b>Shift</b> stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable <b>Time</b> <b>Shift</b> stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

Inversion of seismic data for pressure changes requires {{better understanding of the}} dependence of compaction-induced <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> on reservoir pressure reduction. Here, we in-vestigate pressure-dependent behavior of P-, S-, and PS-wave <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> from reflectors located above and below a rectangular reservoir embedded in a homo-geneous half-space. Our geomechanical modeling algorithm generates the excess stress/strain field and the stress-induced stiffness tensor as linear functions of reservoir pressure. Analysis of <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> obtained from full-waveform synthetic data shows that they vary linearly with pressure for reflectors above the reser-voir, but become nonlinear for reflections from the reservoir or deeper interfaces. Time-shift misfit curves computed with respect to noise-contaminated data from a reference reservoir {{for a wide range of}} pressure reductions display well-defined minima. We also evaluate the influence of the reservoir width and third-order stiffness coefficients on <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> because these parameters will be fixed in the inversion for reservoir pressure. Our results indicate that stable pressure esti-mation requires including multicomponent <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> from reflectors below the reservoir and applying a nonlinear global inversion algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Since neutrinos {{could not}} be {{accurately}} tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average distribution in time of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4milliseconds, {{the time it takes}} to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, maximum likelihood, to search for the <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino arrival time, was approximately 60nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton pulse width was shortened to 3nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the generation time of each detected neutrino to that range.|$|E

6000|$|Is {{anything}} now displacing her? Well, {{there is the}} fact that railways are making land-carriage to-day more important relatively to water-carriage than at any previous period. That may, perhaps, in <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> the centre of the world from an island like England to the middle of a great land area, like Chicago or Moscow. And, no doubt, if ever the centre shifts at all, it will shift towards Western America, or rather the prairie region. But, just at present, what are the greatest commercial towns of the world? All ports to a man. And the day when it will be otherwise, if ever, seems still far distant. Look at the newest countries. What are their great focal points? Every one of them ports. Melbourne and Sydney; Rio, Buenos Ayres, and Valparaiso; Cape Town, San Francisco, Bombay, Calcutta, Yokohama. Chicago itself, the most vital and the quickest grower among modern towns, owes half its importance {{to the fact that there}} water-carriage down the Great Lakes begins; though it owes the other half, I admit, to the converse fact that all the great trans-continental railways have to bend south at that point to avoid Lake Michigan. Still, on the whole, I think, as long as conditions remain what they are, the commercial supremacy of England is in no immediate danger.
