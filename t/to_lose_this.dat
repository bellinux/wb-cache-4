5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election they are likely <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> <b>This</b> typically happens {{where there has been}} a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the January 30, 2012 {{episode of}} Raw to evaluate Laurinaitis' performance as general manager. Before he could announce the decision, he {{was interrupted by}} the returning Undertaker. After initially refusing the rematch as {{he did not want}} to tarnish The Undertaker's legacy, Triple H accepted the challenge after being called a coward who lives in Shawn Michaels' shadow, on the condition their rematch be contested inside Hell in a Cell. Triple H went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> match at WrestleMania XXVIII.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{commitments}} left MacLaren {{unavailable for}} the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> <b>This</b> was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.|$|E

25|$|Australia's {{financial}} and mining booms during 1969 and 1970 resulted in {{establishment of the}} headquarters of many major companies (BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, among others) in the city. Nauru's then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in Melbourne, such as Nauru House. Melbourne remained Australia's main business and financial centre until the late 1970s, when it began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> primacy to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|There were {{setbacks}} in {{the growth}} of the university. In 1967, the Rutgers Physics Department had a Centers of Excellence Grant from the NSF which allowed the Physics Department to hire several faculty each year and become a more prominent institution. These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the Associate or Full Professor designation would become tenured. The Governor and the Chancellor forced Rutgers <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> grant by rejecting these faculty as tenured.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos {{contrived}} <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> one, having {{first had}} Leicestershire Foxes {{on the rack}} after limiting them {{to a total of}} 150 for 9. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made that possible, but he was later to be the main culprit as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets and refused to give him runs. He eventually finished on 18 from 17 balls, making the task of Gareth Breese and Gordon Muchall impossible - and Durham finished an agonising three runs short.|$|E

25|$|The same {{mountains}} that provide Chattanooga's scenic backdrop also served to trap industrial pollutants which {{caused them to}} settle over the community, so much that in 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga had the dirtiest air in the nation. But environmental crises {{were not the only}} problems plaguing the city. Like other early industrial cities, Chattanooga entered the 1980s with serious socioeconomic challenges, including job layoffs due to de-industrialization, deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions, and social division. Chattanooga's population declined by more than 10% in the 1980s. However, Chattanooga was the only major U.S. city <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> proportion of its population in the 1980s and then regain the same proportion in the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Reformation in Zürich and its rapid {{territorial}} expansion definitely made this religious renewal a political issue and {{a major source of}} conflict between the thirteen cantons. The alpine cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, and Zug remained staunchly Catholic. Their opposition was not uniquely a question of faith; economic reasons also played a role. Besides on agriculture, their economy depended to a large degree on the mercenary services and the financial recompensations for the same. They could not afford <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> source of income, which was a major target of reformatory criticism. In contrast, the cities' economies were more diversified, including strong crafts and guilds as well as a budding industrial sector. Fribourg and Solothurn also remained Catholic.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly.

I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet.

50|$|The closest the Conservatives {{have ever}} come <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>this</b> seat {{was at a}} {{by-election}} in November 1997, {{at the height of}} Tony Blair's 'honeymoon period' as Prime Minister, following the resignation of the previous MP Piers Merchant in a sex scandal.

50|$|The biggest {{success in}} the club's history is {{reaching}} placement to 2nd Yugoslavia League on 9 October 1977, after achieving a victory against Partizan Jagodina 98-97.

25|$|His career best {{score was}} 143, made against Leicestershire at Chesterfield in 1924, the highest {{score of the}} season for Derbyshire, who failed to win a match all season and {{contrived}} <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> one after being ahead by 52 on first innings by being bowled out for 69 in the second innings. This remained his only hundred until 1927, when he scored two more, 110 against Glamorgan at Chesterfield and 102 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, and enjoyed his best season in terms of averages, with 871 runs at 27.21. There was a fourth century in 1928, 111 against Warwickshire at Derby, and a final one the following season, 138 against Somerset at Burton-on-Trent, when he put on 153 for the seventh wicket with Archibald Slater and 113 for the eighth wicket with Arthur Richardson. In 1930, he played pretty regularly, but by this time batted mostly at No 7 or 8 and in the season he scored less than 500 runs. The following year, he played just nine matches and was not re-engaged {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
500|$|Another memorable {{race that}} year for Prost {{was at the}} San Marino Grand Prix. He was {{cruising}} to victory when his car began {{to run out of}} fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself [...] "shit, I am going <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> race again", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.|$|E
500|$|Cobaltocene, Co(C5H5)2, is a metallocene, the cobalt {{analogue}} of ferrocene. It {{is a dark}} purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, {{one more}} than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, {{in accordance with the}} 18-electron rule. This additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(C5H5)2 are characterized by its tendency <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> [...] "extra" [...] electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate. Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent, and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups. Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene, an even stronger reducing agent. Iridocene (involving iridium) would presumably be still more potent, but is not very well-studied due to its instability.H5)2Rh und (C5H5)2Ir |journal= J. Organomet.

Phyllis Nagy's screenplay emphasises their steeliness and self-reliance. In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions {{in a society that}} refuses to acknowledge 'difference' of any sort." [...] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon wrote: [...] "From its opening shots of the autumnal, rain-swept streets of New York sometime {{in the middle of the}} last century, director Todd Haynes’ magnificent new film [...] "Carol" [...] establishes a mood of mournful romance, half nostalgic and half ominous, that never lets go." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said: [...] "Everything clicks into place for this gorgeous achievement. Cinematographer Ed Lachman shot on Super 16 mm film to achieve era-specific muted colours and softer textures. Precise production design and a palette steeped in shades of green and red (appropriate to the Yuletide setting) make watching it seem like stepping inside an Edward Hopper painting." [...] Mark Kermode wrote in The Guardian: [...] "This superb adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel The Price of Salt doesn't put a foot wrong. From Phyllis Nagy's alluringly uncluttered script to Cate Blanchett's sturdily tremulous performance as a society woman with everything <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>this</b> brilliantly captures the thrills, tears and fears of forbidden love." ...|$|E
