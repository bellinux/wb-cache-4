Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead.

25|$|A fast ball which pitches {{short but}} (due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the wicket surface) does not bounce high is very {{difficult}} to defend against, for the batsman will usually expect the ball to bounce high in this situation; this can often lead to the batsman being out bowled or lbw when they leave a ball which appeared to be rising over the stumps but stayed low. Such deliveries are not called long hops, due to the difficulty they cause the batsman.|$|E

25|$|Rigoletto {{was a great}} box-office {{success for}} La Fenice and Verdi's first major Italian triumph since the 1847 premiere of Macbeth in Florence. It {{initially}} had a run of 13 performances and was revived in Venice the following year, and again in 1854. Despite a rather disastrous production in Bergamo shortly after its initial run at La Fenice, the opera soon entered the repertory of Italian theatres. By 1852, it had premiered in all the major cities of Italy, although sometimes under different titles due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of censorship (e.g. as Viscardello, Lionello, and Clara de Perth). From 1852, it also began to be performed in major cities worldwide, reaching as far afield as Alexandria and Constantinople in 1854 and both Montevideo and Havana in 1855. The UK premiere took place on 14 May 1853 at {{what is now the}} Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London with Giovanni Matteo Mario as the Duke of Mantua and Giorgio Ronconi as Rigoletto. In the US, the opera was first seen on 19 February 1855 at New York's Academy of Music in a performance by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company.|$|E

500|$|Although the Japanese {{had been}} {{defeated}} in the Coral Sea, another attempt at capturing Port Moresby was anticipated. The Allied Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, decided to establish airbases to protect Port Moresby. To the west, he authorised {{the construction of an}} airbase at Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea. Another, codenamed [...] "Boston" [...] was authorised to the east in the largely unexplored Abau–Mullins Harbour area on 20 May. Any Japanese force approaching Port Moresby by sea would have to sail past these bases, allowing them to be detected and attacked earlier; but the base in the east had other advantages too. Bombers flying missions to Rabaul and other Japanese bases to the north from there would not have to overfly the Owen Stanley Range, and would not be subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the weather and air turbulence over the mountains. For that reason, an airstrip suitable for heavy bombers was desired so that they could stage there from Port Moresby and bases in northern Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a British built BN2B-26 Islander manufactured by Pilatus Britten-Norman in 1989, registration G-BOMG. It {{was a high}} wing design with two wing-mounted Lycoming O-540-E4C5 piston engines, each delivering a rated 260 horsepower to a two-blade variable-pitch propeller. It had fixed tricycle landing gear, with the two main gear bogies (two wheels each) mounted on legs that extend down from the wing, just aft of the engines. It made its first flight on March 20 of that year. It was delivered to the original customer in Germany, FLN Frisia Luftverkehr, on May 25, and re-registered in Germany as D-IBNF.

2500|$|What we {{are left}} with is an {{incomplete}} picture of de Hory, a complex but secretive man unable to shed his outlaw image, an adept role player, charismatic as many con-men tend to be, and whose notions of morality conformed to the exigencies (being a refugee, stateless, and subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of an artist’s life) he believed threatened his survival. De Hory expressed regret for his illicit career, taking advantage of others, though his rationalizations assuaged his sense of guilt, characterizing his criminality as an optionless necessity, survival by the only means he knew – his artistic skill. He famously asked, “Who would prefer a bad original to a good fake?” It is a question that goes beyond taking ownership of his law-breaking past. His underlying implication is a broader. Whenever authorship or authenticity of an artwork is in question, that reevaluation process forces us to reexamine how we define art, and by extension, our values as a society – an unintended result of their crimes that keeps us honest.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{examined}} {{the progress of}} the bill that became § 924(e) as it wound its way through Congress. Throughout the legislative process, Congress consistently focused on [...] "career offenders" [...] "those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood and who, because they possess weapons, present at least a potential threat of harm to persons." [...] Congress likewise singled out burglary because of the potential for harm that crime entails as compared to simple larceny or automobile crimes. Unlawful entry into a building always presents the danger of a confrontation, and if the intruder is likely to be armed, that confrontation becomes that much more dangerous. In earlier versions of the bill, Congress had specifically defined [...] "burglary," [...] thus suggesting that Congress had intended to take a [...] "categorical approach" [...] to defining burglary despite leaving the term undefined in {{the final version of the}} bill. Furthermore, the legislative history suggested that Congress intended that categorical approach to encompass a [...] "generic" [...] view of burglary, [...] "roughly corresponding to the definitions of burglary in a majority of the States' criminal codes." [...] In this way, Congress could avoid leaving the precise contours <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of varying definitions and labels crafted by other jurisdictions.|$|E
