5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} {{of drugs}} in the {{management}} of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others. Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about the risks and benefits associated with <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> management options. Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying person's life.|$|E
5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about <b>their</b> <b>pain.</b> In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|The way {{a person}} {{responds}} to pain affects {{the intensity of}} <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> (moderately), the degree of disability they experience, {{and the impact of}} pain on their quality of life. Strategies employed by people to cope with cancer pain include enlisting the help of others; persisting with tasks despite pain; distraction; rethinking maladaptive ideas; and prayer or ritual.|$|E

5|$|Regulations {{require that}} {{scientists}} use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering {{to be the}} central issue and see animal euthanasia {{as a way to}} reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused {{to have anything to}} do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> at these separations.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{returning}} to Paris, Betances became a key contact for the Cuban insurgency in Paris. He made several fund raising efforts, including one that attempted to fund quinine shipments to the Cuban rebels, to ease <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> when infected by malaria in the island battlefields. These efforts outlasted the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years' War in 1878. Betances also used his diplomatic contacts to guarantee humane treatment (and eventually freedom from imprisonment) to José Maceo, the brother of Antonio Maceo, the later military leader of the Cuban War of Independence, when both Antonio and José were arrested by the Spanish government in 1882. The Maceo brothers both escaped imprisonment, were recaptured in Gibraltar and {{turned over to the}} Spanish authorities, but José remained in jail long after Antonio regained his liberty and fled to New York City. Betances even used Lord Gladstone as a mediator, and attempted to convince him of having Jamaica (where his family had properties) join an Antillean Federation.|$|E

25|$|In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus tells a {{story about}} a man from Samaria who assists an injured man by, among other things, pouring oil and wine on his wounds. Oil mixed with wine was a common remedy in the ancient world to cleanse wounds and assuage <b>their</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E

25|$|The game {{tells the}} story of an unnamed protagonist who {{receives}} a frightened message from his brother asking for help.

25|$|In a 2005 study, {{researchers}} {{mentioned that}} when couples forgive their spouses they sometimes need help from professionals to overcome <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> {{that might be}} left behind. Researchers also described the difference between how each individual perceives the situation based on who is in pain and who caused the pain. Also how the couple react to the situation based on their feelings and how they personally response to the situation.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how a child’s {{experience}} of pain affects his or her parents. Using a vignette methodology, this study investigated the emotional responses of parents who were asked to imagine different painful situations that their child might experience. A sample of 650 parents of school children (325 mothers; 325 fathers) read 8 short stories/vignettes about their child, which varied in terms of type of situation (pain vs other stressful situation), intensity (high vs low), and frequency of occurrence (high vs low). The role of individual differences in parental catastrophizing about <b>their</b> child’s <b>pain,</b> catastrophizing about <b>their</b> own <b>pain,</b> dispositional empathy, and gender was also investigated. Parents’ dispositional empathy {{was found to have}} an impact on parental distress and concern for their child. Catastrophizing about <b>their</b> child’s <b>pain</b> had a unique contribution to parents’ emotional responses to the vignettes describing <b>their</b> child in <b>pain,</b> beyond the influence of other variables. The impact of parental catastrophizing about <b>their</b> child’s <b>pain</b> was most pronounced for parental distress, probably reflecting the high threat value that they attribute to <b>their</b> child’s <b>pain.</b> The findings are discussed within recent models of empathy and pain, delineating possible relationships with parents’ behavioral responses to <b>their</b> child’s <b>pain.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Riemann, {{and more}} {{specifically}} Clifford, conjectured that forces and matter might be local irregularities in the curvature of space, and in this they were strikingly prophetic, though for <b>their</b> <b>pains</b> they were dismissed {{at the time as}} visionaries.|$|R

25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{children}} receiving Carnatic classical musical training were in advantage for phonological awareness (PA) and verbal working memory (VWM) along with enhanced pitch perception abilities. It {{was also found}} that the children who had undergone longer duration of training showed better performance in these areas. Post-operative patients can ease <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> and reduce their dependence on pain-killers by listening to one of the famous Ragas of Carnatic music, Anandha Bhairavi.|$|E
25|$|The film is {{dedicated}} to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan's brother Frankie, who {{died at the age}} of ten. In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co-writers) Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} on August 3, 2007 that Chidester's parents intended to sue 'Ethnosupply'—a Canadian-based Internet company that sold Salvia divinorum to Brett some {{four months before}} his death. The parents allege that the distributors knew salvia could be dangerous and failed to warn their son. The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering, lost future earnings, funeral expenses, etc. There has not been anywhere else, either before or since this controversial incident, any other reported cases involving or alleging Salvia divinorum as a serious factor in suicide, overdose, accidental, or {{any other kind of}} death.|$|E
50|$|The {{story is}} set in a luxurious Parisian brothel (a maison close, like Le Chabanais) in the dawning of the 20th century and follows the closeted life of a group of prostitutes: their rivalries, their hopes, their fears, their pleasures, and <b>their</b> <b>pains.</b>|$|R

25|$|Although {{only one}} out of every 100 bodies interred in the {{cemetery}} became naturally mummified, the concentration of this phenomenon has led to theories about how they have come about. Some believe that they are the result of people who had been buried alive, after mistakenly declared dead. These people, according to belief, died of desperation and asphyxiation and as a sign of <b>their</b> <b>pain,</b> convert into mummies. More commonly, it is likely the result of Guanjuato’s altitude or the abundance of minerals in the soil. However, all of the mummified remains were found in the cemetery’s above ground cement crypts, not in underground graves. Researchers believe the phenomenon is due to the warm, dry climate of the area, which dried out the bodies rapidly.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{randomized}} {{study in}} medical literature that {{has studied the}} response with amputation of patients who have failed the above-mentioned therapies and who continue to be miserable. Nonetheless, {{there are reports that}} on average cite about half of the patients will have resolution of <b>their</b> <b>pain,</b> while half will develop phantom limb pain and/or pain at the amputation site. It is likely that as in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain becomes chronically stimulated with pain, and late amputation may not work as well as it might be expected. In a survey of fifteen patients with CRPS Type 1, eleven responded that their life was better after amputation. Since this is the ultimate treatment of a painful extremity, it should be left as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|A schoolboy, Aminulrasyid Amzah, {{was shot}} dead by police after {{allegedly}} trying to escape from a car accident which he was involved in. Aminulrasyid was driving his sister's car without a valid driver's licence after midnight on 3 May 2010, together with his friend, Azamuddin, who was the passenger. He {{had been trying to}} flee a number of motorcyclists who were chasing both boys after their vehicle had sideswiped a car earlier that night. After Aminulrasyid was shot, his friend Azamuddin was assaulted and beaten by the police but managed to escape. The IGP and the police have made many statements to the press saying that Aminulrasyid was trying to ram a police roadblock as well as carrying a weapon in the car. Azamuddin and Aminulrasyid's family has refuted many of the police claims. Many members of the public and the opposing politicians have criticised the police's response, alluding {{to the fact that the}} police are trying to cover up the incident and fabricate evidence. The boy's family has rejected calls for an inquest into the shooting because they did not believe they would receive a fair and transparent investigation, especially from the police. Instead, they have called on the government to establish a royal commission of inquiry to investigate Aminulrasyid's death. A special eight-member panel has been formed to scrutinise the investigation of the shooting; however, opposing politicians and the boy's family have derided the formation of the panel as a publicity stunt by the government. On 24 March 2016, the High Court in Selangor awarded more than MYR400,000 in damages to the family of the victim to alleviate <b>their</b> <b>pain</b> and suffering.|$|E
