[...] In each settlement samples were collected uniformly throughout the territory, covering residential, industrial, recreational and other urban areas. <b>The</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> out directly from the soil surface and specifically traversed pits, ditches and wells from the upper soil horizon. The number of samples in each locality ranged from 30 to 1000. The published data and the materials kindly provided {{by a number of}} geochemists were also incorporated into the research. Considering the great importance of the defined contents, quantitative and quantitative emission spectral, gravimetric, X-ray fluorescence, and partly neutron activation analyses were carried out in parallel approximately in the samples. In a volume of 3-5% {{of the total number of}} samples, sampling and analyses of the inner and external controls were conducted.

5000|$|New {{geological}} findings {{close to}} Tukgahgo {{and the eastern}} ridge have been reported. In 1991, when <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> out by geologists, a rock formation 2500 ft to the southwest of Tukgahgo Mountain on the northwest trending Chilly peak (elevation 4520 ft was initially given the informal title [...] "Chilly." [...] The geologic formations of the area consist of metabasalts and amphibolites, which are enclosed as roof pendants within the hornblende diorite, granodiorite and monzonite. The intrusive rocks are inferred {{to be part of}} the Mount Kashagnak pluton. [...] A few quartz veins were also identified, though they were scattered; they are integral to the Tukgahgo Mountain fault. This fault is small and close to the summit. The fault is within the Skagway B-2 Quadrangle and has a southeast (140 degree) strike or trend, with a movement of 1480 ft; the movement is recorded as down on the northeast side compared to the southwest side. Along the fault metabasalts to the southwest are in fault contact with the diorite intrusive. Samples collected from the veins were analyzed for metals like molybdenum, platinum and palladium. One vein with visible molybdenite assayed at 1,240 ppm across the vein. Quartz veins also revealed pyrite, chalcopyrite, malachite, and molybdenite. The gold content was reported to be 0.824 ppm, while silver and copper contents were of the order of 2.70 ppm and 2,140 ppm, respectively. The mineralization is interpreted as of mid-Cretaceous age. The metallic elements identified as present in the vein structures include silver, gold, copper, with minor quantities of palladium and platinum but no mining operations have been reported.|$|E
