6000|$|... "Hans, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> now you {{are better}} able to lend me a pound than I am to lend one to you. My bag is empty, Hans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that," [...] said Mr. Tippengray to himself. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> now I was on {{the point}} of turning into a by-way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> a fine idea," [...] {{declared}} Nelly, as {{they entered}} the restaurant. Though her little manner of dignity and even restraint was evident as ever, she seemed keenly joyous over his genius.|$|R
500|$|The song {{incorporates}} the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim {{produced by the}} [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding. The song's lyrics warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves. In the song, she berates a lover who <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few years}} after his third memoir was published, Knipfel stated in a 2007 {{interview}} with Leonard Lopate that he was finished writing memoirs, and instead would concentrate on fiction. His sentiment on his memoirs was: [...] "I had three of them out before I was forty, and I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> asinine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all--nor a {{glass of}} brandy in it, if you like it. Indeed, Mr Lynch, I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> at present, {{it will be the}} better thing for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh--but {{they don't}} know. They <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because I chuck 'em under the chin. I can't do this {{technical}} stuff.... Oh, Lord! what an evening it'll be!... I suppose I'll go to a show. Nice, lonely city, what?... You come from here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honour--rubbish!" [...] {{said the}} Professor testily. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because I {{happen to have}} been exhibiting mesmerism to a parcel of old fossils, I am {{therefore}} too proud to associate with dear old friends like you? Come out of that chair, Spiegel my boy, for I shall preside now. Beer, or wine, or shnapps, my lads--call for what you like, and put it all down to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sociologist Gérald Bronner {{calls the}} notion of [...] "deradicalization" [...] flawed, saying [...] "It means {{that you can take}} an idea or a belief out of the brain, and I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>just</b> impossible" [...] and instead {{suggests}} [...] "not a kind of mental manipulation but the opposite — mind liberation, a strengthening of their intellectual immune systems".|$|R
6000|$|She smiled. Her {{eyes seemed}} to him as gentle as April pools. With great {{seriousness}} he informed himself that [...] "there were some roughnecks who would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because a girl was a manicure girl and maybe not awful well educated, she was no good, but as for him, he was a democrat, and understood people," [...] and he stood by the assertion {{that this was a}} fine girl, a good girl--but not too uncomfortably good. He inquired in a voice quick with sympathy: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you silly boy," [...] she said, with a laugh, a {{few minutes}} later, [...] "I had begun to <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> as I had to ask you for a kiss in the old times, and again when you met me, I should {{have to take this}} matter in hand. Why, I never thought of {{anything}} else. Directly I got old enough to look upon myself as a woman, and young men began to come to the house, I said to my dear father: ...|$|E
60|$|Harry {{walked on}} slowly until some {{distance}} from the town, and then threw himself down on a bank by the road and lay for a time silent and despairing. At last tears came to his relief, and his broad shoulders shook with a passion of sobbing to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> at the moment when a chance of escape was opened--just when all the dangers seemed nearly past--the girls should have fallen {{into the hands of the}} enemy, and he not there to strike a blow in their defence. To think of Jeanne--his bright, fearless Jeanne--and clinging little Virginie, in the hands of these human tigers. It was maddening! But after a time the passion of weeping calmed down, and Harry sat up suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I think, sir," [...] said Bumpus; [...] "so I <b>think.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>just</b> w'at I said {{to myself}} w'en I {{made up my mind}} for to split. Gascoyne bein' willin' then, Henry has bribed the jailer, and he intends to open the jail door for him at twelve o'clock this night, and he'll know w'at to do with his legs w'en he's got 'em free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{feel that}} I {{ought to have}} looked after Dick better. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> hardly <b>just,</b> because I have, of course, no control over him." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the game, Miller {{downplayed the}} {{inconsistency}} between the Bears' {{play in the}} first and second halves, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> our style. We run the same stuff, wear you out." [...] Safety Mike Brown, who intercepted Culpepper for 16 yards, agreed with Miller during a postgame interview, stating, [...] "The thing about this team is that we fight for 60 minutes no matter what the score is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Peter, {{looking at}} Teacher thoughtfully, [...] "they've given you that name {{because you are}} dressed {{something}} like the Thrushes. That olive-green coat, and white waistcoat all streaked and spotted with black, certainly does {{remind me of the}} Thrush family. If you were not so much smaller than any of the Thrushes I should almost think you were one myself. Why, you are not very much bigger than Chippy the Chipping Sparrow, only you've got longer legs. I suppose that's because you spend so much time on the ground. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> Teacher is the best name for you. No one who has once heard you could ever mistake you for any one else. By the way, Teacher, where did you say your nest is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was glorious," [...] she said. [...] "I knew Fred hated Frank, though Frank, silly old boy, {{was always}} taking his part with me, and scolding me because I didn't like his cousin; and I am quite, {{quite sure that}} he has had {{something}} to do with getting Frank into this dreadful scrape, and it was glorious to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> when he thought that he had got the field clear, and uncle Harry all to himself, you should suddenly appear and put his nose out of joint. That's a very unladylike expression, Harry, and I know I oughtn't to use it, but there's nothing else does so well. It's Fred's holidays now, and he is away; I expect uncle will write and tell him all about it. I wish he wouldn't, for I would give anything to see his face when he walks in and sees you sitting here and hears who you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|This is a {{point of}} view not {{generally}} appreciated. A man is apt to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because he has heard a good story he is able and entitled to repeat it. He might as well undertake to do a snake dance merely because he has seen Madame Pavlowa do one. The point of a story is apt to lie in the telling, or at least to depend upon it in a high degree. Certain stories, it is true, depend so much on the final point, or [...] "nub," [...] as we Americans call it, that they are almost fool-proof. But even these can be made so prolix and tiresome, can be so messed up with irrelevant detail, that the general effect is utter weariness relieved by a kind of shock at the end. Let me illustrate what I mean by a story with a [...] "nub" [...] or point. I will take one of the best known, so as to make no claim to originality--for example, the famous anecdote of the man who wanted to be [...] "put off at Buffalo." [...] Here it is: ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 2000 Lubich {{met with}} 5000 Christians and Muslims in Washington, D.C. At this meeting, {{the leader of}} the American Society of Muslims, Imam WarithDeen Mohammed responded to Chiara's address, giving an inkling of the depths of this communion: [...] "I read in the Bible when Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, invited his {{followers}} towash each other's feet, and I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> what we are doing. We are washing each other's feet." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2013 Globe and Mail {{article by}} Steven Chase, Ambassador Bennett was quoted saying, [...] "Freedom of {{religion}} includes the freedom {{not to have}} a particular religious faith ... I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>just</b> logically consistent." [...] The author continued, [...] "Bennett signalled his greatest priority would be believers[...]. The vast majority of people being persecuted are people of faith. They {{are the ones that are}} being killed. They are the ones that are facing legislative and regulatory restrictions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Baas," [...] {{said the}} Hottentot {{a little while}} later, squinting at me with his bead-like eyes, [...] "after all you did well to listen to my prayer and bring me with you. Old Hans is a drunkard, yes, {{or at least he}} used to be, and old Hans gambles, yes, and perhaps old Hans will go to hell. But {{meanwhile}} old Hans can think, as he thought one day before the attack on Maraisfontein, as he thought one day on the Hill of Slaughter by Dingaan's kraal, and as he thought this morning up there among the bushes. Oh! he knew how it must end. He saw that those dogs of Arabs were cutting down a tree to make a bridge across that deep stream and get round to the high ground at the back of you, whence they would have shot you all in five minutes. And now, Baas, my stomach feels very queer. There was no breakfast on the hillside and the sun was very hot. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> one tot of brandy--oh! I know, I promised not to drink, but if you give it me the sin is yours, not mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were three}} or four of them, too, stuck up on the walls of his room. Of course she goes there. He said she was a model. Of course he is fond of her. I should not have thought it of him, but men are wicked and women are fools," [...] she added, after a pause, [...] "and I do think that I am one of the most foolish of them. I am like a child who throws away a toy one minute and cries for it the next. It is horrid, and I am ashamed of myself, downright ashamed. I hate myself to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because a man is nice to me, and leaves me two {{pictures}} if he is killed, that I am to make myself miserable about him, and to feel that I could give up all my plans in life for his sake. I understand now how it is that women are content to remain what they are. It is because nature made them so. We are like weathercocks, and have no fixed point, but can be turned by a passing breath.|$|E
6000|$|The {{book was}} The People of the Abyss, by Jack London, which Mamie Magen {{had given to}} Una as an {{introduction}} to a knowledge of social conditions. Una had planned to absorb it; to learn how the shockingly poor live. Now she read the first four pages to Mr. Schwirtz. After each page {{he said that he}} was interested. At the end of the fourth page, when Una stopped for breath, he commented: [...] "Fine writer, that fella London. And they say he's quite a fella; been a sailor and a miner and all kinds of things; ver' intimate friend of mine knows him quite well--met him in 'Frisco--and he says he's been a sailor and all kinds of things. But he's a socialist. Tell you, I ain't got much time for these socialists. Course I'm kind of a socialist myself lots-a ways, but these here fellas that go around making folks discontented--! Agitators--! Don't suppose it's that way with this London--he must be pretty well fixed, and so of course he's prob'ly growing conservative and sensible. But most of these socialists are just a lazy bunch of bums that try and see how much trouble they can stir up. They <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> because they're too lazy to find an opening, that they got the right to take the money away from the fellas that hustle around and make good. Trouble with all these socialist guys is that they don't stop to realize that you can't change human nature. They want to take away all the rewards for initiative and enterprise, just as Sam Cannon was saying. Do you s'pose I'd work my head off putting a proposition through if there wasn't anything in it for me? Then, 'nother thing, about all this submerged tenth--these 'People of the Abyss,' and all the rest: I don't feel a darn bit sorry for them. They stick in London or New York or wherever they are, and live on charity, and if you offered 'em a good job they wouldn't take it. Why, look here! all through the Middle West the farmers are just looking for men at three dollars a day, and for hired girls, they'd give hired girls three and four dollars a week and a good home. But do all these people go out and get the jobs? Not a bit of it! They'd rather stay home and yelp about socialism and anarchism and Lord knows what-all. 'Nother thing: I never could figger out what all these socialists and I. W. W.'s, these 'I Won't Work's,' would do if we did divide up and hand all the industries over to them. I bet they'd be the very first ones to kick for a return to the old conditions! I tell you, it surprises me when a good, bright man like Jack London or this fella, Upton Sinclair--they say he's a well-educated fella, too--don't stop and realize these things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> quite <b>just,</b> darling, {{there are}} a great many {{politicians}} who are very much looked up to--all the bishops, for instance, and others whom nobody could suspect of self-seeking." ...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{going through}} {{chemotherapy}} at the time, Coleman {{came into the}} Derry dressing room before Derry's opening game of the 2006 Championship against reigning All-Ireland champions Tyrone. Joe Brolly said [...] "He delivered a thundering oration {{and with all the}} Derry boys, the hairs were standing up {{on the back of the}} necks. It was a genuinely motivational speech and to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> a year on, he's gone. It's very distressing." [...] Derry went on to beat Tyrone comfortably.|$|E
5000|$|Sen. Millikin: We... have mine-detecting devices, {{which are}} rather effective... I was {{wondering}} if anything of that kind might be available {{to use as a}} defense against that particular type of use of atomic bombs.Dr. Oppenheimer: If you hired me to walk through the cellars of Washington to see whether there were atomic bombs, I think my most important tool would be a screwdriver to open the crates and look. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> walking by, swinging a little gadget would not give me the information. [...] This sparked further work on the question of smuggled atomic devices during the 1950s.|$|E

5000|$|Concerning {{his three}} quarreling sisters Robert said, [...] "Those three sisters are good as gold, {{but they just}} don't seem to {{understand}} each other all the time. And then there are stories about 'boy friends' and it is all rot and just made up for spite." [...] He felt that strife in the family may have caused Elmo to leave — [...] "Sometimes I don't blame Elmo, because in 1930 I went away {{for a couple of years}} myself to Tucson, Ariz. to get away from it. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>just</b> what he did." ...|$|R
