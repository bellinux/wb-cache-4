5|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> {{comprised}} around 200 {{men at the}} start, and Gens appointed Salk Dessler as {{his deputy}} commandant. Other chief subordinates included Joseph Muszkat and Meir Levas. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the Betar, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> included many other former Betar members, and {{this may have been}} because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the Bund, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>force</b> {{to be more of a}} militia, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.|$|E
