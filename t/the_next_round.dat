If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>round</b> or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>round.</b> In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E
