40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} effect of short-chain fatty-acids on atrophy and {{inflammation}} of excluded colonic segments {{before and after the}} development of diversion colitis. INTRODUCTION: Diversion colitis is a chronic inflammatory process affecting the dysfunctional colon, possibly evolving with mucous and blood discharge. The most favored hypotheses to explain its development is short-chain fatty-acid deficiency in the colon lumen. METHODS: Wistar rats were submitted to colostomy with distal colon exclusion. Two control groups (A 1 and B 1) received rectally administered physiological saline, whereas two experimental groups (A 2 and B 2) received rectally administered short-chain fatty-acids. The A groups were prophylactically treated (5 th to 40 th days postoperatively), whereas the B groups were therapeutically treated (after post-operative day 40). The mucosal thickness of the excluded colon was measured histologically. The inflammatory reaction of the mucosal lamina propria and the lymphoid tissue response were quantified through established scores. RESULTS: There was a significant <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> of the colonic mucosa in group B 2 animals (p = 0. 0001), which also exhibited a significant {{reduction in the number of}} eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria (p = 0. 0126) and in the intestinal lumen (p = 0. 0256). Group A 2 showed no mucosal <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> and significant increases in the numbers of lymphocytes (p = 0. 0006) and eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa (p = 0. 0022). CONCLUSION: Therapeutic use of short-chain fatty-acids significantly reduced eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cell numbers in the intestinal wall and in the colonic lumen; it also reversed the atrophy of the colonic mucosa. Prophylactic use did not impede the development of mucosal atroph...|$|E

40|$|Utilization of {{synchrotron}} X-ray microtomography {{has enabled}} the virtual reconstruction of invisible microstructural units and their deformation during the compaction, compression and recovery of flexible graphite. Particles artificially affixed, in advance, {{to the surface}} of a given microstructural unit were connected by plane triangles to create a 3 D mesh in the reconstruction. High density 3 D mapping of strain and displacement has also been achieved, by tracing the physical displacement of the surface particles. Micro-mechanisms of compression and recovery behavior in flexible graphite have been examined involving the direct observations and measurements. The microstructural unit was found to be composed of thin expanded graphite discs with slightly misaligned basal planes of graphite. Highly localized deformation of a thin expanded graphite disc was observed during the compression and recovery processes, suggesting strong interaction with surrounding expanded graphite discs. The macroscopic compression behavior of flexible graphite is attributable to a combination of bending and thickness reduction/recovery of the discs.

Here, we investigated mechanical deformation and shape recovery of bulk carbon nanotube sponges immersed in various liquid oils under repeated compression cycles at large strains (50 %). The nanotube sponges show virtually elastic recovery to their original volume (> 98 %) {{in the presence of}} oil, compared to other media such as air or water in which significant plastic deformation occurs. Oil was squeezed out of the sponge pores during compression and then sucked into the sponges to enable structure recovery when load is released, indicating the possibility for recycled oil adsorption.

30|$|Reservoir {{thickness}} is {{an important}} factor that affects the development effect of steam injection. The development methods used in a thick reservoir usually differ from that in a thin one. Thin reservoirs often cause serious heat loss. Thus, the heat efficiency of the injected hot medium is reduced. But in thick reservoirs, heat utilization may also be reduced because of steam override. In the simulation part, numerical models with thickness ranges from 3 to 6  m are built. The results are shown in Fig.  6. When the reservoir thickness is lower than 5  m, oil recovery is enhanced remarkably as <b>thickness</b> increases. Oil <b>recoveries</b> for cases of 5  m and 6  m are 16.4 % and 16.6 %, respectively, and it tends to be stable when the thickness is higher than 5  m. As the thickness increases, the action of gravity becomes more and more serious, and the vertical sweep efficiency is limited. Therefore, the reservoir thickness limit that is suitable for hot-water flooding is 5  m.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the role of ureteric stents in relieving obstruction and improvement of kidney function in patients with obstructive uropathy. Materials and Methods: This study involved 138 patients with obstructive uropathy with age ranged from 2 months to 73 years. Patients classified into two groups: Group (I) : Includes 57 patients (41. 3 %), ureteric stents fixed to them; and Group (II) : Includes 81 patients (58. 6 %) managed by other treatment modalities. All patients underwent clinical assessment, Laboratory and radiologic investigations: At presentation and postoperative. These included: Complete urine analysis, urine culture and sensitivity, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, serum sodium (Na), serum potassium (K), Fasting blood glucose level and blood picture and plain X-ray (KUB), abdominal ultrasonography (US), diuretic renography and retrograde pyelography. Results: Renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was used as an indicator for improvement of renal function after fixation of ureteric stent. In group I: 56 (71. 8 %) kidneys showed significant recovery compared to 61 kidneys (66. 3 %). In group II, there is statistically significant relation between renal perfusion and renal recovery (P < 0. 004), statistically significant relation between parenchymal <b>thickness</b> and <b>recovery</b> in both groups (P < 0. 0002), statistically significant relation between degree of corticomedullary differentiation and recovery (P < 0. 0003) and statistically significant relationship between hemoglobin levels at presentation and the recoverability (P < 0. 002).

In the present work, environment-friendly silica aerogel composites are fabricated using silica aerogel granules with bio based porcine-gelatin as the binding agent dissolved {{in water and}} by further drying the mix at sub-zero condition. This article focuses on improvement studies carried on the mold design and the manufacturing process to achieve better geometric compliance for the silica aerogel composites.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the acute effects of isolated eccentric and concentric calf muscle exercise on Achilles tendon sagittal thickness. Design: Within-subject, counterbalanced, mixed design. Setting: Institutional. Participants: 11 healthy, recreationally active male adults. Interventions: Participants performed an exercise protocol, which involved isolated eccentric loading of the Achilles tendon {{of a single}} limb and isolated concentric loading of the contralateral, both {{with the addition of}} 20 % bodyweight. Main outcome measurements: Sagittal sonograms were acquired prior to, immediately following and 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after exercise. Tendon thickness was measured 2 cm proximal to the superior aspect of the calcaneus. Results: Both loading conditions resulted in an immediate decrease in normalised Achilles tendon thickness. Eccentric loading induced a significantly greater decrease than concentric loading despite a similar impulse (− 0. 21 vs − 0. 05, p< 0. 05). Post-exercise, eccentrically loaded tendons recovered exponentially, with a recovery time constant of 2. 5 h. The same exponential function did not adequately model changes in tendon thickness resulting from concentric loading. Even so, recovery pathways subsequent to the 3 h time point were comparable. Regardless of the exercise protocol, full tendon <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> was not observed until 24 h. Conclusions: Eccentric loading invokes a greater reduction in Achilles tendon thickness immediately after exercise but appears to recover fully in a similar time frame to concentric loading...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveMeniscectomy-induced {{osteoarthritis}} may be mechanically based. We {{asked how}} meniscectomy alters time-dependent deformation of physiologically loaded articular cartilage. We hypothesized that meniscectomy alters nominal strain in tibial articular cartilage, and that meniscectomy affects cartilage <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> following cessation of loading. MethodsA cyclic load simulating normal gait {{was applied to}} four sheep knees. A custom device was used to obtain MR images of cartilage at 4. 7 T during cyclic loading. Articular cartilage thickness and nominal strain were measured every 2. 5 min during 1 h of cyclic loading, and during 2. 5 h after cessation of loading. ResultsFollowing meniscectomy the loaded joints rapidly developed high strain centrally and minimal strain peripherally. Maximum nominal strains after 1 h of loading were about 55 % in the intact knees and 72 % in the meniscectomized knees. Nominal strains in the peripheral tibial cartilage were significantly reduced in the meniscectomized knees. Strain recovery was markedly prolonged in the meniscectomized knees. ConclusionsWith meniscectomy, tibial articular cartilage in the central load bearing region remains chronically deformed and dehydrated, even after cessation of loading. Post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis may be initiated in this region by direct damage to the cartilage matrix, or by altering the hydration of the tissue. In peripheral regions, reduced loading and strain may facilitate subchondral vascular invasion, and endochondral ossification. This {{is consistent with the}} central fibrillation and peripheral osteophyte formation seen in post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis...|$|E

METHODS: Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were divided into four groups. The AAA model was developed via a 20 -minute periaortic incubation of CaCl 2 (0. 5 mol/L) and elastase (1 Unit/µL) in a 1. 5 -cm aortic segment (Group CE). A single incubation of CaCl 2 (Group C) or elastase (Group E) and a sham operation group (Sham Group) were used for the controls. Diameter was measured by serial digital subtraction angiography imaging on days 5, 15 and 30. Animals were sacrificed on day 5 and day 30 for histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: All animals in Group CE developed aneurysm, with an average dilation ratio of 65. 3 % ± 8. 9 % on day 5, 86. 5 % ± 28. 7 % on day 15 and 203. 6 % ± 39. 1 % on day 30. No aneurysm was found in Group C, and only one aneurysm was seen on day 5 in Group E. Group CE exhibited less intima-media <b>thickness,</b> endothelial <b>recovery,</b> elastin and smooth muscle cell (SMC) content, but stronger expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 and RAM 11 compared to the controls.

40|$|Until recently, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were {{predominantly}} developed for {{applications in the}} biomedical and engineering industry, and {{only a limited number}} of applications in textiles are known. Fabrics made of natural fibres (e. g. cotton, flax and their mixtures) present many advantages, such as wearing comfort, but they are subject to creasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of compensating for this disadvantage by using SMAs to create aesthetic low crease flax/cotton fabrics. Body Temperature SMAs (BT SMA) that regain their (straight) form when they are subject to human body temperature were used for this purpose. Clothing and bed sheeting are potential applications of these hybrid structures, which become wrinkle-free when they are exposed to the heat of the body, a hair dryer or that generated by an electrical current. The materials selected to achieve this purpose were the following: (1) textile yarns (e. g. single cotton or flax/cotton yarns, two-fold flax yarns and two types of loop fancy yarns) and (2) BT SMA wires of 300 mu m diameter. A power weaving loom and a hand-weaving shuttle loom were used to embed the SMA wires, and four types of hybrid fabrics were produced.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{tendency}} of wood to shrink and swell with changing moisture content remains {{as one of}} the most significant challenges to using wood in its many applications. Viscoelastic Thermal Compression (VTC) has been shown to significantly increase the density, strength and stiffness of wood. However, dimensional stability is still a concern. Active and passive chemical modifications have been developed which impart dimensional stability by chemically altering the wood substrate or physically blocking the vital pathways of water through the wood microstructure. The efforts of this research have been to develop an approach which combines the VTC process with a chemical modification process resulting in a novel wood-based product that exhibits improved structural properties, as well as a high degree of dimensional stability. Low-grade, plantation-grown hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) was impregnated with low molecular weight phenol-formaldehyde resin, acetic anhydride or tung oil and then densified in the VTC process. Water soak and boil tests were performed to investigate the influence of each treatment on thickness swell, antiswelling efficiency (ASE), irreversible swelling, and <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery.</b> Modulus of elasticity (MOE) was also examined for each treatment. Fluorescence microscopy was applied to determine the physical location and distribution of the impregnating reagents to better understand their role in imparting dimensional stability.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{introduce}} a new model describing human in vivo corneal deswelling after hypoxic contact lens wear, based on a damped harmonic oscillator, which can describe an overshoot in corneal deswelling, to compare this new model with the currently used exponential model, and also to test whether a diurnal variation in baseline corneal thickness exists {{that would have to}} be taken into consideration when calculating corneal deswelling curves. METHODS: In nine healthy young adults, corneal thickness was measured every 30 minutes for 11. 5 hours on average using modified optical pachometry (natural test). On another day, corneal deswelling was monitored for 11. 1 hours on average after 2 hours of hypoxic contact lens wear (stress test). The damped harmonic oscillator model and the exponential model were used to calculate best-fitting deswelling curves. Natural test data were analyzed for the presence of a trend. Goodness of fit of the curves to the experimental data was analyzed using the F test. RESULTS: In 82 % of the deswelling curves the new damped harmonic oscillator model provided a better fit to the data than the exponential model (P < 0. 05). An average overshoot in corneal <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> of 5 microm (range, 0 - 11 microm) was found. In 50 % of the natural tests significant trends were found, without any consistent similarities. The overshoot could not be explained by these trends.

40|$|When {{synovial}} joints are loaded, the {{articular cartilage}} and the cells residing in it deform. Cartilage deformation has {{been related to}} structural tissue damage, and cell deformation {{has been associated with}} cell signalling and corresponding anabolic and catabolic responses. Despite the acknowledged importance of cartilage and cell deformation, there are no dynamic data on these measures from joints of live animals using muscular load application. Research in this area has typically been done using confined and unconfined loading configurations and indentation testing. These loading conditions can be well controlled and allow for accurate measurements of cartilage and cell deformations, but they {{have little to do with}} the contact mechanics occurring in a joint where non-congruent cartilage surfaces with different material and functional properties are pressed against each other by muscular forces.

Fifty and 80 % of the maximal knee extensor muscular force (equivalent to approximately 0. 4 N and 0. 6 N) produced average peak articular cartilage strains of 10. 5 ± 1. 0 % and 18. 3 ± 1. 3 % (Mean ± SD), respectively, during 8 s contractions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to determine the}} effects of press temperature and pressing time on the density distribution of particleboards throughout the thickness, and to make clear the relation of the density distribution to the strength properties of these boards. Wood particle used in this experiment was splinter type (5 - 16 mesh) of Lauan. The bond used was phenol resin and its solid content was 6 % (OD) for weight of a particle-mat. Distance piece of 15 mm thick was used and press temperature was varied within the range of 130 to 190 °C, and pressing time 10 - 35 min. The density distribution of particleboard was measured by soft x-ray and densitometric method. The results obtained will be summarized as follows: (1) The percentages of <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> of particleboards after hot-pressing decrease rapidly with increasing of pressing time as shown in Fig. 1, and critical pressing time is about 25 min for 130 °C of press temperature and about 15 min for 150 - 190 °C of press temperature. (2) The consolidation progress of each layer within particle-mat and the variation of density distribution of the particleboard through the thickness during hot-pressing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3. These figures indicate that the final type of density distribution of particleboards which are hot pressed with distance piece at the different press temperature in the range of 130 - 190 °C are not differ from each other. However, the density distribution of the particleboard which is hot-pressed without distance piece is differ from them (Fig. 4). (3) The bending strength of particleboards depend primarily on the density of the face (back), and so, the values are scarecely affected by press temperature and pressing time after the layers have been consolidated (Fig. 5). In contrast with this, the internal bonding strength depend chiefly on the density of the core layer, and so, the values are affected by the two factors till the consolidation progress of the layer has been completed (Fig. 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversitySuccessful {{continuous}} or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites requires {{development of}} the underpinning science, including a suitable binding system, forming defect management, and process-property relationships. A hybrid resin to stabilize the wood-strand preforms for subsequent profile forming and curing was devised using a mixture of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. This study examined the influence of PVAc on the cure kinetics of PF with differential scanning calorimetry. Results show that the cure kinetics of PF blended with PVAc does not differ significantly from neat PF resin for blend ratios of 1 or lower. The nth-order Borchardt Daniels model provided good prediction for the curing of adhesive system with a PVAc/PF ratio lower than 1 and neat PF resin. This blended resin system can potentially be used for continuous or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites. To gain an initial understanding, the complex state of deformations in wood-strand preforms during profiling forming was studied using single-curvature bending. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in bending, buckling and shear slip. The initial failure in bending was predicted with a strength-based model {{with the goal of}} minimizing defects, such as buckling. A relationship between preform conditions, forming defects and <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> was established. Profile-formed wood-strand composites showed much better shape conformance than profiled veneer-based composites. Slow closing rate and relatively high moisture content caused flat and peak-at-core vertical density profiles (VDP). Lower moisture content resulted in more uniform VDP. The internal stress state in the bend of the profile-formed V-specimens was determined with elastic curved beam theory. Delamination, dominated by radial stress, was the initial failure mode. The Chang-Springer failure criterion was used to determine the initiation of delamination failure within the bend of the V-specimens on roller support. V-specimens tested on pin support yielded greater bending strength than those on roller support. These support conditions provide lower and upper bounds for stresses in the bend of the specimen for some applications. This study adds to the limited knowledge base of profile forming of wood-strand composites and provides an insight into process-property relationships.

40|$|Biotextiles are fibrous {{structures}} {{created from}} synthetic or natural materials, {{which are used}} as biodegradable temporary scaffolds in tissue engineering. The function of such cell-seeded devices is to heal or replace damaged organs or tissues. Biocompatibility and retention of mechanical properties in the relatively hostile environment is required from the fiber materials. Porosity, pore sizes and pore shapes affect cell coverage and distribution on the scaffolds. Textile manufacturing techniques provide a vast variety of available structures in both small and large scale production. The aim of this thesis was to compare cell viability and distribution on textile scaffolds. For this purpose melt spinning method was used to process poly-L/D-lactide 96 / 4 (PLDLA 96 / 4) fibers. A 36 -week hydrolytic degradation experiment was conducted for the gamma irradiated fibers to evaluate retention of mechanical properties and changes in crystallinity and thermal properties. Tensile testing method was used for mechanical properties and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the two last mentioned. The fibers were used to manufacture braided, knitted and woven fabrics. Heat sealing and compression at elevated temperature was used to prepare multi-layered scaffolds with approximately 1 mm <b>thickness.</b> <b>Recovery</b> after heat treatment and swelling in cell culture medium was evaluated for the scaffolds. Human urothelial cells (hUCs) and human foreskin fibroblasts (hFFs) {{were used in the}} cell culture experiment. Live/Dead analysis and crystal violet staining were used to assess cell viability and distribution. Tensile strength of the PLDLA 96 / 4 fibers decreased during degradation as did strain at maximum load. Crystallinity increased with a few percent. Glass transition temperature decreased, as was predicted based on previous studies. Unexpectedly, the melting temperature showed a slight increase during degradation. In the recovery and swelling experiments, unwanted changes were not observed. The cell culture experiment demonstrated good biocompatibility for the fibers. After 2 weeks of incubation, the less porous braided and woven scaffolds had the most attached hUC and hFF cells. The large pores of knitted scaffolds remained mostly cell free for both cell types throughout the experiment. The experiments conducted for this thesis demonstrated that PLDLA 96 / 4 fiber bundles can be processed into biodegradable braided, knitted and woven textile scaffolds. These structures support viability of cells in vitro. The number of attached cells was the largest in braided and woven structures that had significantly smaller pores in comparison to knitted scaffolds...|$|E

To support the discussion, the anatomical and physical characterizations of the wood were carried out. The panels were produced by applying three different press pressures (0. 88, 1. 18 and 1. 47 MPa) and with six combinations of wood veneers. Phenol-formaldehyde resin was employed, 160 g m- 2 in a simple line and 35 % solid content. The anatomical analysis revealed that the sapwood is more permeable than the H. dulcis heartwood. The H. dulcis wood basic density it was higher than that of the P. elliottii. Increased press pressure raised the values of the apparent density, thickness swelling and <b>thickness</b> swelling plus <b>recovery</b> of the plywood and water absorption reduction. The panels produced with H. dulcis veneers presented higher apparent density, MOR, MOE and bonding line resistance, as well as lower water absorption and moisture content, than those produced with P. elliottii veneers. No difference was noticed regarding the plywood properties when the main effects were evaluated in relation to the use of H. dulcis heartwood and sapwood veneers...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{removal of}} material conducted {{with the tip of}} an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe is a technique that has started gaining increased attention in recent years within the micro and nano manufacturing research community. The attractive characteristics of this process are that it is relatively simple to implement and low-cost compared with vacuum-based lithography techniques for micro and nano fabrication. However, similarly to any machining process, the resulting surface finish of features cut with an AFM probe can be critical. In this context, the focus of the paper is on the development and validation of a novel analytical model for predicting the floor surface roughness induced by AFM probe-based machining when generating cavities composed of linear parallel grooves. In addition to kinematic parameters, the proposed model takes into account the minimum chip <b>thickness</b> and elastic <b>recovery</b> associated with each phase present within the microstructure of a workpiece. The implementation of the model was carried out and its performance tested when processing a dual phase brass alloy using an AFM nano-indentation probe. A relatively good agreement was achieved between the analytical and experimental results with an average prediction error of 21 % when assessing the arithmetic average roughness, Ra...|$|R
40|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{for measuring}} the cortical thickness in the human brain from MR image volumes have been described in the literature, the majority of which rely on fitting deformable models to {{the inner and outer}} cortical surfaces. However, the constraints applied during the model fitting process in order to enforce spherical topology and to fit the outer cortical surface in narrow sulci, where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) channel may be obscured by partial voluming, may introduce bias in some circumstances, and greatly increase the processor time required. In this paper we describe an alternative, voxel based technique that measures the cortical <b>thickness</b> using inversion <b>recovery</b> anatomical MR images. Grey matter, white matter and CSF are identified through segmentation, and edge detection is used to identify the boundaries between these tissues. The cortical thickness is then measured along the local 3 D surface normal at every voxel on the inner cortical surface. The method was applied to 119 normal volunteers, and validated through extensive comparisons with published measurements of both cortical thickness and rate of thickness change with age. We conclude that the proposed technique is generally faster than deformable model-based alternatives, and free from the possibility of model bias, but suffers no reduction in accuracy. In particular, it will be applicable in data sets showing severe cortical atrophy, where thinning of the gyri leads to points of high curvature, and so the fitting of deformable models is problematic...|$|R
40|$|We present new pollen-temperature reconstructions for the Last Interglacial {{from central}} North Island, New Zealand using partial least squares {{regression}} (PLS) and modern analogue technique applied with the New Zealand pre-deforestation calibration pollen dataset. The pollen-bearing organic sequence includes numerous millimetre- to decimetre- thick tephra {{mostly from the}} adjacent Tongariro Volcanic Centre and is overlain by tephric cover-beds including the c. 25. 4 ka cal BP Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra. Fine-resolution pollen and preliminary diatom analyses above and below prominent tephra layers showed that significant vegetation impact followed only the thickest ashfall event (22 cm <b>thickness),</b> with vegetation <b>recovery</b> taking several hundred years. Apart from this, changes in the longer-term pollen record {{are likely to be}} related to climate oscillations that resemble the classic five-fold subdivision of MIS 5. The warmest interval, ascribed to MIS 5 e, was characterised by tall, temperate rainforest, and occurs {{at the base of the}} sequence, with mean annual temperatures reaching around 1. 1 °C higher than present. Mean annual temperatures declined to ~ 4 °C below present during MIS 5 d and MIS 5 b and were within 1 – 2 °C of present during MIS 5 c. The PLS temperature reconstructions are corroborated by estimates derived independently from elevational changes to vegetation communities, corresponding to modern temperature controls, inferred from the Karioi pollen spectra. Temperatures reconstructed quantitatively by the modern analogue technique were up to 1. 3 °C higher for MIS 5 e, MIS 5 d and MIS 5 b, possibly reflecting weaker modern vegetation analogues for these intervals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Intra-articular {{corticosteroids}} {{are widely}} used as anti-inflammatory agents for symptomatic management of arthritis, but their administration with concurrent exercise remains controversial. Biochemical and morphologic analysis of treated cartilage has revealed conflicting results, but previous biomechanical assessment has not been undertaken. Objective: To compare the biomechanical properties of intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) and diluent treated cartilage in treadmill exercised horses. Methods: Eight 2 -year-old female horses had MPA or diluent administered into contralateral middle carpal joints at 14 day intervals {{for a total of}} four treatments per horse. Horses underwent a standard treadmill exercise protocol until euthanasia (day 70). Standard sites were tested on the third, radial and intermediate carpal bones using an automated indentation apparatus to obtain the creep and recovery behavior of the articular cartilage. Using previously validated biphasic creep indentation methodology, aggregate modulus, Poisson's ratio, permeability, shear modulus, <b>thickness,</b> creep and <b>recovery</b> equilibrium times and percent recovery were obtained at each site. Results were analyzed using ANOVA and multiple comparisons of the means (P< 0. 05). Results: Cartilage intrinsic material properties and thickness demonstrated significant differences between MPA and diluent treated joints. Diluent treated cartilage had a 97 % increase in compressive stiffness modulus (P= 0. 0001) was 121 % more permeable (P= 0. 0001), had 88 % increase in shear modulus (P= 0. 0001), and was 24 % thicker (P= 0. 0001) than MPA treated articular cartilage. Conclusions: The findings indicate that repetitive intra-articular administration of MPA to exercising horses alters the mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, which could lead to early cartilage degeneration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Microdialysis of {{subcutaneous}} {{adipose tissue}} may {{provide an opportunity}} to monitor glucose continuously, when the device is connected to an extracorporal glucose sensor. We assessed whether our microdialysis probes are capable of measuring adipose tissue glucose over a prolonged period in Type 1 diabetic patients. Furthermore, the relationship between abdominal skinfold <b>thickness</b> and glucose <b>recovery</b> and the effect of spontaneous glucose excursions on its recovery were evaluated. Methods: Microdialysis probes were pairwise inserted subcutaneously into the abdominal fat and remained in situ for 3 weeks in eight Type 1 diabetic patients. At days 1, 3, 4, 8, 11, 16, and 18 of probe retention, glucose, as measured by microdialysis, was compared to capillary blood glucose concentrations during a 4 h period. The recovery of glucose obtained by microdialysis was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} capillary blood glucose concentration. Results: Eleven of the 16 inserted probes (69 %) were evaluable during the complete study. Recovery of glucose was lower at day 1 and 3 (51 +/- 23 % and 56 +/- 18 %, respectively, mean+/-S. D.) compared to values found afterwards (67 +/- 19 %, 72 +/- 13 %, 76 +/- 14 %, 71 +/- 16 %, and 76 +/- 18 %, for day 4, 8, 11, 16, and 18, respectively, for all P < 0. 05 vs. day 1 and 3). Skinfold thickness was inversely related to the overall 3 week glucose recovery (r = - 0. 76; P < 0. 03). Recovery was similar over a wide range of capillary blood glucose concentrations. Conclusions: Prolonged in vivo retention of microdialysis probes improves the recovery and lowers the variability of adipose tissue-sampled glucose in Type 1 diabetic patients. These findings show that microdialysis-based glucose measurements offer an opportunity for prolonged glucose monitoring. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

H 577 P ISE 2016 Huangxxvi, 171 pages :color illustrationsThe aerostatic bearing spindle (ABS) {{is a vital}} {{component}} in ultra-precision machine tools. The performance of the ABS {{is an important factor}} in determining the machining quality in ultra-precision machining. Many studies have been conducted to measure the spindle error motions, and three typical measurement techniques, which are reversal, multi-probe and multi-step approaches, have been extensively utilized. However, few studies focus on the spindle dynamic errors. Motivated by this research gap, this study adopts theoretical and experimental approaches to study the spindle dynamic errors and their effects on the machining quality in ultra-precision machining. The study was divided into two parts. In the first part, the spindle dynamic errors were investigated with theoretical and experimental methods. Firstly, a spindle dynamics model of ABS was developed to characterize the spindle dynamic behavior. A series of experiments, including groove cutting with diamond turning and fabrication of microstructures with slow slide servo (S 3) machining, were conducted. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that the unbalance induced eccentricity has significant effects on the machining accuracy in ultra-precision machining, even though the amplitude of spindle error motion is in the range of several tens of nanometers. The spindle has a double frequency vibration under excitations, including spindle unbalance and cutting force. The double frequency vibration can generate a low frequency enveloping phenomenon. In addition, the results indicate that the axis average line (AAL) of the spindle rotation axis will drift away from the bearing center with increase of spindle speed due to the hydrodynamic effect of the ABS. This drift of the AAL of the spindle rotation axis with increase of spindle speed is nonlinear. The drift makes significant contribution to the machining accuracy in the fabrication of microstructures with S 3 machining, where two different spindle speeds are employed. In the second part, a comprehensive dynamic surface generation model with consideration of the spindle dynamics, cutting mechanism and machining error is proposed. Firstly, an algorithm for the cutting force calculation and surface generation is developed. This algorithm takes into account the effect of minimum chip <b>thickness</b> and elastic <b>recovery.</b> A groove cutting experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm is capable of addressing the minimum chip <b>thickness</b> and elastic <b>recovery</b> in the micro cutting process. This algorithm is integrated into the comprehensive dynamic surface generation model. The simulated and measured surface topographies indicate that the low frequency enveloping phenomenon due to double frequency vibration of the spindle has a significant effect on the surface topography. The surface topography in cylindrical turning changes with different spindle speeds, even though the feed rate per revolution remains unchanged. In ultra-precision machining, the requirement of ultra-high machining accuracy and ultra-smooth surface roughness makes the effects of spindle errors on form accuracy and surface finish of machined components highly significant, even though the spindle errors can be down to the nanometric range. Thus, it is very significant for this research to investigate the effect of spindle errors on machining accuracy and surface roughness with experimental and theoretical methods. Based on the investigation, the spindle unbalance induced eccentricity, double frequency vibration, as well as the position drift of the AAL of the ABS have been identified. The development of the comprehensive dynamic surface generation model with consideration of spindle dynamics, effect of tool edge radius and machining error can enable optimization of the cutting conditions in ultra-precision diamond turning.

40|$|Chronic {{hypobaric}} hypoxia induces structural features {{characteristic of}} pulmonary hypertension, but {{little is known}} of their reversal. In the present study, rats {{have been exposed to}} hypobaric hypoxia for 10 days and subsequently allowed to recover in room air for 3, 14, 28, or 70 days. With the use of 1 -mu sections and electron-microscopic and point-counting techniques, the regression of the medial and adventitial changes in the rat hilar intrapulmonary artery has been followed. In the media, 10 -day hypoxia causes more than a doubling in thickness due to 1) hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells, particularly of rough sarcoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; 2) an increase in extracellular connective tissue, microfibrils, collagen fibers, and elastin, and 3) edemalike fluid. In addition, the elestic laminas are doubled in thickness, and myofilamentous processes of the hypertrophied smooth muscle cells contact them. After just 3 days' recovery, some cells have already returned to normal diameter, although medial thickening is unchanged. By Day 14 and at Days 28 and 70 of <b>recovery,</b> medial <b>thickness</b> and cell diameter are within the normal range, and by recovery Day 70, there is {{a significant increase in the}} relative areal proportion of extracellular collagen fibers and a decrease in elastin (P less than 0. 001). Hypoxia also produces a more than twofold increase in adventitial thickness. Hypertrophy of fibroblasts and an increase in their number contribute to the thickening, as does as increase in collagen fibers. During 3 - 70 days of <b>recovery,</b> <b>thickness</b> is gradually reduced to normal levels, although it is still significantly above normal at Days 3, 14, and 28. The increases in thickness at these times are due mainly to the accumulation of collagen fibers, which are still apparent after 70 days of recovery. Thus, hypoxia causes a doubling in thickness of the medial and adventitial coats of the hilar muscular pulmonary artery, which with recovery regain near normal thickness but whose structure is altered. The increase in collagen fibers contributes to contracture and reduced distensibility in these vessels, which is apparent in arteriograms as narrowed lumen diameter...|$|R
40|$|The {{opening delay}} of a {{discharge}} reed valve for compressors {{caused by the}} stiction force of the oil film between the reed and the valve seat is investigated. The coupling simulation algorithm including models of cavitation in the oil film is developed. In order to check the validity, the numerical simulation is performed under several conditions of a model experiment. The coupling model consists of the reed deformation, the gas flow, and the oil film flow with cavitation. The two-dimensional reed deformation is expressed by expanding natural modes that are obtained by the finite element method using shell elements. The gas flow is expressed by the thermodynamic model under the assumption of the internal reversible process. The two-dimensional oil film pressure distribution is obtained by solving numerically the Reynolds’ equation through the finite volume method. On the model of cavitation in the oil film, {{in addition to the}} case in which cavitation is not taken into account, two cavitation models are tested; the static cavitation model (Reynolds’ condition) in which the minimum oil pressure is set to absolute zero, and the dynamic cavitation model in which the oil film pressure can fall to the absolute negative (tensile in the liquid) due to the direct simulation of the bubble expansion. Comparisons on the opening delay time between simulation results and the experimental result show that the static cavitation model gives the earlier delay time than that in the experiment, and the dynamic cavitation model which simulates the absolute negative pressure in the oil film reproduces accurately the experimental delay time. The simulation through the dynamic cavitation model also reproduces well behaviors of cavitation and blow-by flow (oil film rupture) in the oil film captured by the high-speed camera in the experiment. The relation among the pressure, the thickness, and the cavitation area of the oil film that are obtained in the simulation shows the mechanism of the oil film rupture (valve opening), i. e., the cavitation bubbles promote the increase of the oil film thickness during the stiction and the increased oil film <b>thickness</b> causes the <b>recovery</b> of the oil film pressure, and the subsequent blow-by flow (oil film rupture) ...|$|R
