5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
5|$|The vestibule's {{interior}} decoration is also described by Procopius: {{the walls were}} decorated with slabs of multi-colored marble, while <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> were covered with mosaics, which depicted Justinian and his empress Theodora flanked by the Senate, {{as well as the}} victories of Belisarius in the Vandalic and Gothic wars and his triumphal return bearing spoils, defeated kings and kingdoms to his emperor.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discovery}} of the wreck site, Ballard returned to Titanic in July 1986 aboard the research vessel RV Atlantis II. Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended the ruined Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, and photographed remarkably well preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|J-hook (Claw hook) system. {{a type of}} {{mounting}} system where <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> fan hangs on a metal hook, attached to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> A rubber grommet is used to keep the fan in place and helps avoid vibration on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>ceiling</b> is <b>the</b> dropped <b>ceiling</b> which is {{suspended}} from structural elements above. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Other types of <b>ceiling</b> include <b>the</b> cathedral <b>ceiling,</b> <b>the</b> concave or barrel-shaped <b>ceiling,</b> <b>the</b> stretched <b>ceiling</b> and <b>the</b> coffered <b>ceiling.</b> Coving often links <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> to <b>the</b> surrounding walls. <b>Ceilings</b> can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings.|$|R
40|$|This article closely {{examines}} the unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule. Congress and partnership tax experts historically have assumed perfect unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule on liquidation or {{sale of a}} partnership interest. However, this assumption glosses over a significantly more complicated reality. This article closely {{examines the}} history of section 704 (c) and the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule and <b>the</b> rules regarding sales and liquidations of partnership interests to reveal {{the extent to which}} the assumption does not hold. By debunking long-held assumptions about the perfect unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule, this article displays that there is no reasonable justification to maintain <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule, or <b>the</b> accompanying complexity and distortion that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rule imposes on the partnership tax system...|$|R
5|$|Materials used in {{the station}} are {{expected}} to last at least 100 years; include granite tile, ceramic tile, stainless steel panels on the walls, painted steel panels on <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> energy-efficient fluorescent lamps and LEDs, and mesh; and are supposed to conform to New York City Transit criteria, including slip-resistance. The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
40|$|Suspended t-bar {{ceilings}} {{are common}} in commercial buildings. Research has found that these ceilings are very leaky, and several problems arise from this. If the space above <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> is vented to outdoors, the entire building becomes leaky. Furthermore, if the insulation is located at <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rather than <b>the</b> roof, then <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> space will be hot (summer), and if <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> space is also vented to outdoors, then <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> space will be hot and humid. The thermal and humidity conditions of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> space {{have important implications for}} space conditioning loads, building ventilation rates, and indoor relative humidity. Conductive gains through ductwork add to loads, and various forms of uncontrolled air flow readily move air between <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> space and <b>the</b> occupied space. These factors should be considered during design and construction of commercial buildings. Best practice: locate the air and thermal boundaries of the building at the roof deck. This approach has many benefits...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{is divided}} into six bays by curved and moulded timber brackets, joined by tie rods across the room. A pressed metal ceiling rose is centred within each bay. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> also is lined with beaded boards, running diagonally where <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rakes up to the collar tie.|$|R

5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
5|$|The central aisle had {{a higher}} ceiling than the side-aisles. Light was {{provided}} by clerestory windows in {{the upper part of}} the central hall. It is also possible that an apse stood at the eastern wall of the Stoa. Josephus describes the columns as Corinthian in style and Corinthian capitals have indeed been found in excavations along the mount's southern wall, as well as reused in later Roman, Byzantine and Islamic structures. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> were ornamented with deeply cut wood-carvings while other parts of the interior were apparently covered with stucco. The southernmost row of columns was incorporated into the southern wall of the Temple mount, while the northern side opened onto the plaza in the middle of which stood the Temple. From the outside, the southern wall was distinguished from the retaining wall of the platform by a series of pilasters running along the length of the superstructure. The main entry to the Stoa from the city was via a monumental staircase which led up from the Tyropoeon Valley and then across Robinson's Arch, passing over the street and shops below.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E

40|$|The National Research Council {{recommended}} {{the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle in forensic applications of DNA testing {{on the grounds that}} <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle was believed to be "conservative," giving estimates {{greater than or equal to}} the actual genotype frequencies in the appropriate reference population. We show here that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle can fail to be conservative in a population with two subpopulations and two loci, each with two alleles at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, if there is some linkage disequilibrium between loci. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle can fail in a population with two subpopulations and a single locus with two alleles if Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium does not hold. We give explicit analytical formulas to describe when <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle fails. By showing that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle is not always mathematically reliable, this analysis gives users of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle <b>the</b> responsibility of demonstrating that it is conservative for the particular data with which it is used. Our reanalysis of VNTR data bases of the FBI provides compelling evidence of two-locus associations within three major ethnic groups (Caucasian, black, and Hispanic) in the United States, even though the loci tested are located on different chromosomes. Before <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> principle is implemented, more research should be done to determine whether it may be violated in practice...|$|R
