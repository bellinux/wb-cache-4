5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as {{did all the}} commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining {{the element of surprise}} in operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E

5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{striking}} Long Island, Gloria made its final landfall in western Connecticut near Westport, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> New England while weakening. The NHC estimated that Gloria became extratropical over Maine early by 0000 UTC on September 28. The storm continued to the northeast through Atlantic Canada passing south of Greenland on September 30. The extratropical circulation of Gloria was last noted on October 2, although the remnants later affected Europe.|$|E

5|$|Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by MercurySteam and Kojima Productions, published by Konami and released on October 5, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PC version {{was released on}} August 27, 2013. The game is a reboot of the Castlevania series. Set in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages, the story focuses on Gabriel Belmont and his quest to defeat a malevolent order known as the Lords of Shadow and resurrect his wife. The player controls Gabriel in 3D environments as he uses melee skills to defeat enemies and solves puzzles <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> a gravitational field {{than they would}} {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four years all three of the regiment's {{operational}} squadrons eventually served in Vietnam, providing invaluable close support to the infantry, particularly during the clearance of Viet Cong bunker systems. Although their value in Vietnam was originally questioned by some, they proved a powerful weapon in both offence and defence, and were responsible for limiting infantry casualties. The Centurions were able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the countryside more easily than expected and although they were vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and mines, their firepower and shock action had a decisive effect on the battlefield. The tanks {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges' {{trade with}} the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was {{extremely}} important to their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the concessions offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Dacia and {{trade with the}} Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' trade with the Pontic Steppe.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred {{displaced}} {{more than}} 50families and caused CVE$250million ($2.5million) in damage, {{mostly to the}} agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the islands with documented impacts, {{as well as the}} nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle was {{the only}} {{tropical}} storm <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the Caribbean Sea in 1986. A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September7 {{to the east of}} the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband moved across the main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September10.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands on August 15. On August 17, a weak {{area of low pressure}} developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to become better organized on August 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished on August 19, and later that day it began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early on August 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>through</b> these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
