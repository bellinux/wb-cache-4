2500|$|Researcher Susan Witt said <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> {{the primary}} {{influencer}} on the gender roles of their children. Parents, siblings, peers, and even {{teachers have been}} shown to react more positively to children engaging in sex-typical behavior and playing with sex-typical toys. This is often done through encouragement or discouragement, as well as suggestions and imitation. Additionally, sons {{are more likely to be}} reinforced for sex-typical play and discouraged from atypical play. However, it is generally not as looked down upon for females to play with toys designed [...] "for boys", an activity which has also become more common in recent years. Fathers are also more likely to reinforce typical play and discourage atypical play than mothers are. A study done by researcher Susan Witt suggests that stereotypes are oftentimes only strengthened by the environment, which perpetuates them to linger in older life.|$|E
2500|$|The 1944 Education Act (Section 36) stated <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible}} {{for the education of}} their children, [...] "by regular attendance at school or otherwise", which allows children to be educated at home.

Small but increasing numbers of parents do choose to educate their children outside the conventional school systems. Officially referred to as [...] "Elective Home Education", teaching ranges from structured homeschooling (using a school-style curriculum) to less-structured unschooling.

30|$|These {{findings}} {{are in line}} with other studies that show poor involvement of parents in children with special needs {{when it comes to their}} education. For instance, a study by Mukuria and Obiakor (2004) in Nigeria and that by Alquraini (2010) in Saudi Arabia found <b>that</b> many <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> excluded from their children’s education. HAKIELIMU (2008) also had similar observation that teachers <b>were</b> complaining <b>that</b> some <b>parents</b> of children with special educational needs were a barrier to the education of their children with disability because they abandoned their children once they were enrolled in schools. The poor turn up by <b>parents</b> <b>is</b> also consistent with a study conducted by Martinez and Young (2011) in Texas to find out whether <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> invited to and participated in the follow-up meeting to monitor their children with special needs progress. In this study, 48 % of the findings indicated <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> rarely or never invited and not surprisingly then that the remaining 56 % indicated <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> never or rarely participated in follow-up responses to intervention meetings.

2500|$|Sex {{education}} {{is still a}} debate in the United States to this day. Some parents believe that their children's school programs encourage sexual activity, and the schools {{believe that there are}} many students that don't get any sex education at home. The goal for the parents is for their children to follow their family values. Parents want the ability to teach their children what they want about sex education rather than school programs teaching them of things that certain things <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> trying to avoid. Sex education programs in schools are mainly trying to give the students a complete picture about sex and sexuality. They want students to know their bodies as well as know how to protect them and make smart decisions. In a study titled [...] "Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to reduce Teen Pregnancy" [...] showed that sex education programs in schools are having a huge impact on teen's decisions to remain abstinent or to use contraceptives if they do choose to have intercourse (1). School programs are teaching students everything they need to know about sex and sexuality and that is helping these same students {{to make their own decisions}} and to be safe no matter what they choose to do.|$|E
2500|$|Karan (Zain Khan) is a thirteen-year-old boy {{who lives}} in a {{dilapidated}} orphanage owned by a stern, uncouth warden, John [...] "Hitler" [...] Kakkad (Rajesh Khera). Karan has two dreams: one is to have parents and the other is to be a big Cricketer. His inspiration is Kapil Dev, since he has been brought up on the motivating stories of India's 1983 World Cup win by the orphanage caretaker, Bholu Dada (Sushil Parashar), a loving and a gentle old man. Karan's best friend in the orphanage is Daboo (Dieptiman Chowdhury) who often lends his gentle ears to the aspirations which Karan lives on. His dreams take a turn when one day, he lays his hands on an old cricket bat which Karan is convinced is the bat that Kapil Dev used to win the 1983 World Cup; for him, the bat becomes a magic bat. One day by a stroke of luck, the coach of the Indian cricket team spots Karan playing cricket and is highly impressed by his batting skill. At that point in town, the Indian cricket team has been going through a [...] "rough patch". Karan and his magical bat are inducted into the Indian cricket team as the opening batsman along with the captain, Varun (Rahul Bose). When Karan marches onto the pitch and wins the match for India, he soon becomes the nation's heartthrob. Although he was formerly rejected by adopting couples, he is now the most sought after kid in the country. However, Raghav (Raj Bhansali), the orphanage bully, hates him and feels that if Karan did not have the magic bat he would have never made it to the cricket team. Raghav now wants the magic bat at any cost. Karan and Varun develop a strong emotional bond deeper than fellow cricketers. Karan has no parents and Varun has parents, but is estranged with his father and does not want to accept him. Karan strongly believes <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> the best gift endowed by God and succeeds in uniting Varun with his father. At the final 5th one day match between India and Pakistan, events spiral out of control and Karan's magic bat is destroyed by Raghav. Karan is a nervous wreck, but Varun makes him realise that the bat actually never had any magic but it was in the players viz. Kapil during 1983 World Cup and now Karan himself. With Karan's help, India wins the match. After the match, Karan decides to stop playing and re-join the team when he is older. Varun and his girlfriend, Malini (Meera Vasudevan) decide to adopt Karan.|$|E

60|$|Their notions {{relating}} to the duties of parents and children differ extremely from ours. For, since the conjunction {{of male and female}} is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason they will never allow that a child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for bringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> the last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own children; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents, except cottagers and labourers, are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments of docility. These schools are of several kinds, suited to different qualities, and both sexes. They have certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of their parents, and their own capacities, as well as inclinations. I shall first say something of the male nurseries, and then of the female.|$|E
6000|$|However {{it may be}} {{with respect}} to the {{exceptional}} cases above enumerated, and perhaps some others, there can, I think, be no doubt that parents who should train their children from the beginning on the principles explained in this volume, and upon others analogous to them, would never, in any case, have to strike a blow. They would accomplish the end enjoined by the precepts of Solomon, namely, the complete subjection of their children to their authority, by improved methods not known in his day, or, at least, not so fully developed that they could then be relied upon. They who imagine <b>that</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> bound to use the rod as the instrumentality, because the Scriptures speak of the rod as the means of establishing parental authority best known in those days, instead of employing the more effective methods which the progress of improvement has developed and made available at the present day, ought, in order to be consistent, to insist on the retention of the harp in religious worship, because David enjoins it upon believers to [...] "praise the Lord with harp:" [...] to [...] "sing unto him with psaltery, and an instrument of ten strings." [...] The truth is, that what we are to look at in such injunctions is the end that is to be attained, which is, in this last case, the impressive and reverential exaltation of Almighty God in our minds by the acts of public worship; and if, with the improvements in musical instruments which have been made in modern times, we can do this more satisfactorily by employing in the place of a psaltery or a harp of ten strings an organ of ten or a hundred stops, we are bound to make the substitution. In a word, we must look at the end and not at the means, remembering that in questions of Scripture interpretation the [...] "letter killeth, the spirit maketh alive." ...|$|E
