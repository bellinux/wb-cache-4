2500|$|I {{must tell}} you... <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got {{is an attempt}} to {{substitute}} the rule of the mob for the rule of law, and it must not succeed. [...] It must not succeed. There are those who are using violence and intimidation to impose their will on others who do not want it.... The rule of law must prevail over the rule of the mob.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the idea}} of a future strong united {{independent}} Arab State... too seriously... the conditions of Arabia do not and will not {{for a very long time}} to come, lend themselves to such a thing... I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for <b>that.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to arrive at now is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them on to our side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions – whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "May we not presume, sir, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{just seen}} {{is not unlike}} that {{remarkable}} exhibition when I was pained to meet you one evening at the Alhambra?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Work? We can't be bothered. <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the Germans for." [...] (from a song) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has lost}} the body, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do with it," [...] cried Morris. [...] "He {{has lost the}} body, and the death can't be established." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Not a scandal: a misfortune. I {{will tell}} you all about it, Clym. You must not be angry, but you must listen, and you'll find <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done has been done for the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{very rare}} bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all things are {{possible}} upon the moor. Yes, I {{should not be surprised}} to learn <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{will exist}} until {{the reign of}} Jesus extends to every human heart," [...] {{returned}} Paul. [...] "It seems to me <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some right and ground to expect is, not the stoppage of all war, but the abolition of war between nations calling themselves Christian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{that nobody}} can see whether they go to sleep or no. Oh, Mrs. Giles, you mustn't pull <b>that</b> down. <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been putting up all day." ...|$|R
60|$|KNOX. Dont talk nonsense, woman: {{is this a}} {{time for}} praying? Does anybody know? <b>Thats</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to {{consider}} now. If only we can keep it dark, I don't care for anything else.|$|R
60|$|BOHUN (pouncing forward again). Stop. You're {{going to}} tell me about your feelings, Mr. Crampton. Don't: I sympathize with them; but they're not my business. Tell us exactly <b>what</b> you want: <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to get at.|$|R
60|$|We must observe <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> said of {{agriculture}} is true, with little variation, {{of the other}} occupations which it represents; of all the arts which extract materials from the globe. Mining industry, for example, usually yields an increase of produce at a more than proportional increase of expense.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, isn't <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{been trying}} to do all along?" [...] Captain Bayley exclaimed angrily. [...] "How are we {{to get to the bottom}} of it? If you will tell me that I will grant that you have more sense in your head than I have ever given you credit for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have really}} no idea, but I am sure <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got {{here and in}} the {{schooner}} must be worth some thousands of pounds. What we have left behind must be the contents of about ten vessels, as all {{we have been able}} to take is only a full cargo for one good-sized ship.” ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Cavor {{extinguished}} the light. He said <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not overmuch energy stored, and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>we</b> must economise for reading. For a time, {{whether it}} was long or short I do not know, {{there was nothing but}} blank darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "An' <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> sor; but the Irish pipes are soft, mellow, gentle things--like the Irish girls--not {{like them}} big Scotch bellows that screech {{for all the}} world like a {{thousand}} unwillin' pigs bein' forced to go to markit." ...|$|R
5000|$|Raaz {{says that}} [...] "It {{is a very}} {{emotional}} film" [...] for him and that [...] "It is a very innocent story."

60|$|But {{you must}} not fancy, good reader, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{described}} is given as a specimen {{of the extent to}} which the slave-trade on that coast is carried. It is but as a specimen of the manner thereof. It is certainly within the mark to say that at least thirty thousand natives are annually carried away as slaves from the east coast of Africa.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{let it be}} {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here supposed is not imaginary--it is not even of rare occurrence. It happens every year. Last year thirty-eight ships were thus saved by lifeboats. The year before, twenty-eight were saved. The year before that, seventeen. Before that, twenty-one. As surely and regularly as the year comes round, so surely and regularly are ships and property thus saved to the nation.|$|E
6000|$|Not by its fault--but thine: Our outward sense [...] Is but of gradual grasp--and {{as it is}} [...] <b>That</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{of feeling}} most intense [...] Outstrips our faint expression; e'en so this [...] Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice [...] Fools our fond gaze, and {{greatest}} of the great [...] Defies at first our nature's littleness, [...] Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate Our spirits {{to the size of}} that they contemplate.|$|E
60|$|CENTURION. Silence! Silen-n-n-n-nce! Where's your behavior? Is {{that the}} way to listen to an officer? (To the Captain) <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to put up with from these Christians every day, sir. They're always {{laughing}} and joking something scandalous. They've no religion: that's how it is.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Our Differences is {{the tenth}} studio album by the Indigo Girls, {{released}} in 2006. The title {{is drawn from}} third track, [...] "I Believe in Love" [...] (I still believe despite our differences <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have's</b> enough/And I believe in you and I believe in love).|$|R
6000|$|In a talk I {{had with}} a gipsy a short time ago, he said to me: [...] "You know what the books say, and we don't. But we know {{other things that are}} not in the books, and <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have.</b> It's ours, our own, and you can't know it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{pass over}} those {{conditions}} {{which are the}} most obvious, that the building should be sound and dry, the apartment airy, and with abundant light. And I dispose with a passing anathema of all such as would endeavour to solve their problem, or at any rate compromise their difficulties, by setting one row of books in front of another. I also freely admit <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> before us is not a choice between difficulty and no difficulty, but a choice among difficulties.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it appears}} to us <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here, for illustration's sake, {{supposed}} {{to be done with}} the watch, is exactly what the establishment of Darwin's Theory will do for the organic world. For the notion that every organism has been created as it is and launched straight at a purpose, Mr. Darwin substitutes the conception of something which may fairly be termed a method of trial and error. Organisms vary incessantly; of these variations the few meet with surrounding conditions which suit them and thrive; the many are unsuited and become extinguished.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{itself that}} is bad enough. Too bad, indeed--Ventregris!--too bad. Yet Fate is not content. It must occur {{to this woman}} to select me--me of all men--to journey into Dauphiny, and release another woman from the {{clutches}} of yet a third. And to what shifts are we not put, to what discomforts not subjected? You know them, Rabecque, for you have shared them with me. But it begins to break upon my mind <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> endured may be as nothing to what may lie before us. It is an ill thing {{to have to do}} with women. Yet you, Rabecque, would have deserted me for one of them!" ...|$|E

"When He became incarnate and {{was made}} man, He {{commenced}} afresh {{the long line}} of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lost in Adam—namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus." ...|$|R
5000|$|Well, that's about it. <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> and <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> owe. It isn't {{very much}} but Pat and I have the {{satisfaction}} that every dime that we've got is honestly ours. I should say this—that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But {{she does have}} a respectable Republican cloth coat. And I always tell her that she'd look good in anything.|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear friend," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is nothing}} to be done, so calm yourself, and let things take their course. It has been folly on my part to shelter myself behind mere {{barriers}} of wood and stone. The fact is, that inaction was terrible to me, and I felt that to do anything, however futile, in the nature of a precaution, was better than passive resignation. My humble friend here and I have placed ourselves in a position in which, I trust, no poor fellow will ever find himself again. We can only recommend ourselves to the unfailing goodness of the Almighty, and trust <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> endured in this world may lessen our atonement in the world to come. I must leave you now, for I have many papers to destroy and much to arrange. Good-bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|I only pause on this {{parenthesis}} to show that, even {{in matters}} admittedly within its range, popular science goes {{a great deal}} too fast, and drops enormous links of logic. Nevertheless, it remains the working reality <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to deal with in}} the case of children is, for all practical purposes, environment; or, to use the older word, education. When all such deductions are made, education is at least a form of will-worship; not of cowardly fact-worship; it deals with a department that we can control; it does not merely darken us with the barbarian pessimism of Zola and the heredity-hunt. We shall certainly make fools of ourselves; that is what is meant by philosophy. But we shall not merely make beasts of ourselves; which is the nearest popular definition for merely following the laws of Nature and cowering under the vengeance of the flesh. Education contains much moonshine; but not of the sort that makes mere mooncalves and idiots the slaves of a silver magnet, the one eye of the world. In this decent arena there are fads, but not frenzies. Doubtless we shall often find a mare's nest; but it will not always be the nightmare's.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a fourth class of people who take {{whatever}} it is that they happen to want, and say that that is the ultimate aim of evolution. And these are the only sensible people. This is the only really healthy way with the word evolution, to work for what you want, and to call THAT evolution. The only intelligible sense that progress or advance can have among men, {{is that we have a}} definite vision, and that we wish to make the whole world like that vision. If you like to put it so, the essence of the doctrine is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> around us is the mere method and preparation for something that we have to create. This is not a world, but rather the material for a world. God has given us not so much the colours of a picture as the colours of a palette. But he has also given us a subject, a model, a fixed vision. We must be clear about what we want to paint. This adds a further principle to our previous list of principles. We have said we must be fond of this world, even in order to change it. We now add that we must be fond of another world (real or imaginary) in order to have something to change it to.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus writes:"When He became incarnate and {{was made}} man, He {{commenced}} afresh {{the long line}} of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lost in Adam - namely to be according to the image and likeness of God- that we might recover in Christ Jesus." ...|$|R
