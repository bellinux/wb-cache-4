5|$|On May 12, 2014, Whitlock {{was signed}} as an undrafted free agent with the Cincinnati Bengals. Upon signing with the Bengals, Whitlock was moved from {{defensive}} tackle to fullback. At 5'10", , Whitlock was considered <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> play defensive tackle at the NFL level.|$|E

5|$|While some list S.scutellata as inedible, others list it {{as having}} an unknown edibility. David Arora {{considers}} it <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be of any culinary interest, and it lacks a distinctive smell or taste.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of their land, local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|Created and {{expanded}} {{from the core}} troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards, the central field armies by 295AD {{seem to have been}} too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.|$|E

5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission is achieved, leukemic cells likely remain in numbers <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy {{is necessary to}} eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that is, to achieve a cure.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium. The discovery of plutonium {{had to wait until}} the end of 1940, when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium-238.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E

50|$|Gawler Belt is a {{locality}} {{to the northwest}} of Gawler in South Australia. The area is predominantly rural in character, {{although most of the}} area is now <b>too</b> <b>small</b> allotments <b>to</b> farm profitably, so it is essentially a rural and industrial suburb of Gawler.|$|R
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely {{not strong enough to}} break human skin.|$|E
5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at {{the eastern end of}} a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} over by 4:00p.m. in a {{crushing}} victory for Li Yuan, who then led his troops against Huoyi itself. Although he lacked any siege equipment, the garrison {{in the town}} was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> effectively resist Li Yuan's army, and Huoyi fell within a few hours.|$|E

5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The insects {{captured}} by the glandular trichomes are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> serve any role in pollination. It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. This fleet, {{even if it had}} been in British hands, was <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> transport the large British army to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

50|$|Even {{after all}} the {{improvement}} in the recent two decades the place is not free of the usual problems with Howrah. The amount of road space to the population in Howrah is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> compared <b>to</b> even <b>smaller</b> towns by populations like Berhampur. The same problem applies to Kadamtala too.|$|R
5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> sustain a population.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species are <b>too</b> <b>small</b> <b>to</b> pose {{much of a}} risk to humans, {{and only a few}} fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
50|$|Aquariums may be {{decorated}} with sand or gravel, live or plastic plants, driftwood, rocks, {{and a variety}} of commercially made plastic sculptures. The smallest aquariums are fish bowls, but these are not recommended for most fish as they are generally <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> tend <b>to</b> stunt fish growth, and may lead to eventual death.|$|R

However, when the Commodore chose Cardinham to {{evaluate}} the capability of streaming sweeps in moderately rough conditions, {{it was decided that}} the sweepers were <b>too</b> <b>small</b> actually <b>to</b> go to Suez, which was much regretted. They were intended to clear the canal before heavy ships cleared the area.|$|R
