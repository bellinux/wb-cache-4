5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Takechi <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stage to the cinema. Though the {{mainstream}} film industry considered Takechi an amateur and an outsider, {{he would continue}} to produce ground-breaking films sporadically {{for the rest of his}} life. Some of the innovations and trends in Japanese erotic cinema which Takechi's films pioneered include big-budgets and releases, literary and artistic aspirations, fogging, political themes, and theatrical hardcore.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on the brake run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E

5|$|When {{the motion}} of Juliette turned to the northeast, some {{computer}} models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch as a precautionary measure for portions of the state. When the storm weakened rapidly and <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast, the watch was canceled. Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, {{and as a result}} there were no reports of damage or deaths. In southern California, however, the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions. These waves wiped out a fishing derby. The remnants of Hurricane Juliette moved into New Mexico and western Texas, producing scattered showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

25|$|Capirossi {{returned}} to the 500cc championship for 2000, and remained there through its evolution to the 990cc and eventually, 800cc four-stroke MotoGP era. He won at his home race and finished 7th overall, one point behind Carlos Checa. The 2001 season {{was better than the}} year before, although without a win during the year. Also it was the last season for the 500cc class, but for the 2002 season Capirossi found that he would ride inferior bikes from 2001. It was a less competitive year, hampered by a wrist injury in the seventh race of the season when he missed the chicane and <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> track. He was not given access to Honda's four-stroke machine in late 2002 when teammate Alex Barros was, as he was already to leave the team.|$|E
25|$|Beer Street and Gin Lane {{with their}} {{depictions of the}} {{deprivation}} of the wasted gin-drinkers and the corpulent good health of the beer-drinkers, owe a debt to Pieter Bruegel the Elder's La Maigre Cuisine and La Grasse Cuisine engraved by Pieter van der Heyden in 1563, which shows two meals, one of which overflows with food and is populated by fat diners, while in the other the emaciated guests squabble over a few meagre scraps. Brueghel's compositions are also mirrored in the layers of detail in Hogarth's two images. Inspiration for these two prints and The Four Stages of Cruelty probably came from his friend Fielding: Hogarth <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> satirical wit of Marriage à-la-mode in favour of a more cutting examination of crime and punishment with these prints and Industry and Idleness {{at the same time}} that Fielding was approaching the subject in literature. Paulson thinks it likely that they planned the literature and the imagery together as a campaign.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie {{spent his}} last {{years as a}} philanthropist. From 1901 forward, public {{attention}} was <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited {{way in which he}} devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in Triumphant Democracy (1886) and Gospel of Wealth (1889). Carnegie bought Skibo Castle in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his New York mansion located at 2 East 91st Street at Fifth Avenue. The building was built in 1903 and he lived there until his death in 1919. His wife Louise also lived there until her death in 1946. The building is now the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side has come to be called Carnegie Hill. The mansion was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 1688, Leopold I's forces {{under the}} Elector of Bavaria secured Belgrade for the Empire. With the Ottomans {{appearing}} close to collapse Louis XIV's ministers, Louvois and Colbert de Croissy, felt it essential {{to have a}} quick resolution along the German frontier before the Emperor <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Balkans to lead a comparatively united German Empire against France on the Rhine and reverse the Ratisbon settlement. On 24 September Louis published his manifesto, his Mémoire de raisons, listing his grievances: he demanded that the Truce of Ratisbon {{be turned into a}} permanent resolution, and that Fürstenburg be appointed Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis's control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands 'buffer-zone' would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies could have known its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to investing Philippsburg, the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns. This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.|$|E

500|$|Andrade was not {{directly}} affected by the Revolution of 1930, in which Getúlio Vargas seized power and became dictator, but he belonged to the landed class the Revolution was designed to displace, and his employment prospects declined under the Vargas regime. [...] He was able to remain at the Conservatory, where he was now Chair of History of Music and Aesthetics. [...] With this title he became a de facto national authority {{on the history of}} music, and his research <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> personal bent of his 1920s work to textbooks and chronologies. [...] He continued to document rural folk music, and during the 1930s made an enormous collection of recordings of the songs and other forms of music of the interior. [...] The recordings were exhaustive, with a selection based on comprehensiveness rather than an aesthetic judgment, and including context, related folktalkes, and other non-musical sound. [...] Andrade's techniques were influential in the development of ethnomusicology in Brazil and predate similar work done elsewhere, including the well-known recordings of Alan Lomax. [...] He is credited with coining the word [...] "popularesque," [...] which he defined as imitations of Brazilian folk music by erudite urban musicians ("erudite" [...] is generally a deprecation in Andrade's vocabulary). The word continues to have currency in discussion of Brazilian music as both a scholarly and nationalist category.|$|E

2500|$|Interest in pagan traditions {{was first}} revived during the Renaissance, when Renaissance magic was practiced as {{a revival of}} Greco-Roman magic.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her rigorous exercise routines Elisabeth practised {{what could be called}} a true beauty cult, but one that was highly ascetic, solitary, and prone to bizarre, eccentric, and almost mystic routines. Daily care of her abundant and extremely long hair, which in time <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dark blonde of her youth to chestnut brunette, took at least three hours. Her hair was so long and heavy that she often complained that the weight of the elaborate double braids and pins gave her headaches. Her hairdresser, Franziska Feifalik, was originally a stage hairdresser at the Wiener Burgtheater. Responsible for all of Elisabeth's ornate hairstyles, she always accompanied her on her wanderings. Feifalik was forbidden to wear rings and required to wear white gloves; after hours of dressing, braiding, and pinning up the Empress' tresses, the hairs that fell out had to be presented in a silver bowl to her reproachful empress for inspection. When her hair was washed with special [...] "essences" [...] of eggs and cognac once every two weeks, all activities and obligations were cancelled for that day. Before her son's death, she tasked Feifalik with tweezing gray hairs away, {{but at the end of}} her life her hair was described as [...] "abundant, though streaked with silver threads." ...|$|E
2500|$|The varied song {{selection}} {{allowed the}} band {{to create a}} [...] "rotation" [...] of songs that was roughly repeated every 3 to 5 performances ("shows"). [...] The rotation created two phenomena. The first was that the desire of Deadheads to hear their favorite song or attend a good show led many of them to begin following the band on its tour. [...] The second was that {{the large number of}} traveling fans empowered the band to perform multiple shows in each venue with the assurance that the performances would be mostly sold out, as almost all were from the mid [...] 1980s on. In this way, the Deadheads were one of the main driving forces keeping the band going. [...] With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed out of the familiarity. As generations <b>turned</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Acid Tests to the 1970s (and onward), tours became a time to revel with friends at concerts, old and new, who never knew the psychedelic age that spawned the band they loved.
