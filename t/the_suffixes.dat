5|$|The Nahuatl verb {{is quite}} complex and inflects for many {{grammatical}} categories. The verb {{is composed of}} a root, prefixes, and suffixes.

5000|$|There are two {{deletion}} {{processes that}} occur with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> /-li/. If <b>the</b> verbal <b>suffix</b> /-li/ precedes <b>the</b> verbal <b>suffix</b> /-tʃi/, <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> /-li/ may be deleted if the resulting syllable, after deletion, is a consonant cluster. The other process occurs when <b>the</b> verbal <b>suffix</b> /-li/ precedes <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> /-t/, which results with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> /-li/ being sometimes deleted if the syllable /-li/ has not already gone under phonological processes as described above.|$|R

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while <b>the</b> <b>suffixes</b> indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E
5|$|Modern Mongolian is an agglutinative, almost {{exclusively}} suffixing language, {{the only exception}} being reduplication. Most of <b>the</b> <b>suffixes</b> consist of a single morpheme. There are many derivational morphemes. For example, the word bajguullagynh consists of the root baj- 'to be', an epenthetic -g-, the causative -uul- (hence 'to found'), the derivative suffix -laga that forms nouns created by the action (like -ation in 'organisation') and the complex suffix –ynh denoting something that belongs to the modified word (-yn would be genitive).|$|E

40|$|The {{second person}} {{singular}} pronoun in Middle Dutch was du. The pronoun du combined with finite verbs ending in <b>the</b> <b>suffixs.</b> Both <b>the</b> pronoun du and <b>the</b> <b>suffixs</b> are lost in Modern Dutch. The {{loss of the}} pronoun and <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> is related: there is no variant of Dutch that has a suffix s that does not also have the pronoun du or vice versa. The question is how we should understand this combined loss of the pronoun and <b>the</b> <b>suffix.</b> <b>The</b> central claim in this book is that the decrease {{in the use of}} the pronoun du (combining with <b>the</b> <b>suffixs)</b> is driven by politeness. The plural and polite pronoun gi (combining with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> t) came to be used in an increasing number of contexts. Although we can understand the decrease of the pronoun du and <b>the</b> <b>suffixs</b> as <b>the</b> result of politeness, the loss of both the pronoun and <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> is driven by inflectional economy. <b>The</b> <b>suffix</b> that <b>the</b> pronoun gi combined with was more economical than <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> that du combined with. This claim is supported by data on synchronic and diachronic variation in Dutch. This study is of interest to scholars working in the field of historical linguistics, corpus linguistics, pragmatics and inflectional morphology...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>suffixes</b> ‑o, ‑a, ‑e, and ‑i {{indicate}} that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively.

25|$|Multipliers/reversers — The two multipliers/reversers are {{comparatively}} less {{productive and}} are not obligatory.

25|$|Like {{in other}} Germanic languages, the {{conjugation}} of verb tenses {{is divided into}} two groups: The first group, the so-called weak verbs, indicates the past tense by adding <b>the</b> <b>suffixes</b> -ede or -te. The second, called strong verbs, forms the past tense with a zero ending and, in most cases, certain vowel changes.|$|E
25|$|Adjectival names {{very often}} end in <b>the</b> <b>suffixes,</b> -ski, -cki and -dzki (feminine -ska, -cka and -dzka), and are {{considered}} to be either typically Polish or typical for the Polish nobility.

25|$|The plurals {{of human}} and {{non-human}} nouns differed; non-human nouns took the suffix ಗಳ್ whilst human nouns took the suffix ಅರ್. These two suffixes had tens and tens of varied forms. Occasionally, with human nouns and nouns normally taking only ಅರ್, double plurals were formed using both <b>the</b> <b>suffixes</b> e.g. ಜನ (person) + ಅರ್ + ಗಳ್ = ಜನರ್ಗಳ್ (people).|$|E
25|$|Parks, large {{businesses}} such as shopping centres, and big houses, {{may have}} more than one entrance and more than one delivery point.

40|$|The {{substring}} traversal {{problem is}} the problem of enumerating all branching substrings appearing in a given text. Although this problem is easily solvable with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> tree of McCreight (1976), a space efficient and practically fast solution is important. We devise a simple and efficient algorithm that simulates the traversal of <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> tree for a given text with the suJfix' arra!l of Manbet and Meyers (1993) and Gonnet, Baeza-Yates, Snider (1992) The algorithm runs in O(n) time and 5 bulk I/O with - <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> array and an additional structure called the height arra!l, while the naive algorithm using binary search on <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> array requires O(n 2) time in the worst case. The space requirement 7 N bytes of our algorithm is smaller than 15 N bytes of the traversal algorithm with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> tree. A linear time algerthru for computing the height array from <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> and <b>the</b> height arrays is also presented. Computer experiments on real datasets showed that our traversal algorithm with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> array is an order of magnitude faster than the naive simulation method and comparable to the traversal algorithm with <b>the</b> <b>suffix</b> tree...|$|R
