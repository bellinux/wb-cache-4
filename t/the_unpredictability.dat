5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of {{the show}} and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

40|$|In Epic Reinvented, Mary Ellis Gibson {{examines}} Ezra Pound's Cantos {{to trace}} connections between his aesthetics and his politics. She treats little-known and unpublished writings, including many early poems. One substantial poem, "In Praise of the Masters," appears here in print {{for the first}} time. Discussing Pound's relationship to his Victorian predecessors, particularly Robert Browning and nineteenth-century historians, Gibson demonstrates how Pound's attempt to write a post-Romantic epic both confronted questions of genre and social order and led to <b>the</b> <b>unpredictabilities</b> of his politics. She develops a rhetorical tropology {{to account for the}} formal and cultural dimensions of Pound's contradictions. Exploring fin-de-siecle publishing, Gibson investigates how Pound's utopian political vision was rooted in nineteenth-century and fascist ideologies of gender. Violence is implicit in both. For Gibson, the aesthetic Pound and the political Pound, Pound the visionary and Pound the historian, are one...|$|R

25|$|Masi {{served as}} the Braves' backup catcher first to Al López, then Ray Berres, and finally to Ernie Lombardi. He began to develop his {{reputation}} as a good defensive catcher from his association with knuckleball pitcher Jim Tobin. The other Braves catchers shunned Tobin due to <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the notoriously difficult to catch knuckleball and, Masi took over the job as his catcher. When Lombardi was traded to the New York Giants in 1943, Masi became the Braves regular catcher.

His 1688 book Confusion of Confusions explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about stock trading, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.|$|E
25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists {{worked very hard to}} strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E

25|$|Seam bowlers {{can get a}} lot of {{help from}} certain types of pitches. Hard pitches that have a cracked or ridged surface are best for seam bowling since the {{hardness}} makes it easier to bounce the ball without losing speed while the uneven surface adds to <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the bounce when the ball hits the pitch. This is known as variable bounce. On rare occasions, an extremely hard and uneven pitch is declared too dangerous to play on, since the batsman cannot predict the ball, and are likely to be hit as a result. Green pitches can also assist the seam bowler since the tiny tufts of grass represent an uneven surface although this is a mixed blessing since the green surface also slows the ball slightly. It is difficult for a seam bowler to be effective on a very flat and even-surfaced pitch (known as a flat track in cricket vernacular) and seamers usually resort to aggressive bowling tactics and/or bowling cutters on such surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was once}} thought by {{scientists}} that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that nervous systems are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to chaos theory. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of free will given various possible reactions to {{the problem in the}} first place. Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of libertarian free will, by making arguments based on generative processes (emergence). Other proponents of emergentist or generative philosophy, cognitive sciences and evolutionary psychology, argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true. They suggest instead that an illusion of free will is experienced due to the generation of infinite behaviour from the interaction of finite-deterministic set of s and parameters. Thus <b>the</b> <b>unpredictability</b> of the emerging behaviour from deterministic processes leads to a perception of free will, even though free will as an ontological entity does not exist. Certain experiments looking at the neuroscience of free will can be said to support this possibility.|$|E
