5|$|The {{desert is}} {{generally}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> barren and empty landscape. It has been portrayed by writers, film-makers, philosophers, artists and critics {{as a place}} of extremes, a metaphor for anything from death, war or religion to the primitive past or the desolate future.|$|E
5|$|General homomorphisms {{can also}} be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of coloring: if the {{vertices}} of a fixed graph H are the available colors and edges of H describe which colors are compatible, then an H-coloring of G is an assignment of colors to vertices of G such that adjacent vertices get compatible colors.|$|E

Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. Phillips and Lloyd were <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them could drop goals, and were remarkable in their kicks to touch.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general haven of reform movements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} semantics of a sequent is an assertion that whenever every [...] is true, {{at least one}} [...] will also be true. Thus the empty sequent, having both cedents empty, is false. One way to express this is that a comma {{to the left of}} the turnstile should be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> [...] "and", and a comma to the right of the turnstile should be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> (inclusive) [...] "or".

5|$|<b>Thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} {{candidate for the}} American League Rookie of the Year Award, at this point Baseball America rated Hammonds the third best prospect in all of baseball. Hammonds suffered a knee injury during the 1994 season but opted to continue playing despite being told he needed reconstructive knee surgery, with his subsequent performances limited as a result. When the Orioles needed to reduce their roster from 28 players to 25 in May 1995, Hammonds, who started the season batting 4-for-19, was optioned back to Bowie.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> disorder of the child's personality or a distortion {{of the relationship between}} the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for {{his lack}} of {{confidence}} in him. Despite this outburst, Nani was given a chance to shine and provided an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in another good performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was first <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel. Following this performance, Nani then set up the second of a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Montreal-based {{publisher}} Drawn and Quarterly {{began with}} an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly. It quickly picked up {{a number of other}} titles, such as Julie Doucet's semi-autobiographical, bilingual Dirty Plotte, which, like Yummy Fur, had started out as a minicomic; Seth's Palookaville; illegal resident from the US Joe Matt's Peepshow; and Yummy Fur, which made the jump with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an autobiographical comics trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Toronto comics rat pack, depicting one another in their comics and doing signings and interviews together.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Bayreuth canon {{consists}} of those operas by the German composer Richard Wagner (1813–1883) {{that have been}} performed at the Bayreuth Festival. The festival, which {{is dedicated to the}} staging of these works, was founded by Wagner in 1876 in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth, and has continued under the directorship of his family since his death. Although it was not originally held annually, it has taken place in July and August every year since the 75th anniversary season in 1951. Its venue is the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which was built for the first festival. Attendance at the festival is often <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage made by Wagner aficionados.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Sellers {{appeared in a}} further three television series based on The Goons, which aired on Britain's new ITV channel. The series were The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's The Smallest Show on Earth, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The Man Who Never Was. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued to be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has evolved}} from {{historical}} routes, {{some of which are}} thousands of years old including the Harrow Way and the Fosse Way. The modern route was first laid out in the early 19th century as the New Direct Road, a faster coaching route from London to Exeter. It was initially in demand but fell into disuse as railways became popular from the 1840s onwards. It was not <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> significant through route when roads were initially numbered, but was revived as a major road in 1933, eventually becoming a trunk road in 1958. Since then, the A303 has gradually been upgraded to modern standards, though there are still several unimproved parts.|$|E
