5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the series}} {{to include a}} part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The {{extent to which it}} is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Volunteer Corps' {{activity}} was only revived after the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

In 1923, Lăzărel paraded it at the Volunteers' Union reunion in Arad. Referred to as the Darnița Banner, it was donated to a local church, then exhibited by the Museum of Banat, Timișoara. The Kishinev flag was donated by the Corps to ASTRA National Museum Complex of Sibiu.|$|E

5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
