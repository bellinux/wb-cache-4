5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev invented <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> illustrate recurring ("periodic") {{trends in the}} properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as new elements have been discovered, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} was on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, {{which was used}} to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

5|$|Central Coast Mariners Football Club is an Australian {{professional}} soccer club {{based in}} Gosford, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It competes in the A-League, under licence from Football Federation Australia (FFA). The Mariners {{was founded in}} 2004 {{as one of the}} eight original A-League teams. It was the first professional sports club from the Gosford region to compete in a national competition. Despite being considered one of the smallest-market clubs in the league, Central Coast Mariners has claimed one A-League Championship from four Grand Final appearances and topped <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> win the A-League Premiership twice. The club has also appeared in the AFC Champions League four times.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> {{the right}} lists the {{critical}} masses for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30cm of steel), the critical {{masses of the}} odd isotopes are about 3–4kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59gram for 245Cm, 155gram for 243Cm and 1550gram for 247Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually of the order 20%, the values for 242Cm and 246Cm were listed as large as 371kg and 70.1kg, respectively, by some research groups.|$|E
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps {{by the side of the}} hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E

5|$|League {{football}} was suspended in September 1939 with {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, and team affairs in wartime competitions were handled by director and acting manager Arthur Wright, before his resignation from illness midway through the 1942–43 season. He was replaced by Tom Lockie, who carried on until after the 1945–46 FA Cup, when Mitchell returned for the 1946–47 Football League season. Mitchell resigned in February 1950 to concentrate on his business interests, and was succeeded in April by Birmingham City northern scout and former York player Dick Duckworth. He lifted the club from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> a top four position, but left in October 1952 to take over at Stockport County. Former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer took over in November 1952, but his health declined and died in February 1953, after less than three months in charge. Sheffield United assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, before he resigned in September 1954 over a dispute with the board regarding team selection. York went the next 18 months without an official manager, with team matters handled by trainer Lockie and secretary Sherrington. This was a successful period for the club; York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and were beaten by Newcastle United in a replay.|$|E
5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|When Westley {{took over}} the Hertfordshire club, Stevenage were sitting 21st in the Football Conference, and were six points adrift of safety. Unlike his {{position}} at his previous club, Westley was appointed as first-team manager, with no board involvement. He set about ensuring the club {{were still in the}} highest tier in non-league football, signing seven players from his previous club Farnborough, as well as his former assistant Graham Pearce and goalkeeping coach Graham Benstead. His first game in charge of the club was a 1–1 draw at home to Morecambe, before having to wait three games for his first win at the club – a 2–0 victory away at local rivals Barnet, thanks to a Dino Maamria brace. The victory sparked an eight-game unbeaten run, recording six victories on the bounce to ensure the club were safe from relegation. Westley had guided the club from 21st in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> a respectable 12th-place finish {{by the end of the}} season. The 2003–04 season witnessed a much more consistent season under Westley's management, but the club were unable to make the play-offs and finished the campaign in 8th place, despite a positive start to the season.|$|E
