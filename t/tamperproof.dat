Our novel <b>tamperproofing</b> method is based on transforming numeric or non-numeric constant values in the text of the watermarked program into function calls whose value depends on the watermark data structure. Under reasonable assumptions about the knowledge and resources of an attacker, we argue that no attacker can be certain that they have altered our <b>tamperproofed</b> watermark unless they take a risk of affecting program correctness in some way that may be difficult to detect.

40|$|Apps repackaged through reverse {{engineering}} pose a significant security {{threat to the}} Android smart phone ecosystem. Previous solutions have mostly focused on the detection and identification of repackaged apps. Nevertheless, current app anti-repackaging services can only protect applications at a coarse level and have significant performance overhead. These approaches can neither meet the performance requirements of Android nor achieve fine-grained protection against cumulative attack at the same time. Specifically, these solutions rely on a fix-structure detecting engine and then will execute the same path at different times, which lead to the whole protection performs poorly when faced with dynamic cumulative attack, which is typical in real-world attack. This paper introduces the AppIS, a reinforced antirepackaging immune system, that is robust to app-repackaging attack scenarios. Unlike past work, which mostly focuses on simple protection only from just one respect, our design exploits an interlocking guarding net with time diversity for the <b>tamperproofing</b> of Android applications. The intuition underlying our design is that a dynamic and static combining method can provide a multi-level protection for the codes, core algorithm and sensitive data. We analyze and classify the existing threats on Android platform and furthermore abstract then model the repackaging attack scenarios. We then adapt a random controller used by the dispatcher to randomly construct guarding net with different structure every time. We have built a prototype of our design using Java Native Interface cross-layer calling mechanism for performance requirement. Results from a deployment of AppIS on three kinds of popular apps demonstrate that the new design can prevent our apps from cumulative attack without extra performance cost...|$|R

Due to a retail landscape consisting of large stores, displaying packed products on the shelves in self-service environments, these aspects become increasingly important, not only for Fast Moving Consumer Goods, but for consumer durables as well. In the communication aspect, the package delivers a promise to the customer contained in the package, but the package itself is part of this promise, creating expectation to be fulfilled when reaching for the product, the importance opportunity of this brief moment is shown throughout this paper. However, selling expensive consumer durables in self-service retail environments also brings with it the need for <b>tamperproof</b> packaging. The objective of <b>tamperproof</b> packaging is to prevent opening of the packaging by shoppers while in the store, in order to prevent theft or damage. However, <b>tamperproof</b> packaging makes it also difficult for the legitimate buyer to get to his new purchase. This conflicts with the positive message the packaging tries to communicate.
