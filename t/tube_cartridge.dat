Processing is performed by translating the furnace with the sample in a stationary position to minimize any disturbances to the solid/liquid interface front during steady state processing. Typical sample materials for this metals and alloys furnace are lead-tin alloys, lead-antimony alloys, and aluminum alloys.

These cartridges consist mainly of an alloy of 60 weight percent molybdenum with 40 weight percent rhenium, made from molybdenum powder coated with rhenium. This alloy was selected because of its high melting temperature (approximately equal. 2, 550 C) and because of its excellent ductility at room temperature.

The MSL safety concept requires that experiment samples containing toxic compounds are contained in SCAs that support the detection of potential leaks. The volume between the experiment sample and the <b>cartridge</b> <b>tube</b> is filled with a pre-defined quantity of krypton, allowing leak detection by mass spectrometry.

5000|$|The {{design for}} a magazine-fed, {{lever-operated}} rifle chambered for the [...]56-56 Spencer rimfire cartridge was completed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. Called the Spencer Repeating Rifle, it was fired by cocking a lever to extract a used case and feed a new <b>cartridge</b> from a <b>tube</b> in the buttstock. Like most firearms of the time, the hammer had to be manually cocked in a separate action before the weapon could be fired. The weapon used copper rimfire cartridges based on the 1854 Smith & Wesson patent stored in a seven-round tube magazine. A spring in the tube enabled the rounds to be fired one after another. When empty, the spring had to be released and removed before dropping in fresh cartridges, then replaced before resuming firing. Rounds could be loaded individually or from a device called the Blakeslee Cartridge Box, which contained up to thirteen (also six and ten) <b>tubes</b> with seven <b>cartridges</b> each, which could be emptied into the magazine tube in the buttstock.|$|R

VOC were dynamically sampled in custom packed glass multi-sorbent <b>cartridge</b> <b>tubes</b> (Carbotrap, Carbopack X and Carboxen 569). A modified Tedlar® gas sampling bag was placed in vivo covering the inflorescence of the studied orchid, a design that prevents the dilution of the VOC mixture emitted by the flower.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{quantify}} the Ibuprofen sodium salt in samples derived from Franz cells transdermal delivery experiments. An analytical method for a determination of Ibuprofen sodium salt and Diclofenac sodium salt (used as internal standard) has been developed, assuring rapidity, accuracy, precision, selectivity and a minimal treatment of the sample. With this method {{we have been able}} to analized not only the sample obtained from the recipient cell, but also the skin and the formulation used in the experiment. To this aim a methods that would allow the easy removal of the drug from the tissue has been developped. In this way, it was easy to verify the real quantification of the drug in all phases of the experiment and quantify its total delivery. In order to perform High Performance Liquid Cromatography (HPLC) analysis, human skin used in experiment has been dissolved first and then deproteinized. The effectiveness of deproteinization performed through methods such as precipitation with organic solvent, cryo-treatment, Amicon filter <b>tubes,</b> HybridSpe <b>cartridges</b> and Folch method has been verified through the use of the NanoOrange kit. For the HPLC method, the working conditions were as follows: RP 18 column EC 150 / 4, 6 NUCLEODUR® 100 - 5 C 18 ec, Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} a commercially available activated carbon filter for VOC removal from air through the analysis of real samples. The filter was tested for VOC reduction efficiencies in a PVC portable inflatable bubble provided with an air purifier system called Airbox II Phase by Zonair 3 d, as described hereinafter. The filter was placed in the Airbox II Phase of the bubble, between a pre-filter and a particulate HEPA H 14 filter. Simultaneous duplicate samples were taken from the input air duct before the driving system and from the bubble. VOC were dynamically sampled during 2 -h control periods by connecting custom packed glass multi-sorbent <b>cartridge</b> <b>tubes</b> (Carbotrap, Carbopack X and Carboxen 569) to air pump samplers. A validated analytical method based on TD-GC/MS was used to quantify a wide variety of VOC families (alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, halocarbons, aldehydes, esters, terpenes, ethers, glycols and nitrogenated compounds). VOC family removal efficiencies ranged from 51 ± 19 % to 78 ± 22 % with input indoor air, and from 42 ± 16 % to 91 ± 18 % with input outdoor air. No significant differences in reduction efficiencies (t-test; p < 0. 05) were observed between using indoor or outdoor air. Several aldehydes were desorbed from the filter at low concentrations (0. 09 – 21. 19 μg m− 3) when outdoor air was used as input air. Ozone removal efficiency was assessed by a continuous monitoring system. A 100 % yield was obtained in all cases where ozone was present. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

Molecular genetic testing allows one to analyze the genetic structure of an organism to have an idea about the present temporary or hereditary characteristics of the tissue or the whole organism, or specifically define its species. In order to analyze the genetic structure, one must extract and isolate the nucleic acids (NA), which are most of the time inside the cell. The aim of this thesis study is to design and manufacture an automated device with low throughput DNA extraction. Currently, the automated devices used for extraction of genetic material are being manufactured only by the foreign companies. Automated commercial devices used for this purpose were investigated in detail as well as the manual NA extraction hand tools for use in NA extraction. Commercially available components (pipette tip, reagent <b>cartridges,</b> <b>tubes,</b> etc.) to isolate NA were reviewed. Mechanism design process for a low cost and high precision system that requires minimal human operator intervention is carried out. The conceptual designs were developed and the final design of the device was made to comply with the selected components.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to characterise and {{quantify}} the emissions of volatile organic compounds that can be released into the air from stink blasters (a toy in human shape that releases malodorous substances after squeezing the head) and to evaluate possible health risks, particularly for children. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. a child¿s room) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies. The emissions of the items were investigated in environmental chambers and their content was assessed by chemical extraction. In addition to these preliminary experiments and in order to evaluate airborne exposure to cyclohexanone, the stink blasters were placed in the Indoortron facility, a 30 m 3 volume walk-in type environmental chamber, and tested for emissions after squeezing several times under ¿real world setting¿ conditions (23 C, 50 % relative humidity, 0. 5 air changes per hour). The amount of chemicals released was determined by applying two different techniques and time series analysis of the air inside the chamber sampled on Tenax TA <b>tubes</b> and DNPH <b>cartridges,</b> followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry and HPLC¿UV, respectively. The main resulting compounds emitted were cyclohexanone and toluene, with concentrations reaching values of 25 and 32 mgm 3, respectively. These levels are much lower than established permissible exposure limits. Measured toluene levels are also below the chronic inhalation reference limit value (300 mgm 3) set for this compound by the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA). However, such a value is not set for cyclohexanone, so attention should be given to chronic exposures at low concentration levels, in particular for sensitive sub-groups such as children. JRC.

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have greatly increased both {{the speed and}} throughput of genome and transcriptome sequencing. The pace of sequencing has further increased with target-enrichment and library barcoding techniques that allow multiplexing of sequencing runs. However, current manual methods for creating libraries do not scale well, limiting the practical investigation {{of large numbers of}} samples. To ease the library-creation bottleneck, we describe here a set of protocols, robotics scripts, bulk reagents and instrumentation developed to automate the production of up to 96 DNA fragment sequencing libraries at once. Current protocols for creating sequencing libraries are lengthy, laborious, and not amenable to automation. We describe here new magnetic bead based methods that produce libraries with yield, purity, and size-selection comparable or superior to current column and gel-based protocols. Using these bead-based methods we developed a unique combination of optimized adaptor concentrations and clean-up techniques which increase the yield of libraries from small amounts of DNA by several fold. We also describe robotic scripts for producing 1 – 96 libraries simultaneously on two commonly used robotic platforms. These protocols accept 10 – 8000 ng of sheared DNA, calculate and dilute barcode adaptors for each library as necessary, automate all intermediate processing steps, and deliver purified libraries ready for amplification off-instrument. An additional script for post-PCR purification of the libraries is also provided. We further describe the Library Builder™ System, comprising a bench top device and kits of plastic tips, <b>tubes</b> and sealed <b>cartridges</b> prefilled with reagents necessary for producing 1 to 13 DNA fragment libraries either with or without size selection. Our analysis of sequencing data shows that libraries produced by all of the above methods are free of excess adaptors which interfere with quantitation, are unbiased, of high complexity, and free from cross-contamination.
