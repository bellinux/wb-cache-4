The principal sort of people sent thither were, as I have said, servants who got the distemper by going of errands to fetch necessaries to the families where they lived, and who in that case, if they came home sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the house; and they were so well looked after there in all the time of the visitation that there was but 156 buried in all at the London pest-house, and 159 at that of Westminster.|$|E

5000|$|... "Strong" [...] {{was written}} by Louis Tomlinson, John Ryan, Jamie Scott and Julian Bunetta. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Bunetta said, [...] "We got into this discussion about how when you tell someone like 'I need you, I love you and I need you 'cause you make me strong,' essentially you can scare someone off. It's pressure, so people just kind of run from it. So, that's what the lyric is," [...] recalled Bunetta, who also helped produce songs on the album. [...] "It's saying 'I'm sorry if I say this, but fuck it.

He didn't care what people did or what people believed; he didn't have any real judgmentalism about people's personal choices. If you were an idiot he was very judgmental about that; he did not suffer fools well, but in terms of how you lived your life, he could not care at all.

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of Shattered Glass, Sarsgaard starred in several roles. In 2004, he starred in the comedy-drama Garden State, where he played Mark, the sarcastic best friend to Zach Braff's character. In the same year, Sarsgaard portrayed Clyde Martin, in the biographical film Kinsey, a movie {{about the life of}} Alfred Kinsey, played by Liam Neeson. Kinsey was Sarsgaard's first film role which {{featured}} full frontal nudity. Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Sarsgaard's Clyde Martin [...] "stands out" [...] and [...] "confirms that he's without doubt one of the best character actors of his generation." [...] When asked about his kissing scenes with Neeson in Kinsey, Sarsgaard said:It wasn’t as hard as, say, running around with all my gear on in Jarhead. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than physical exertion any day. The only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> actors get freaked out about when they have to do something like kiss a guy in a movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on.

5000|$|The episode's director, Alex Graves, {{described}} {{the scene in}} an interview with The Hollywood Reporter as [...] "and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her". In another interview with HitFix, Graves said [...] "it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for and Cersei ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle." [...] In an interview with Vulture, Graves further elaborated: [...] "The consensual part of it was that she wraps her legs around him, and she's holding on to the table, clearly not to escape but to get some grounding in what’s going on. And also, the other <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is clear before they hit the ground is she starts to make out with him. (...) before he rips her undergarment, she's way into kissing him back." [...] Graves stated that it was important for him and others involved with filming the scene to indicate to viewers that the sexual encounter was not completely one-sided, and that he hoped this aspect would not be overlooked. Noting that during filming, [...] "nobody really wanted to talk {{about what was going on}} between the two characters", he {{described the}} scene as [...] "one of my favorite scenes I've ever done".|$|E
40|$|According to {{a certain}} {{philosophical}} tradition, the fact that what one thinks {{might not be the}} case should be a problem. How can I think what there is not, as, if I am thinking, there is something for me to think? However it turns out that that <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> might not exist. So, it seems to be and not to be at the very same time. That kind of worry has given rise to that circle of problems that is known under the title of “intentional objects”. Intentional objects are objects of our mental attitudes. Their intentional being- that is to say their being thought of- does not entail necessarily their genuine being. Some hardliners of intentionality even claim that it excludes such genuine being, as what is intentionally just never is in the literal sense of the term.

The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'When you designed assignment(s), what learning goals for students did you have in mind?'Brief excerpt from interview: I'd say if there's an overarching goal, it's for students to gain a framework for understanding their own experience.
