John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed, but not entirely. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, [...] "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?" [...] Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-mâché bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|During a {{subsequent}} NPR talk show, Savage {{said that he}} has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, [...] "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia... <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{work from}} the early 1980s onward {{contained}} frequent condemnations of incest and pedophilia {{as one of the}} chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that [...] "incest is terrifically important in understanding the condition of women. It is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover". In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend Allen Ginsberg over his support for child pornography and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, [...] "The right wants <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jail," [...] and Dworkin responded, [...] "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you." [...] In 1985, When Hustler published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that regardless of whether Hustlers interpretations of her reflections on incest were valid, even a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the [...] "marketplace of ideas" [...] could not amount to defamation in the legal sense.|$|E

500|$|... "New Boss" [...] {{was written}} by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. [...] "New Boss" [...] {{was the first of}} six episodes Idris Elba was set to guest star in as Charles, Michael's new Dunder Mifflin superior. It was his first role in a comedy and his first television appearance since leaving his regular role on HBO's The Wire, where he played the character Stringer Bell. Elba, a fan of The Office, said, [...] "The creators of the show called me, said they wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> as this new character, that I’d be perfect for it, and I was honored, so I said yeah. [...] I’m still playing the straight guy, but he’s kind of got a bit of a quirk to him." [...] The writing staff for The Office are fans of The Wire, and have referred to the show in previous episodes. Of the six episodes Elba appeared in, he said [...] "New Boss" [...] was the only one he watched immediately after they aired because, [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Elba is the second actor from The Wire to appear on The Office, after actress Amy Ryan, who played Michael's love interest Holly Flax. Paul Lieberstein, the Office producer who also plays Toby, said Elba's work on The Wire made him [...] "a really interesting and great foil for Michael". John Krasinski said Elba was initially an intimidating presence on the set, due to the ruthless character he plays on The Wire. However, Krasinski said Elba proved to be [...] "incredibly nice and incredibly funny".|$|E
