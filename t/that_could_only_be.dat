5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought {{that he should be}} more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E

5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was {{willing or able to}} back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was {{responsible}} for the defence of the northern perimeter of the ANZAC beach-head, holding a sector from the position known as Walker's Top down the ridge line to the sea. Part of this defence line was formed by No.1 and No.2 Posts, isolated positions in the far north <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> approached in safety during the hours of darkness. Near the end of May 1915, the Turks started constructing a new position just inland from No.2 Post, that if left to be completed would cause problems for the New Zealanders. Therefore, it was decided to assault and capture the post. After the position was captured, it was named No.3 Post, and the New Zealanders settled in and attempted to improve its defences. The same night, the Turks counter-attacked. Surrounded and cut {{off from the rest of}} the brigade, running short of ammunition and supplies, the defending 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron held out for twenty-eight hours until relieved, and beat off several attempts to break through their lines. When the squadron was eventually relieved it was decided the post was untenable, and it was abandoned the same night.|$|E

5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E
25|$|That war {{resulted}} in a boundary being defined between the Indians and English lands <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> crossed for official business with a special pass. This situation would last until 1677 and the Treaty of Middle Plantation, which established Indian reservations following Bacon's Rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Some {{difficulties}} {{were discovered}} in the late 19th century <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to compatibility with electromagnetic theory, and the famous Michelson–Morley experiment. The resolution of these problems led to the special theory of relativity, often included in the term classical mechanics.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1939, Botvinnik won the USSR Championship, and {{his book}} on the tournament {{described}} the approach to preparation {{which he had been}} developing since 1933. One striking feature of this was emphasis on opening preparation in order to gain a permanent positional advantage in the middle game, rather than seeking immediate tactical surprises <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used once.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} problems, notably a lack of horizontal stability, an underpowered trim system, landing gear <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> extended at slow speeds, an unreliable airspeed indicator, and a cramped cockpit. The test pilots also requested that six guns be installed. The stability problem was addressed on the second prototype by adding a triangular fillet {{to the front of}} the vertical stabilizer. The extra guns could not be incorporated due to weight and balance considerations.|$|E
25|$|However, {{like the}} No 1, the No 2 {{required}} a special detonator that {{was similar to}} the one used in the No 1. This made it even more difficult to get adequate supplies of the No 2 to the troops and further tied up supplies. Arguably, the No 2 made the grenade problem worse for the British, as there had to be separate detonators for the No 1 and No 2 <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made by a small group of firms.|$|E

25|$|Under Hjalmar Schacht, {{a policy}} was {{introduced}} whereby certain nations who traded with Germany (such as the United States) {{had to deal}} with special banks. Foreign currency was deposited in these institutions and Americans were paid for their goods (especially raw materials) in scrips <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> redeemed for German goods in kind. Soon these scrips declined in value, as they were not truly fungible. Many were used by travellers to Germany in the mid-1930s. Schacht was able to build up foreign currency reserves for later use.|$|E
25|$|The {{sport was}} aided by several new {{technologies}} of the era. The {{advent of the}} railroad permitted pigeons {{to be sent to}} distant release points quickly and at modest cost. In addition the creation of mass-produced, sophisticated timing clocks brought accurate and secure timing to the sport. These clocks were designed with special compartments where an entry band, removed from the returning race bird was placed. When struck, the clock recorded the time and also placed the band in a compartment <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> opened by race officials.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{inmates were}} housed in cells <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{accessed}} by entering {{through a small}} exercise yard attached {{to the back of}} the prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a church.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{the state}} {{constitution}} was amended to establish the Supreme Court and Superior Court as constitutional courts, which means <b>that</b> they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> changed or abolished by a constitutional amendment, not by the legislature.|$|R

25|$|Griffith CJ {{expressed}} stronger {{views in}} relation to the constitutionality of the common rule provisions, stating that the function of an arbitrator was a judicial function <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> exercised between parties to the dispute and after hearing them. The power to make a common rule award was a legislative function which, consistent with the decision in Whybrow (No 1), could not be conferred on the Arbitration Court. Griffith CJ emphasised the settlement of disputes between parties, with no apparent consideration as to the constitutional power {{in relation to}} the prevention of disputes. Griffith CJ held that the common rule provisions being unconstitutional did not invalidate the entire Act.|$|E
