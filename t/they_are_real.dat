25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to make {{judgments}} as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E
25|$|Set in New York City, {{the play}} opens {{at the end}} of October 1985, with Louis Ironson, a gay Jew, {{learning}} that his lover, WASP Prior Walter, has AIDS. As Prior's illness progresses, Louis becomes unable to cope and moves out, leaving Prior to deal with his abandonment. Prior begins to receive visits from a pair of ghosts who claim to be his own ancestors, and hears an angelic voice telling him to prepare for her arrival.

25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie {{has a hard time}} accepting that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real.</b> He wants to believe that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E

500|$|The story {{tells of}} a prince who wants to marry a princess, but is having {{difficulty}} finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets, and he cannot be certain <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> princesses because they have bad table manners or they are too fat or thin or not beautiful. [...] One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She {{claims to be a}} princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges in her stomach, as if {{something}} {{is trying to get}} out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett approaches Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, he is able to fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real,</b> they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E

She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] {{are always going to be}} real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that I have now, the girls love them because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real.</b> If I am feeling hurt and need to curse to express that, then I will.

500|$|In {{addition}} to content generating bots, users can purchase followers, favorites, retweets and comments on various websites {{that cater to}} expanding a user's image through accumulation of followers. With more followers, users' profiles gain more attention, thus increasing their popularity. Generating Web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability. With Twitterbots, users are able {{to create the illusion}} of [...] "buzz" [...] on their site by obtaining followers from services such as Swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms. The companies that facilitate this service create fake Twitter accounts that follow a number of people, some of these Twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>real.</b> This practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on Twitter. The emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities, politicians, musicians, public figures, and companies alike. According to The New York Times, bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections, influence the stock market, public appeal, and attack governments.|$|E
