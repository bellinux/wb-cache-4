These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

[...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It {{was a little bit}}.

500|$|Beckinsale {{decided at}} a young age she wanted to be an actress: [...] "I grew up {{immersed}} in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents." [...] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau.

500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E

2500|$|In several interviews, Cheung stated {{he had had}} {{a fairly}} unhappy childhood. [...] "I didn't have a happy childhood. Arguments, fights and we didn't live together; I was brought up by my granny." [...] "What I would say most {{affected}} me as a child, was <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> were not at home with me.

Mandelbrot attended the Lycée Rolin in Paris until the start of World War II, when his family then moved to Tulle, France.

2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E

But I never cared myself for {{anything}} but natural history and botany and things like <b>that.</b> <b>My</b> poor <b>parents</b> have been dead some years now, but--naturally I like to respect their wishes.

2500|$|Meg Cabot quotes the series' {{inspiration}} on her website stating: [...] "I {{was inspired}} to write The Princess Diaries when my mom, {{after the death of}} my father, began dating one of my teachers; they later went on to get married just as Mia’s mom does in the book!
