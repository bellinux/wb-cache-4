5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 3 August 1914, Józef Piłsudski formed a small cadre military unit, the First Cadre Company—the predecessor of the Polish Legions—which set out from Kraków <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the liberation of Poland. The city was briefly besieged by Russian troops in November 1914. Austrian rule in Kraków ended in 1918 when the Polish Liquidation Committee assumed power.|$|E
5|$|Other than Belushi's opening yell, {{the food}} fight was filmed in one shot, with the actors {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> real.

By filming the long courtroom scene in one day Landis won a bet with Reitman.|$|E

5|$|Part of the National Policy was {{implemented}} in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> higher tariffs {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E

5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating {{in the formation of the}} Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E

His older brother, Joe, {{was assigned to the}} 41st Armored Infantry Division in Europe. He was killed in April 1945, just days before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the {{independence}} of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police {{to withdraw from the}} village.|$|E

5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|In May, Natalia {{was granted}} a travel permit to join Michael. Accompanied by family friends Prince Putyatin and Margaret Abakanovich, she arrived at Perm before the Orthodox Easter and they spent about a week together. Meanwhile, {{as part of the}} truce between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers, prisoners-of-war from Austria–Hungary were being shipped out of Russia. Czech troops were strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway on their way to Vladivostok, where they were due to take ship. The Czechs, though, were not going home <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the Austrian empire but <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> a {{separate}} homeland independent of Austria. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, who fought back, seized the railway, joined forces with Russians fighting against the Bolsheviks and advanced westwards toward Perm. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in a dangerous situation and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.|$|E
5|$|Lord Goring, who had {{proposed}} the second siege, renewed the blockade {{for a third}} time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon's departing army and forcing it back into Taunton. Goring's siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, who would have otherwise been available <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> King Charles at Naseby, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, Thomas Fairfax marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.|$|E
