50|$|The 'contrade' are {{the typical}} districts of the {{settlement}} of the Lessini Mountains, consisting of single-family houses with stables and other buildings as the icehouses and the 'baiti', where cheese was made. The building materials were mainly two : the stone for the exterior and wood for the interior, as these materials are easily found in the surrounding area. Preferably {{they used to be}} built in sunny places and sheltered by a hillock. Around the districts there are quite a lot of meadows, which were once cultivated with rye and, in the lowest areas, with wheat, as well as numerous fruit trees, such as sour cherry, walnut, and in the lowest districts, even wild apple and pear trees; these trees, planted in regular rows, used to demarcate the boundaries of a property. Today the 'contrade' are connected with each other through streets, but once the steps were possible only by mule tracks or paths, allowing the <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{name of the}} {{incorporated}} company was changed slightly, and the Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway Act was passed on 13 July 1871. The company had powers to build a railway 4 miles 5 furlongs in length from Mitcheldean Road station to the Forest of Dean Railway branch at Whimsey. The capital was £30,000 in £10 shares, and there were borrowing powers for £10,000. The GWR was authorised to subscribe up to half the capital. Five years were allowed for completion of the line; {{there was no mention}} of carrying passengers. The engineer's estimate for construction was £28,268, no stations being envisaged. The company was authorised to enter into agreements with the GWR for working and maintaining the line. By the time of the Act, the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line was standard gauge but the Forest of Dean Railway branch was still broad gauge, giving the Mitcheldean Road company a significant, but temporary, commercial advantage, in that onward <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> loaded <b>wagons</b> did not require transshipment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{attendance}} {{of the demand}} for freight transport {{is related to the}} process of allocation <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> that in turn is associated with {{the way in which the}} decision is taken. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to the shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons.</b> In addition, the trips <b>of</b> the empty <b>wagons</b> have the major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the problem related to the distribution <b>of</b> the load <b>wagons</b> and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling <b>of</b> the <b>wagons...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the running}} smoothness of the rolling-stock {{as the main}} feature <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> dynamics. The running smoothness <b>of</b> the freight <b>wagon</b> is evaluated considering the parameters of vibrations and the oscillation process.

Four-axle freight wagon movement down the track taking into account the given vertical and lateral irregularities has been simulated using software package “Universal Mechanism”. The dependencies of the oscillation amplitudes <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> body on track irregularities and vertical and lateral suspension settings have been defined. The dependencies <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> suspension settings and derailment stability on changes in the wagon mass have been examined in the paper. Finally, basic conclusions have been given...|$|R
