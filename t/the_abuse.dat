40|$|The accusatorial {{principle}} {{provides the}} basis for the South African taw o f criminal procedure. In practice this results in <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child being subjected to substantial trauma when it is called upon to give evidence in such a case. <b>The</b> <b>abused</b> child is often still battling to regain its self-esteem and self-confidence {{at the time of the}} trial. By subjecting <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child to <b>the</b> giving of vidence and being cross-examined in the presence of the accused, the child's chances of regaining its selfesteem are rendered very slim indeed. In the interest of <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child, and to satisfy the requirement of justice for all, an alternative to the existing system has to be found. In order to improve on the current situation, it is the author’s submission that a form of procedure should be adopted through which the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>abused</b> child in court during such a trial will be obviated. Some specific proposals to achieve this are made by the author...|$|R
5|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a 2007 {{novel by}} Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. It is his second, {{following}} his bestselling 2003 debut, The Kite Runner.

5|$|ContactPoint was a {{government}} database that held information on all children under 18 in England. It {{was created in}} response to <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> and death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbié in 2000 in England. Various agencies involved in her care had failed to prevent her death. ContactPoint aimed to improve child protection by improving the way information about children was shared between services. It was designed by Capgemini and previously had the working titles of Information Sharing Index (or IS Index or ISI) and the Children's Index.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) {{contemporary and}} historical pornography {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.|$|E

5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of the pope from the litany and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The film {{breaks into}} three {{distinct}} acts. In the first, the former Scientologists describe how they joined Scientology; {{the second act}} recounts the history of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard; and in the final act, the film airs allegations of <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of church members and misconduct by its leadership, particularly David Miscavige, {{who is accused of}} intimidating, beating, imprisoning, and exploiting subordinates. The film depicts the role played by celebrity members, such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise, through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists.|$|E
5|$|The film deconstructs the church's {{claims by}} {{presenting}} a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, L.

The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims to find <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> {{experienced by}} Tess Stevens, {{the causes of}} <b>the</b> <b>abuses,</b> <b>the</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>abuses,</b> and <b>the</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> on Tess’ personality development in the autobiography of Sold. In order to answer the objectives, this research employed Erikson’s psychosocial theory and <b>the</b> theories of <b>abuse</b> by several scholars. This study is a qualitative research employing content analysis method. The data of this research are words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs which are taken from an autobiography entitled Sold which have correlation with {{the objectives of the}} research. Since this is a qualitative research, the researcher was the primary instrument of this research, while the table sheets were the secondary instruments. The data analysis was conducted through four steps: reading and re- reading, arranging and sorting the categorized data, interpreting, and reporting the findings in the research. In order to obtain trustworthiness, the researcher conducted triangulation. The findings of the research show that there are four abuses experienced by Tess: psychological abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and physical <b>abuse.</b> <b>The</b> second finding shows that there are four causes of the abuses: gender inequality, poverty, abuser’s past experience, and parent’s divorce. The researcher also found that there are four effects of the abuses: genophobia, juvenile delinquency and adult crime, physical wound in certain area of the body, and difficulties in socializing. Finally, there are four effects of <b>the</b> <b>abuses</b> on Tess’ personality development: inferiority, role confusion, isolation, and generativity...|$|R

5|$|Two {{weeks before}} her mother's death in 1967, 16-year-old Jayne Marie accused Sam Brody, her mother's boyfriend at that time, of beating her. The girl's {{statement}} to {{officers of the}} Los Angeles Police Department the following morning implicated her mother in encouraging <b>the</b> <b>abuse,</b> and days later a juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of Jayne Marie to Paul's uncle William W.

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

Brian has started to abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from bulimia due to <b>the</b> <b>abuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate <b>the</b> <b>abuse</b> of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
