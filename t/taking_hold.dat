5|$|In 1940, Mussolini {{took his}} country into World War II {{on the side}} of Nazi Germany but soon met with {{military}} failure. By the autumn of 1943, he was reduced to being the leader of a German puppet state in northern Italy and was faced with the Allied advance from the south and an increasingly violent internal conflict with the partisans. In April 1945, with the Allies breaking through the last German defences in northern Italy and a general uprising of the partisans <b>taking</b> <b>hold</b> in the cities, Mussolini's situation became untenable. On 25 April he fled Milan, where he had been based, and tried to escape to the Swiss border. He and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were captured on 27 April by local partisans near the village of Dongo on Lake Como. Mussolini and Petacci were shot the following afternoon, two days before Adolf Hitler's suicide.|$|E

At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E

By the early 1930s every piece of land had been foreclosed on. In 1935 the ranch was sold to William A. Spence.

25|$|There is however {{evidence}} that the revitalization efforts are <b>taking</b> <b>hold,</b> {{as can be seen}} in the teaching of Te Reo in school curriculum, Te Reo's use as an instructional language, and the supportive ideologies surrounding these efforts. A survey was conducted in 2014 consisting of students ranging in age from 18–24 and were of mixed ethnic backgrounds ranging from Pākehā to Māori who lived in New Zealand. This survey showed a 62% response saying that Te Reo was at risk. Albury argues that these results come from either Te Reo not being used enough in common discourse or the number of speakers was inadequate for future language development. Albury argues that the opinions toward Maori language revitalization is important because they shape the success of policies put forth by the government.|$|E
25|$|A brotherhood was {{established}} in Compostela in 1418, {{taking advantage of the}} temporal absence of the archbishop, and violently <b>taking</b> <b>hold</b> of the city in 1422, overruling the City Council. Another one, called Fusquenlla or 'The Mad Brotherhood', rose up in the north of the kingdom against the House of Andrade. The armies of the brotherhood, directed by the lesser nobleman Roi Xordo, were finally defeated by the Andrade's armies by the gates of Compostela in 1431. Later, in 1453, the troops of the bishop of Ourense and that of the Council of the city fought fiercely for the possession of the local castles, even using tronos (cannons, literally 'thunders'), and forcing the bishop into the exile. In 1458 a brotherhood {{was established}} bringing together some important noblemen (the House of Moscoso, the House of Estrada, and Sueiro Gomes de Soutomaior among others) and the cities and towns of Compostela, Noia, and Muros, against the archbishop of Santiago, who was first caught as a prisoner, being kept and paraded in a cage for two years, later being banished for ten years after their supporters had paid an onerous rescue. Similar revolts were producing all over the kingdom, in Betanzos, Viveiro, Lugo and Allariz. All of these Galician brotherhoods acted autonomously, sometimes even against King's will and direct orders.|$|E

25|$|Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz's II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) {{around the}} British west flank {{to prevent a}} British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat {{southwest}} towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions {{as it had been}} joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury's Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man <b>taking</b> <b>hold</b> of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15pm on 21 August and 8.25pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.|$|E
