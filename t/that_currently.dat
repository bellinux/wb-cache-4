5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded <b>that,</b> <b>currently,</b> no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{there were three}} mosques, two schools, two takyas and a hammam on the citadel. The citadel also housed a synagogue until 1957. The only {{religious}} structure <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque, which was rebuilt on the location of an earlier 19th-century mosque. The hammam was built in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It went out of service during the 1970s and was renovated in 1979, although many original architectural details were lost.|$|E

5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused mesquite {{to spread}} inland while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever.

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> practices manned spaceflight.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year extension to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties would have received a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure Rural Schools Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. This was widely expected to be the last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year extension to the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi {{is known}} from four places on Madagascar, all below 80m (260ft) altitude, of which two {{are on the}} west and two {{on the east side}} of the island. Among the eastern {{collection}} sites, Kianjavato is a rural town surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where P.raceyi were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a mistnet over a river, and Tampolo is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, Kirindy and Mikea, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle Hypsugo anchietae has also been recorded. The true distribution of P.raceyi is probably larger than <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.|$|E

5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller. Should a vacancy arise in either of the two houses of the General Assembly, the Governor also fills that vacancy, though the Governor must choose from among the recommendations of the local party organization to which the person leaving the vacancy belonged. Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal. Among the most prominent of the Governor's appointees are the 24 secretaries and heads of departments <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> make up the Governor's Cabinet, also known as the Executive Council.|$|E
5|$|The central {{highlands}} of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, called Altiplano Cundiboyacense was inhabited by indigenous groups from 12,500 BP, as evidenced from archaeological finds at rock shelter El Abra, presently part of Zipaquirá. The first human occupation consisted of hunter-gatherers who foraged {{in the valleys}} and mountains of the Andean high plateau. Settlement in the early millennia of this Andean preceramic age was mainly restricted to caves and rock shelters, such as Tequendama in present-day Soacha, Piedras del Tunjo in Facatativá and Checua <b>that</b> <b>currently</b> {{is part of the}} municipality Nemocón. Around 3000 BC, the inhabitants of the Andean plains started to live in open space areas and constructed primitive circular houses where they elaborated the stone tools used for hunting, fishing, food preparation and primitive art, mostly rock art. The type site for this transition is the archaeological site Aguazuque, in the northwest of Soacha, close to Bogotá.|$|E
