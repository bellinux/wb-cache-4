5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
50|$|Stocks are an {{external}} framework in a shipyard {{used to support}} construction of (usually) wooden ships. They are normally associated with a slipway <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> slide down into the water. In addition <b>to</b> supporting <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> itself, they are typically used to give access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> bottom and sides.|$|R
50|$|On 4 November 2014 a fire {{broke out}} aboard <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> during a routine {{servicing}} in Sevastopol. According to officials nobody was injured and the fire was contained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> aft. According <b>to</b> some sources <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> is laid up for scrapping. However, according <b>to</b> others <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> will be repaired and {{will be returned to}} active service.|$|R

5|$|Hermann Schoemann was {{undamaged}} by British aircraft, but {{was repeatedly}} {{struck in the}} stern by 20mm cannon shells from the defending German fighters. Later that afternoon, Vice Admiral (Vizeadmiral) Otto Ciliax, commander of the battleship flotilla, was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> after his temporary flagship, the destroyer , was disabled by a premature detonation {{in one of her}} guns that sent shrapnel into the machinery spaces.|$|E
5|$|Hoshi Sato, {{played by}} Linda Park, is {{communications}} {{officer of the}} Enterprise and linguistic genius. Capable of learning alien languages extremely quickly, Hoshi serves as the interpreter between the Enterprise crew and new alien species, even after the universal translator is on-line. She suffered anxiety about her place on board originally, but exposure to frequent danger helped her realize her value <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} episode, the Vorticon {{mothership}} has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen journeys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{to find and}} deactivate each of the cannons. Keen does so by fighting more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's control. At {{the end of the}} episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.|$|E

5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, {{as former}} CIA Director, {{one of the}} few aware of the aliens' {{existence}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> recovered at Roswell. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North. The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki, MGM's head of advertising, who made life unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of Stargate.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2011, two workmen {{suffered}} {{minor injuries}} after {{a section of}} gangway, connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> collapsed during renovation works. The ship was closed to visitors following the accident. An investigation later established that {{the collapse of the}} gangway had been caused by a subcontractor cutting through the gangway's structure during refurbishment work. Belfast re-opened on 18 May 2012.|$|E

5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E
5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down or forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, the thrall {{girl was}} taken away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> She removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. Thereafter she removed her finger rings and gave them to the old woman's daughters, who had guarded her. Then they took her aboard the ship, {{but they did not}} allow her to enter the tent where the dead {{chieftain}} lay. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang and bade her friends farewell.|$|E

5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared {{because they}} were considered useful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate. Southcott lived {{to be a key}} witness, along with Casey, who was also spared, and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials of many of the mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E
5|$|While {{exploring}} Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet B.E.N., {{an abandoned}} robot, {{who says he}} has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place for shelter. The pirates corner the group here; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, however, on return, they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.|$|E
5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vyborg was modernized {{during the}} 1950s and served {{for a while}} as an {{accommodation}} ship in Tallinn. Preparations <b>to</b> scrap <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> were begun in 1958. During this time, there were talks <b>to</b> return <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> Finland. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> was, however, scrapped in 1966 at a Leningrad scrapyard. According to Soviet calculations, 2,700 tons of metal were recovered.|$|R

5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-day}} away mission spent apologising {{on the planet}} Kreetassa, the away team {{consisting}} of Captain Archer, Sub-Commander T'Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer's dog, Porthos, return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans. Archer reacts poorly to the news and is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
