40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} was conducted to find relevant publications on the validity, reliability and utilization of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> in detection of stress and simple fractures. Medline 1966 - 1998, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) 1982 - 1997, Science Citation Index 1961 - 1997, Index to chiropractic literature 1980 - 1998 and Chiropractic Research Archives Collection 1984 - 1990 data bases were searched. Key words such as tuning fork, vibration, diapason, fracture, stress fracture were used. The literature regarding the utilization of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> in detection of fractures is very scarce. There was no study found in the above data bases on the validity and or reliability of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> in detection of simple acute fractures.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>tests</b> for detecting fractures. Design: Systematic review of primary studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>tests</b> {{for the presence}} of fracture. Data source: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, Sports Discus, CAB Abstracts and Web of Science from commencement to November 2012. We manually searched the reference lists of any review papers and any identified relevant studies. Study selection and data extraction: Two reviewers independently reviewed the list of potentially eligible studies and rated the studies for quality using the QUADAS- 2 tool. Data were extracted to form 2 x 2 contingency tables. The primary outcome measure was the accuracy of the test as measured by its sensitivity and specificity with 95 % CIs. Data synthesis: We included six studies (329 patients), with two types of <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>tests</b> (pain induction and loss of sound transmission). The studies included patients with an age range 7 - 60 years. The prevalence of fracture ranged from 10 % to 80 %. The sensitivity of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>tests</b> was high, ranging from 75 % to 100 %. The specificity of the tests was highly heterogeneous, ranging from 18 % to 95 %. Conclusions: Based on the studies in this review, <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>tests</b> have some value in ruling out fractures, but are not sufficiently reliable or accurate for widespread clinical use.

40|$|Aim and methodology: Ankle {{injuries}} {{account for}} 8 % of all minor injuries attending emergency {{departments in the}} United Kingdom and the Ottawa ankle rules were introduced to assess the need for x-ray in the early 1990 s (Stiell et al 1992). Although the rules {{are said to have}} reduced the number of ankle x-rays requested the frequency of fractures in the population still receiving x-rays is only 15 % nationally. This study aims to assess whether the tuning fork can increase the diagnostic accuracy of the Ottawa ankle rules when used on twisting ankle injuries by multiple operators in multiple emergency care settings. A mixed methods study conducted in two phases was undertaken. Phase one consisted of a diagnostic test study using the Ottawa ankle rules in conjunction with the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> on patients already screened as being Ottawa positive to the ‘malleolar’ zone and requiring an x-ray of their ankle. Patients aged 12 years or over who had sustained an ankle injury by a twisting mechanism were eligible to take part. Patient age, gender, ethnicity, and previous history of injury or presence of distracting injuries, degree of swelling, and role of operator were all considered potential variables for an accurate <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test,</b> and these were analyzed individually and in a multiple logistical regression model to assess for predictor variables of a correct <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test.</b> Phase two of the study included a series of focus group discussions to explore participant and clinician experiences of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test.</b> Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Data was collected for 2 -years and 1313 patients were included in the final analysis. 56 % of the study participants were male. Mean age was 34 years (range 12 - 91). 98 % were of white ethnic origin. 210 (16 %) were diagnosed with fractures, of which 38 were deemed to be not clinically significant. The tuning fork had a diagnostic accuracy of 56 % (95 % CI 53 - 58), NPV 96 % (95 % CI 94 - 97), sensitivity 84 % (95 % CI 78 - 89) and specificity 51 % (95 % CI 48 - 54). X-rays could have been reduced by 47 % but this was at the expense of missing 29 ‘clinically significant’ fractures. However, seven of these were managed as soft tissue injuries and in nine the initial assessment of tenderness did not match the site of the fracture. A total of 113 clinicians (nurses & doctors) were involved in performing the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> independently. Patient age (adjusted OR 1. 021, p. < 0. 001) and role of the operator (adjusted OR 1. 595, p. 0. 003 for nurse) were the only predictors of an accurate test. Ten patients and ten clinicians attended the focus group discussions in phase two of the study. Patients and clinicians appeared to accept the tuning fork as a method for assessment provided adequate explanation was given. Patients claimed the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> was not painful but had a similar sensation to that of a ‘Tens’ machine. There were differences in opinion between the two groups as to whether the tuning fork was accurate or not and clinicians held the perception that patients expect an x-ray when they present with an ankle injury, whereas patients disagreed with this. Patients were fully aware of the dangers of x-rays and stated that a reduction in x-rays {{was one of the main}} potential benefits of the study. Conclusions This is the largest study to investigate the accuracy of the tuning fork to detect fractures, not only in the size of the study population but the number of clinicians involved. It is also the first to report inconclusive Ottawa ankle rule and <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> results. It is unlikely that the lower sensitivity will be accepted by patients and clinicians. Further research to assess inter-operator reliability is recommended before implementing the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> into clinical practice.

40|$|Harsh {{environment}} applications include high temperature, {{pressure and}} mechanical shock. Aluminum nitride {{is a strong}} ceramic material with very good high temperature survivability. It also has piezoelectric properties {{that can be used}} for sensing applications and it can be deposited with good control as thin polycrystalline film for the fabrication of micro-electromechanical systems. In this dissertation, optimized deposition parameters for aluminum nitride films and characterization techniques for film stress gradients are investigated. Furthermore, two different fabrication processes are presented that can be used to build several sensors and other micromechanical elements on a single chip. The more advanced process includes a bulk-micromachining step that enables the use of the silicon substrate as large proof masses for accelerometers. At the same time, the fabrication process can be used to create membranes for devices such as pressure sensors. Several different devices are discussed from the device design and theoretical analysis to the fabrication and experimental verification. The most significant contribution is the performance improvement of several orders of magnitude that can be achieved with aluminum nitride accelerometers by switching from double-ended <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> to triple-beam <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> and by using the newly discovered sensing concept of bent-beam sensing.

40|$|Background Ankle sprain is {{frequently}} encountered, both {{in primary care}} and in emergency departments. Since 1992, the Ottawa ankle rules (OAR) can assist clinicians in determining whether an X-ray should be performed to exclude a fracture. Several guidelines recommend the use of OAR based on a systematic review from 2003. Ten years later, one can wonder if this recommendation should be changed. Objective To review systematically the current evidence on the most accurate method to assess the fracture risk after an ankle sprain in adults. Methods A methodical search for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and primary studies {{was carried out in}} Medline, Cochrane Database of systematic reviews, Embase, Pedro, CINAHL, Medion and specific guideline search engines. At least two independent researchers performed selection, quality appraisal (with validated checklists) and data extraction. Results One systematic review and 21 primary studies were selected. Sensitivity and specificity of the OAR range from 92  100 % and from 16  51 %, respectively. To improve the OAR specificity, other tools are proposed such as the Bernese ankle rules. Vibrating <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> and ultrasound could be useful in patient with OAR positive to decrease the need for radiographs. No evidence was found in favour of the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) in the acute phase of ankle sprain.

In order to evaluate the effect of regular nose blowing on the resolution of serous otitis a randomized trial was carried out in a community health audiology department in Oxfordshire over the period 1983 - 87. A total of 84 children aged three and a half to four and a half years, found to have a conductive hearing loss owing to serous otitis were included in the study. The hearing test combined a discrimination test of seven named toys and full audiometry with earphones. The children's ears were examined by otoscope and Rinne's <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> was performed. Randomly selected children were advised to blow their noses or were given no advice. The children were retested two months later and the outcome determined for children who were or were not given advice and who were or were not naturally good nose blowers. A record was made of any surgical intervention by insertion of ventilating tubes carried out before the children started school and of the results of the children's routine hearing tests on school entry. No significant differences in the proportion of children passing the second hearing test were found between children advised to blow their noses and those given no advice or between those children who were naturally good at nose blowing and those who were not.

40|$|The Ottawa ankle {{rules are}} a {{clinical}} instrument calibrated towards a high sensitivity {{in order not}} to miss any fractures of the ankle or mid‐foot. This is at the cost of a mean specificity of around only 32 %. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the suitability of tuning fork testing in combination with existing Ottawa guidance for increasing the specificity in detecting fractures of the lateral malleolus. A prospective pilot study was carried out, in which a single trained investigator examined all patients with already “Ottawa positive” findings for possible lateral malleolus injury by applying a tuning fork (C° 128  Hz). The <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> <b>test</b> findings were compared with formal reports of plain ankle radiographs using simple cross‐table analysis. The observed prevalence of ankle fractures was 5 of 49 (10 %). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 100 % and 61 %, respectively, for tuning fork testing on the tip of the lateral malleolus (TLM), and as 100 % and 95 %, respectively, for testing on the distal fibula shaft (DFS). The associated positive and negative likelihood ratios were 2. 59 and 0 (TLM), and 22 and 0 (DFS), respectively. The data were significant, with p =  0. 014 (TLM) and p< 0. 001 (DFS). This study suggests that additional tuning fork testing of “Ottawa positive” patients may lead to a marked reduction in ankle radiographs, with consequently reduced radiation exposure and journey time. This may be particularly relevant in situations where radiological facilities are not readily available (expedition medicine) or where access to these has to be prioritised (major incidents, natural catastrophes) ...|$|E

40|$|When a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is sounded {{and held}} in the air, the sound is weak due to the poor {{acoustic}} coupling between the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> and the air. If the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is struck and acoustically coupled to a box of the proper size, as in Figure 1, the box functions as a resonator at {{the frequency of the}} <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> the sound of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is much louder, as can be heard on the video. When the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is placed on a box of a different resonant frequency, the sound does not become as loud, as demonstrated in the video...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Rinne test {{generally}} detects large air-bone gaps; {{this approach}} decreases {{the value of}} <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> as a screening tool. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of simple <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> modifications to increase the sensitivity of the Rinne test. MATERIALS and METHODS: Two different modifications were performed with 128 and 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks.</b> Fifteen healthy subjects with otolaryngology specialist training backgrounds were enrolled in the measurement of <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> sound-intensity output at their bone conduction threshold. RESULTS: The reductions in the threshold gap required for the Rinne test to turn from positive to negative for 128 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> were not statistically significant. The threshold gap was reduced by 3. 85 ± 3. 88 dB when 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> were modified through metal disk attachment (p= 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The modified 256 Hz <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> effectively reduced the subjective loudness gap between the two ends of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> in the Rinne test. The modification theoretically increases the sensitivity of the Rinne test, which may increase the value of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> as hearing loss screening tools...|$|R

40|$|The quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> has {{recently}} {{become a popular}} experimental tool for investigations of both classical and quantum turbulence in cryogenic helium. Its increased use in low-temperature experiments {{and a number of}} puzzling results obtained in the past have led to many questions concerning the interaction of multiple <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> or the interaction of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> with other oscillators. We report measurements performed in He II at low temperatures around 360 mK, on the mutual interaction of <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> placed in the same volume of fluid, and examine the responsible mechanisms in an effort to discriminate between acoustic coupling and interaction via quantized vortices. To this end, the interaction of two <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> is investigated by analyzing their recorded resonance curves, looking for any nonelectrical crosstalk. Further, the forcevelocity characteristics of a detector <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> are measured for different operating velocities of a generator <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> As a complementary measurement, the intensity of sound waves is recorded using a set of miniature receivers. We confirm the current knowledge on acoustic emission by <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> in He II and verify properties of their radiation patterns. We conclude that in our experiment the interaction is almost entirely mediated by sound waves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> has a (zyω) 5 ° cut shape[1], its {{structure}} and vibration mode are different with H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> clearly, {{and we have}} applied for a patent for {{the structure of the}} double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> gyroscope. It is desired that the driving signal has very high frequency stability and amplitude stability on the operation of the quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> But, the quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> resonant frequency of the reference mode may change with temperature, and if the driving signal frequency can’t automatically track the resonant frequency of the reference mode, the error signal will appear in the output angular rate signal. Based on the severe nonlinearity drift error induced by temperature change, a practical and precise composite model was proposed to compensate the error caused by temperature change. The double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> gyroscope temperature modeling was set up by test experiment and data processing at full temperature range, the accuracy of the double-H quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> gyroscope was improved greatly by utilizing temperature compensation, and the experiment results indicate that the method is useful and feasible...|$|R
50|$|A qPlus sensor {{is used in}} many {{ultra-high vacuum}} nc-AFMs. The sensor was {{originally}} made from a quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> from a wristwatch. In contrast to a quartz <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> sensor that consists of two coupled tines that oscillate opposed to each other, a qPlus sensor has only one tine that oscillates. The <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is glued to a mount such that one tine of the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> is immobilised, a tungsten wire, etched to have a sharp apex, is then glued to the free prong. The sensor was invented in 1996 by physicist Franz J. Giessibl. The AFM deflection signal is generated by the piezoelectric effect, and can be read from the two electrodes on the <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|R
