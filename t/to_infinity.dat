5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b> The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend <b>to</b> <b>infinity</b> as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink <b>to</b> <b>infinity</b> toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b> The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E

5|$|Matrix {{calculations}} can be often {{performed with}} different techniques. Many {{problems can be}} solved by both direct algorithms or iterative approaches. For example, the eigenvectors of a square matrix {{can be obtained by}} finding a sequence of vectors xn converging to an eigenvector when n tends <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs <b>to</b> <b>infinity</b> at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Compare this to {{the variety}} V(y'x3). This is a cubic curve. As x goes <b>to</b> {{positive}} <b>infinity,</b> {{the slope of the}} line from the origin to the point (x,x3) goes <b>to</b> positive <b>infinity</b> just as before. But unlike before, as x goes <b>to</b> negative <b>infinity,</b> the slope of the same line goes <b>to</b> positive <b>infinity</b> as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior [...] "at infinity" [...] of V(y'x3) is different from the behavior [...] "at infinity" [...] of V(y'x2).|$|R
5000|$|Compare this to {{the variety}} V(y &minus; x3). This is a cubic curve. As x goes <b>to</b> {{positive}} <b>infinity,</b> {{the slope of the}} line from the origin to the point (x, x3) goes <b>to</b> positive <b>infinity</b> just as before. But unlike before, as x goes <b>to</b> negative <b>infinity,</b> the slope of the same line goes <b>to</b> positive <b>infinity</b> as well; the exact opposite of the parabola.

5|$|This form of Cotes's spirals {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's spirals (Figure 8). The possible values of λ range from zero <b>to</b> <b>infinity,</b> which {{corresponds to}} values of μ greater than the positive number L12/m. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that L is not too large for the given μ.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b> Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero <b>to</b> <b>infinity,</b> which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Halsey {{is brought}} <b>to</b> <b>Infinity</b> {{due to her}} {{knowledge}} of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on New Phoenix. While studying the artifact, Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him {{to work on a}} Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing 'Mdama's troops, Crimson Squad recovers another artifact. When Halsey examines the device, it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching the artifact looking for answers, Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with 'Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E

5|$|Chief and Cortana use {{a fighter}} {{to follow the}} Didact's ship through slipspace towards Earth. Aided by Infinity, now {{commanded}} by Lasky, and the UNSC home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a nuclear warhead. Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a slipspace portal generated underneath the Composer. The Master Chief activates the bomb but is saved by Cortana, who sacrifices herself. The Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back <b>to</b> <b>Infinity,</b> where he, mourning the loss of Cortana, talks with Lasky about Earth, humanity, and what his duty as a soldier means.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges <b>to</b> <b>infinity</b> as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out <b>to</b> <b>infinity.</b> In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E

30|$|Since φ(x-ct)=ϕ(x-ct)+k is {{a solitary}} {{traveling}} wave solution tending <b>to</b> k at <b>infinity</b> of (1.1), then ϕ(x-ct) is the solitary wave approaching zero of (2.1). Conversely, if v(x,t)∈ C([0,T),H^ 2 (R)) {{is a solution}} of (2.1), then u(x,t)=v(x,t)+k is the solution tending <b>to</b> k at <b>infinity</b> <b>to</b> (1.1).|$|R
50|$|The early formulators of QED {{and other}} quantum field {{theories}} were, as a rule, dissatisfied with {{this state of}} affairs. It seemed illegitimate to do something tantamount <b>to</b> subtracting <b>infinities</b> from <b>infinities</b> <b>to</b> get finite answers.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, in May 2014, she parted ways with her record label Def Jam Recordings, her {{publicist}} Cindi Berger and her manager Jermaine Dupri. She signed a new record contract with L.A. Reid at Epic Records (who co-executively produced Carey's tenth album The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005), sought a new publicist with Chris Chambers of the Chamber Group and hired new managers Stella Bulochnikov and Brian Sher. Writers Shirley Halperin and Andrew Hampp of Billboard attributed Carey's decision to seek new a new label and management to the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse, which at a total of 117,000 units since its release, is Carey's lowest selling album in the United States. Carey secured a multi-album record deal with Epic in January 2015, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment, meaning that #1 <b>to</b> <b>Infinity</b> would be her first album since her seventh studio album Rainbow in 1999 to be released with Sony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent <b>to</b> <b>infinity</b> under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
