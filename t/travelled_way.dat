40|$|Crash {{cushions}} {{are deployed}} at gores {{and in front}} of other fixed objects along the roadway when their proximity to the <b>travelled</b> <b>way</b> poses an unacceptable risk to the travelling public. A crash cushion is intended to act as a deformable shield that causes an errant vehicle to decelerate more slowly, dramatically reducing the potential severity of injuries suffered by vehicle occupants. This paper formulates the design of such a system as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using contemporary search techniques implemented in commercial software. The methodology is demonstrated on high-molecular-weight, high-density polyethylene (HMW/HDPE) cylinders arrayed in a single line to form a crash cushion which carries the trade name REACT? 350 system. The wall thickness of each cylinder in the array is treated as a design variable. The diameter of the cylinders and the total number in the array are treated as parameters and not directly addressed by the optimization process. A simple one dimensional array of masses and nonlinear springs are used to simulate the dynamic interaction of a vehicle and the cushion system and yield a value for the Occupant Impact Velocity (OVI) and Ride Down Acceleration (RDA) for a given set of cylinder parameters. Prescribed upper limits on OVI and RDA under impact of two standard mass vehicles form the four implicit, nonlinear constraints in the problem. The objective function to be minimized is the total weight of the barrels used over all cylinders in the system. Optimization results are presented for one REACT? system reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Run-off {{road and}} head-on crashes {{together}} constitute around 38 % of all casualty crashes {{and a higher}} proportion (closer to 50 %) of all fatality crashes in Queensland, Australia. These statistics are a fair reflection of the national condition. Vehicles leaving the <b>travelled</b> <b>way</b> are a significant contributor to Australian road trauma. The Australian National Road Safety Strategy proposes a number of infrastructure treatments for tackling these two crash types, {{including the use of}} an appropriate road safety barrier. Road authorities deploy longitudinal road safety barriers primarily to prevent errant vehicles from impacting with hazardous roadside objects that could cause an adverse outcome for either the occupants of the errant vehicle or third parties. However, road safety barriers are not equal and are differentiated in the first instance by their capacity to contain impacts of different speed, mass and angle of incidence. While roadway departure speeds and departure angles are well-addressed in contemporary academic literature and methodologies for road safety barrier selection, the mass-distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet is less well represented. This study proposes the use of data obtained from weigh-in-motion technology to represent the mass-frequency distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet. Combined with roadway departures conditions reported by others, a methodology is presented for calculating the likelihood of vehicle-barrier impact exceeding the road safety barrier capacities prescribed by the predominant global test protocols for road safety barriers. The methodology is used to consider how different roadway configurations and traffic compositions might influence the likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance. The results from modelling of various scenarios are reported. The results suggest that the relative likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance varies as a function of cross-sectional geometry as well as traffic composition, so suggesting that a “one-size fits all” approach to road safety barrier selection is not appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Side {{friction}} {{factors are}} defined as all those actions related to the activities taking place by {{the sides of the}} road and sometimes within the road, which interfere with the traffic flow on the <b>travelled</b> <b>way.</b> They include but not limited to pedestrians, bicycles, non-motorised vehicles, parked and stopping vehicles. These factors are normally very frequent in densely populated areas in developing countries, while they are random and sparse in developed countries making it of less interest for research and consequently there is comparatively little literature about them. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the effect of these factors on traffic performance measures on urban roads. To carry out this work, a research design was formulated including specific methods and prescribed limitations. An empirical case study methodology was adopted where Dar-es-salaam city in Tanzania was chosen as a representative case. The scope was limited to include only road-link facilities. A sample of these facilities including two-lane two-way and four-lane two-way roads were selected and studied. The study was conducted in two parts, of which each involved a distinctive approach. Part one involved a macroscopic approach where traffic and friction data were collected and analyzed at an aggregated level, whereas part two involved a microscopic approach where data of individual frictional elements were collected and analysed individually. Data collection was mainly performed by application of video method, which proved to be effective for simultaneous collection of traffic and side friction data. Data reduction was conducted chiefly by computer, using standard spreadsheet and statistical software packages, mainly SPSS and some computer macros. The analysis part was based on statistical methods, chiefly regression analysis. In the macroscopic approach, traffic and friction data from all sites were adjusted through a process called ‘normalization’, which enabled the data from the different sites to be merged, and consequently to obtain speed-flow curves for each road type. The individual friction factors through regression analysis were weighted and combined into one unit of measure of friction called "FRIC". The effect of "FRIC" on speed-flow curves was analyzed. The results showed significant impact on speed for both road types. Impact on capacity was identified on two-lane two-way roads while field data on four-lane two-way roads did not allow this. In the microanalysis approach, effect of individual side friction factors on speed was analyzed. The results showed that on two-lane two-way roads, all studied factors exhibited statistically significant impact on speed, while on four-lane two-way roads, only one factor showed the same. The results also identified impact values characteristic to the individual friction factors on some roads. Recommendations were made based on these results that highway capacity studies particularly in developing countries, should include the friction variable, though in the form suitable to their own particular circumstances. Further recommendations were made that these results should be applied to formulate management programs seeking to limit levels of side friction on high mobility urban arterial streets in order to improve traffic safety and operation efficiency.

40|$|Road {{barriers}} {{have been}} used as an effective countermeasure to prevent exposure of errant vehicles to both vehicles travelling in the opposite direction and to roadside hazards. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in-service safety performance of three types of road barriers (concrete barriers, steel W-beam guardrails, and high-tension cable barriers) in Indiana using cross-sectional analysis based on crash data. The quantitative evaluation was comprised of three components: 1) the effect of the road, barrier scenarios, and traffic on the barrier-relevant (BR) crash frequency, 2) the effect of the road and the barrier scenarios on the BR harmful events, and 3) the effect of the BR events and other conditions on the injury outcomes. The introduction of the BR harmful events linked the crash onset with its outcome. The three developed statistical models were connected through their inputs-outputs and followed the sequence of various BR events during the BR crash. This improvement allowed a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the barriers’ safety effects and a more efficient use of data. The injury outcomes were estimated for all the individuals in a crash rather than for the most severe outcome of a crash. Further improvement of the cost estimates was accomplished by utilizing hospital data. For median barriers, this study found that the total number of BR crashes was higher with the use of median barriers, mostly due to the introduction of collisions with barriers and an increase in the collisions after redirecting vehicles back to traffic. These undesirable effects of barriers were surpassed by the positive results of reducing hazardous events such as cross-median crashes, rollover events, and collisions with roadside hazards, which substantially reduced the number of severe injuries and fatalities. The average (unit) crash costs were estimated for roads without barriers and for roads with various barrier scenarios. The crash costs were reduced by 50 % where cable barriers were in medians wider than 50 feet and where concrete barriers or guardrails were in medians less than or equal to 50 feet wide. Roadside barriers (guardrails) reduced the unit crash costs by 20 % to 30 %. Median cable barriers were found to be the most effective among all the studied barriers due to the smallest increase in the crash frequency and least severe injuries in barrier-relevant crashes. A cable barrier’s offset to the <b>travelled</b> <b>way</b> was also investigated in this study. When considering vehicles moving in one direction, the nearside cable barriers installed at an offset less than or equal to 30 feet performed better than far-side cable barriers with a larger offsets thanks to the better protection they provide for vehicles against rollovers in the median and impact with the median drain. Consequently, the biggest safety benefit can be expected where cables barriers are installed in the median at both edges. The results were implemented through a set of crash modification factors and unit crash costs estimated for 51 road-barrier scenarios. An implementation procedure is provided to quantify the crash costs and the safety benefits for these scenarios...|$|E
