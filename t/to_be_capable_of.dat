5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO {{would be able to}} switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining {{authorization}} for its 'eight-eight battlefleet'. The , authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns like their American counterparts. The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships {{and two more}} battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the , were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the , also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the USNavy's Lexington-class battlecruisers.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{research}} {{has continued to}} illuminate {{the complexity of the}} lemur mind, with emphasis on the cognitive abilities of the ring-tailed lemur. As early as the mid-1970s, studies had demonstrated that they could be trained through operant conditioning using standard schedules of reinforcement. The species has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> learning pattern, brightness and object discrimination, skills common among vertebrates. The ring-tailed lemur has also been shown to learn a variety of complex tasks often equaling, if not exceeding, the performance of simians.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} {{in response to}} NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. According to the NATO requirement, the new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, it was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> penetrating body armor. FN Herstal responded to the NATO requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm cartridge and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.|$|E

Although intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> flying at transonic speeds, the CF-103 only proffered a moderate increase in performance and capability over the CF-100; subsequently, the aircraft never progressed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s the Japanese {{government}} {{adopted an}} ultranationalist militancy {{with a view}} to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited {{the positive or negative}} electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{established}} the Territorial Force, which replaced the outdated and recently disbanded Volunteer Force. He organised {{the structure of}} the New Zealand Military Forces into four military districts, with each district <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> raising an infantry and a mounted brigade. The districts had a specified number of battalions and regiments organised {{along the lines of the}} British Army. He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps to train and administer the Territorial Force. The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator {{were collected in}} his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E

The authors said the person holding the device would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned {{to generate electricity}} for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries {{in the form of}} steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 to be drawn up was the high-bypass turbofan engine. The engine technology was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, at first aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

The ships were authorized in 1875, with funding allocated to begin construction the following year. They were faster and more seaworthy than the preceding Caio Duilio class, owing to their higher freeboard. Brin intended them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> fighting successfully against any foreign warship in service, and so he opted for very large guns for the main battery.|$|E
