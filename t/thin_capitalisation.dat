40|$|The {{opportunities}} for international tax avoidance through the shifting of profits between jurisdictions is increasing as the world’s economy becomes more integrated. While transfer pricing {{has been the}} primary method for multinationals to shift profits, <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> arrangements have been seen by some multinationals as an alternative as transfer pricing practices have become subject to greater scrutiny by revenue authorities. As a result many OECD members have {{over the last decade}} introduced specific rules to deal with <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> arrangements.

40|$|In October 2015, the OECD made a best {{practice}} recommendation in Action 4 of its BEPS project, suggesting a Fixed Ratio Rule {{in place of}} <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules. This review was almost 3 decades in the making, with the most recent OECD report on <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules published in 1986, which omitted guidance on how these rules could best be designed. <b>Thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules’ strong emphasis on revenue base protection has resulted in their exponentially increasing popularity internationally since the 1960 ’s. However, {{there is a growing}} body of literature critiquing the effectiveness of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules. Accordingly, this paper approaches the issue of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> from a novel perspective by conceptualising the cross-border debt bias as the ‘disease’ and <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> as merely the ‘symptom’. Grounded in the tax principle of efficiency, the overarching question guiding this paper is whether, given the opportunity to ‘start over’, the tax-induced cross-border debt bias would be better addressed by retaining <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules in their current form or whether an alternative reform would be more suited to dealing with this ‘disease’. The optimisation model developed in this paper shows that the OECD’s Fixed Ratio Rule is more effective than the current regime of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules at protecting the tax revenue base from the most tax-aggressive MNEs. However, the model also indicates that it is ultimately more effective to align the tax treatment of intercompany funding to eliminate the ‘underlying disease’ (the tax incentive for <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation),</b> rather than adopting rules that mitigate the ‘symptom’ (such as the OECD’s Fixed Ratio Rule). This research presents a unique contribution to the literature by simulating complex cross-border intercompany tax planning strategies.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} trends in the evolution of global tax systems has been the rise from relative obscurity of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules, which are perceived as anti-avoidance rules which limit tax base erosion from cross-border interest deductions. However, over the same timeframe, innovations to financial instruments have challenged the traditional financial and legal distinctions between debt and equity, which in the cross-border setting has exposed the prevalence of economic inefficiencies {{in the design of the}} international tax system. This paper approaches the issue of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> from a novel perspective by conceptualising the cross-border debt bias as the ‘disease’ and <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> as merely the ‘symptom’. Despite their prevalence, it is unclear whether <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules: (1) attain tax neutrality (specifically, do these rules mitigate the debt bias); (2) are effective in both theory and practice.

Accordingly, this paper: (1) considers reforms traditionally designed to address the domestic debt bias; specifically, the allowance for corporate equity (ACE), comprehensive business income tax (CBIT), combined ACE-CBIT and allowance for corporate capital; (2) examines the literature and implementation experience of the ACE, the only one of these fundamental reforms which has been experimented with in practice, to consider whether it is effective in both theory and practice; (3) presents the possibility of extending the combined ACE-CBIT to the cross-border context as an alternative to <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules...|$|E

40|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> {{rules are}} widely {{perceived}} as an anti-avoidance mechanism that limit tax base erosion from cross-border intercompany activities. Despite this perception, the legal basis for these rules does not reconcile with the economic basis, because these complex and ad-hoc rules present only imperfect {{solutions to the problem}} of the debt bias. The economic literature generally assumes that a fundamental reform eliminating the debt bias would also eliminate the need for <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules. However, the current paradigm of the debt/equity all-or-nothing approach overlooks the fungibility of intercompany capital flows. Accordingly, this thesis introduces the concept of cross-border funding neutrality, which is utilised in conjunction with other criteria as a rubric for the subsequent practical- and conceptual-level analysis. In doing so, this reform-orientated thesis bridges the gap between pure economic theory, practical optimisation modelling and applied legal research. This research consists of both a legal comparative analysis featuring case studies of the Belgian and Italian ACE-variants and the Australian <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules, as well as a simulation analysis of a tax-minimising multinational enterprises behavioural responses to existing and proposed tax regimes. By simulating cross-border intercompany tax planning scenarios the model developed makes the invisible visible. This leads to the novel finding that, in order to minimise opportunities for cross-border tax planning by MNEs, it is necessary for governments to equalise the tax treatment of fungible intercompany funding activities. Even though obtaining full tax neutrality is nearly impossible without international tax coordination, the measures proposed and tested in this thesis provide second-best alternatives that may be more effective at eliminating opportunities for cross-border tax planning than existing policy responses  even when applied unilaterally. This dissertation makes a significant contribution to both tax law and policy analysis. The challenge it presents to conventional understandings of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules, and the tax treatment of cross-border intercompany activities in general, reveals new insights into the importance of applying economic first-principles in tax design.

40|$|In {{response}} to Australia’s decision to adopt international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) from 2005, New Zealand has subsequently decided to follow. New Zealand reporting entities {{are required to}} adopt IFRSs from 2007 with the option of early adoption from 2005. As New Zealand {{is one of many}} jurisdictions where different rules are employed to determine income for financial reporting and tax purposes, it would seem to a casual observer that the adoption of IFRSs in New Zealand is unlikely to have any income tax implications for New Zealand companies. This is not entirely correct. There are links between financial reporting standards and the determination of taxable income under New Zealand income tax law in respect of certain matters. One such area is the application of the New Zealand <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules in subpart FG of the Income Tax Act 2004.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Base erosion in {{the form}} of profit {{shifting}} has become an increasing concern internationally as well as in South Africa. A significant type of base erosion in South Africa is {{in the form}} of excessive interest deductions where income is effectively shifted to a no-tax or low-tax jurisdiction. One of the key developments affecting the South African tax laws was the introduction of provisions that target base erosion and profit shifting. Included in these provisions is section 23 M, which limits the deduction of interest paid to persons in whose hands the interest received is not subject to tax in South Africa. It was, however, identified that section 23 M may target the same interest risks that the new section 31 <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> provisions address. Section 23 M was said to be the enactment of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation.</b> Although one of the purposes of tax treaties is to encourage international trade and investment, there is also discriminatory taxation, which runs counter to that purpose and therefore the prevention of such discrimination is important when dealing with tax treaties. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Model Tax Convention contains a handful of special criteria in article 24, which must not lead to different or less favourable treatment with regard to taxation. It was found that the non-discrimination article, in particular articles 24 (4) and 24 (5), may prevent the application of a <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> regime if the provisions are in contrast with the OECD non-discrimination provisions. Article 24 (4) and article 24 (5), however, contain an exception that the non-discrimination provisions would not be applicable provided that the <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> regimes are compatible with the arm’s length principles of article 9. If section 23 M was therefore found to be an arm’s length transaction, the article 24 (4) and (5) non-discrimination provisions would without further consideration, not be applicable. It was, however, found that section 23 M does not consider the factors that should be considered when an arm’s length transaction is applicable, but merely applies the same formula to each company regardless of the size of the company or the industry sector. As a result of this, it appears as if section 23 M is arbitrary in nature and therefore would not represent an arm’s length transaction. The exception would not be applicable and would therefore increase the potential non-compliance with the non-discrimination provision. The objective of this study was to determine whether any aspect of section 23 M would be contrary to the OECD guidelines relevant to <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> and in particular the non-discrimination provisions. It was, however, found that although it appears as if section 23 M’s primary focus is on cross-border transactions, the provisions do not directly discriminate on the basis of residence. As a result of the discrimination being indirect discrimination and the fact that the cause of section 23 M being applicable is not foreign ownership, but rather due to the creditor not being subject to tax, it was concluded that the OECD non-discrimination provisions would not be applicable to section 23 M.

40|$|South Africa, {{together}} with similar countries world-wide, has taken active steps {{to counter the}} negative effects of the concept of “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” by tightening its transfer pricing legislation. The South African 2010 Taxation Laws Amendment Act includes certain changes to bring the transfer pricing rules contained under section 31 of the Income Tax Act no 58 of 1962 up to date. These changes are aimed at bringing the South African transfer pricing legislation in line with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The new section 31 is aimed at shifting focus from the old transaction-based wording, to a more substance-focused approach. This implies, therefore, that safe harbours will no longer be the main determinant in establishing whether or not a company is thinly capitalised. The major concerns raised by taxpayers regarding this new approach relate to the uncertainties with regard to its practical application. Thus, the new amendments have brought about various challenges, including, the standardisation of procedures, reducing the cost of compliance, and developing broad databases that can assist with the determination of the arm's length price. This study aims to analyse the practical difficulties with which taxpayers could be faced in the application of this new legislation. The study uses the United Kingdom to assess the effectiveness of the new <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules since their <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> provisions also appear to have been brought in line with the OECD guidelines.

40|$|This thesis {{answers the}} {{question}} “How does {{the application of}} the Swedish adjustment rule correspond to the OECD point of view regarding intragroup loans to thinly capitalised companies?” The question is answered by using the traditional legal method and by examining the way the adjustment rule is applied by the Supreme Administrative Court, the Swedish approach when using the arm’s length principle in Swedish law is then compared to the approach recommended by the OECD. From a tax point of view intragroup prices on commodities and services are of vital importance for multinational enterprises, since these prices in the end affects the total corporate taxation. Also the way of financing a company can have tax implications since it could be an advantage for an MNE to arrange financing of companies within the group through loans rather than contribution of equity capital. A company with a disproportionate debt to equity ratio is considered thinly capitalised and since interest payments are considered deductible expenses, which dividends are not, it provides a way to transfer untaxed profits within a group. This may be an incentive for MNEs to intentionally thinly capitalise companies by providing them with capital through loans instead of equity contributions. The Swedish provision regulating transfer pricing between associated enterprises is the adjustment rule which expresses the arm’s length principle. The purpose of the rule is to adjust erroneous pricing between associated enterprises and it has four requisites that have to be fulfilled in order to be applicable. In the thesis it is concluded that nothing in the preambles to the adjustment rule points at the provision being applicable to <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation,</b> on the contrary they indicate that it should have a narrow application. Through case law it has been established that the adjustment rule is not applicable to <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> situations {{in the sense that it}} can not be used to reclassify a loan into equity contribution. The provision is, in such a situation, only applicable to adjust interest rates that deviate from rates on the open market. The arm’s length principle expressed in article 9. 1 of the OECD Model Tax Convention however seems to have a broader application than the adjustment rule. It is stated in the commentary to the article that it may be applied to prima facie loans, i. e. it can reclassify a loan into equity contribution if the surrounding circumstances points at it being the true nature of the transaction. The conclusions drawn when comparing the reasoning of the Supreme Administrative Court with the OECD regarding {{the application of the}} arm’s length principle, is that the way the OECD reason regarding the true nature of a transaction is based on the same idea as the reasoning of the Swedish court. The Swedish Supreme Court however uses this type of reasoning when applying the substance over form principle and not when applying the adjustment rule. In other words, the difference is that the adjustment rule is not acknowledged the same scope of application as article 9. 1. Regarding the need to legislate against <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> in Sweden it is the authors’ opinion that since no examination of the problem has been performed, it is necessary to examine whether <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> in reality constitutes a problem for the Swedish revenue. Not until it is established if a problem exists should there be a discussion regarding the construction of such a provision...|$|E
40|$|The high {{marginal}} {{tax rate}} of 78 per cent in the Norwegian petroleum sector gives the petroleum companies a strong incentive to finance themselves by both {{external and internal}} debt. This can lead to situations where the companies are financed largely by debt relative to equity, {{also referred to as}} <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation.</b> Because the interest expense on debt is tax deductible, extensive use of debt reduces the petroleum companies’ taxable income substantially. As the tax from the petroleum sector accounts for over half of the Norwegian State’s total revenue from the petroleum sector, different rules have over time been put in place to reduce the problem of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation.</b> There have been three different thin-capitalisation rule regimes with the first one being introduced in 1994. In this thesis, we elaborate on the three regimes and develop three corresponding theoretical models that describe the petroleum companies’ optimal capital structure under each regime. We find that under the 1994 regime, the derived optimal capital structure implied that all companies should have a debt-to-asset ratio of at least the defined threshold using both external and internal debt. After the introduction of the second regime in 2002, we find that petroleum companies should have either the same capital structure as under the 1994 regime, or decrease leverage to below the threshold if the net gain of exceeding the threshold was insufficiently large. Finally, we find that under the current 2007 regime, the optimal capital structure is qualitatively similar, but not equal, to the 2002 regime. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, we present some empirical observations showing that the total-debt-to-asset ratio has increased significantly since 1993 and converges to 90 per cent by 2007.

It is shown that the Court’s focus upon removing discriminatory obstacles to the fundamental freedoms does not necessarily lead to a more level playing field and increased tax neutrality, an instrumental objective towards attaining a European Internal Market. In order to assess whether the jurisprudence of the Court does indeed attain increased neutrality or level playing field, two rulings are used as case studies. The first ruling in Lankhorst-Hohorst regards the compatibility of <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> with free movement provisions; the second in Marks & Spencer concerns the compatibility of rules on group consolidation with those same provisions. An economic analysis demonstrates that, depending on the reaction of Member States to the ruling, tax induced differences in capital costs faced by firms operating within the European Internal Market may increase, whilst GDP and welfare may decrease. Consideration of actual legislative amendments introduced to <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules by Member States following Lankhorst-Hohorst, and to group consolidation rules following Marks & Spencer, appear to indicate that it is this negative scenario which has prevailed.

In particular, it reflects on whether the Court’s actions can be regarded as ultra vires, and whether they may constitute a violation of the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers.

It is applied as a procedure for the inspection and measurement of the likely benefits, costs and effects of a new or existing legal regime. It should support the policy-making process by contributing valuable empirical data {{in the context of}} a broader decision-making framework and thus enable decision makers to study the consequences of any regulatory policy options. The paper analyses the developmental stage of RIA procedures for tax policy in Slovenia while the literature shows that it is used more on declaratory level. On the basis of quantitative and qualitative ex-post economic analysis of the tax instrument (thin-capitalisation), the paper proves that the procedure is not sophisticated enough to facilitate efficient and effective regulation in terms of economic and legal elements. regulatory {{impact assessment}}; RIA; regulatory procedures; multinational corporations; MNCs; multinationals; tax policy; Slovenia; <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rule; administrative costs; regulatory effectiveness; regulations; tax legislation...|$|E
40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{significant}} changes to Australia’s tax rules were those proposed {{by the government in}} this year’s budget as part of its response to the Global Financial crisis. Among the announced changes, superannuation contribution concessions have been halved, there are to be new private health insurance tiers, the s 26 AG exemption for resident taxpayers will be limited to aid workers and some government employees, the <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules are to change, the government proposes to improve the tax treatment of off-market share buy-backs, the foreign source income attribution regime is to be reformed, and the R&D concession is {{to be replaced by a}} new R&D credit. The Courts and the ATO have also been active and there have been a number of new cases and new and revised rulings – all of which have impacted on the law in varying degrees. This paper will look at some of those changes – either because of the way in which they have changed (or reinforced) our understanding of the law or, in some cases, just because of their quirkiness. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{has been}} {{supporting}} {{a transition from}} a system of separate accounting {{to a system of}} formula apportionment. In 2011, it presented a proposal for a council directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). Formula apportionment is often considered more resistant to profit shifting and assumed to reduce compliance costs. We use a dynamic model of tax accounting based on neoclassical investment theory and effective tax rates to determine whether, and to what extent, formula apportionment mitigates the efficiency of typical profit-shifting measures. We focus on the roles of transfer pricing and intragroup debt financing (through loans and leases) under both separate accounting and formula apportionment. Our results show that instead of eliminating tax planning strategies, the proposed system will simply induce a shift from manipulating reported profits to influencing the apportionment key. Inside the European Union, the CCCTB may be able to render <b>thin</b> <b>capitalisation</b> rules and transfer pricing documentation redundant. However, formula apportionment invites new forms of tax planning involving manipulating the book value of assets rather than profit shifting...|$|E
