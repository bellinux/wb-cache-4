5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire pacer Ian Hunter {{continued}} on his good form {{from the last}} Championship match, where he took five for 63 against Durham, as he removed Leicestershire opener John Maunders for 0 in the second over of the match at Grace Road. That {{was as good as}} it got for Hunter and Durham, though, as Darren Robinson and Tom New accumulated 217 for the second wicket in four and a half hours, as Leicestershire went from 4 for 1 to 221 for 2. Nevertheless, one and a half days of lost play prevented them from forcing a victory. HD Ackerman, Dinesh Mongia and Paul Nixon also passed fifty in the first innings, as Leicestershire declared having made 552 for 6.

25|$|Nephté {{was first}} {{performed}} at the Académie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opéra) on 15 December 1789. The young soprano Madame Maillard took the title role, replacing Lemoyne's protegée Antoinette Saint-Huberty. According to some sources, the premiere was so successful, Lemoyne was called onto the stage after the final curtain, {{the first time this}} had happened {{in the history of the}} Opéra. Nephté ran for 39 performances, the last given on 18 March 1792. Hoffman angrily claimed that the withdrawal of the work was to prevent him receiving the pension which would have been his due had it reached 40 performances. In support of Hoffman's argumemnt is the fact that the season did not end until 27 March, allowing <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> staging. Hoffman had also dedicated the libretto to Antoinette Saint-Huberty, who was disliked by the Opéra management, and had refused to add dance divertissements to Nephté on artistic grounds, against the recommendations of the Opéra board. On the other hand, ticket receipts had recently been falling off as the opera was losing popularity in spite of the good press it enjoyed.|$|E
500|$|Gaga co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] with Parker and Ronson, with {{additional}} production from BloodPop.

They met up in Malibu and completed [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] within {{the first few days of}} their recording sessions. According to BloodPop, there was no conversation about what the song should sound like, they [...] "all kind of spoke a similar language". The track's arrangement was done by Ronson who played synths and guitar with Parker. They were joined by Josh Homme on the guitar, while BloodPop developed the rhythm and synthesis, alongside Parker playing drums. Ronson and BloodPop's production were bridged together through Parker's use of Ableton.|$|E
500|$|In the Rolling Bootlegs, set in 1930, Isaac and Miria {{decide to}} visit Manhattan. When {{attempting}} to buy several disguises, they briefly meet Camorristi Firo Prochainezo and Maiza Avaro and befriend the homunculus [...] Ennis, instilling her with confidence and hope. They decide to rob {{the very small}} Martillo and Gandor families. The pair sneak into the Martillo's speakeasy, the Alveare, to scout the area, and while {{they are in the}} storage room, Isaac is nearly killed by a ceremonial gunshot from Firo's caporegime inauguration downstairs. Firo and Maiza respond to Miria's scream for help, and the couple are invited to the celebration as an apology. Shortly afterward, they leave to investigate the Gandor headquarters. Believing it contains money, they steal a box. However, they find a bottle of immortality elixir inside, which they mistake for alcohol. Disappointed there is no money, they give the bottle to the Martillo thank them for their kindness. This prompts the immortal Szilard Quates, who owns the elixir and created Ennis, to attack the Alveare to retrieve the elixir. He orders Ennis to kill Isaac and Miria, but she attacks Szilard instead. When he is about to kill her, Isaac and Miria defend her, buying enough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> immortal to devour Szilard, the only way to kill an immortal. It is later discovered that the immortality elixir was not in the bottle the duo stole. Firo, not realizing what it was, had stolen it earlier and distributed it at the celebration, bestowing immortality and eternal youth on all the guests, including Isaac and Miria. In the anime series, the bottle the pair stole is truly the immortality elixir and they inadvertently distribute it at the party as a gesture of thanks toward the Martillo. Afterward, the two travel to California and search for gold.|$|E

Vengeance and three other battleships covered Albion inside the straits. The ships quickly silenced the Ottoman guns at Dardanus, but mobile artillery batteries continually forced both Albion and Queen Elizabeth to shift position, largely preventing the latter from firing and the former from relaying corrections for the few shots Queen Elizabeth had been able to make.
