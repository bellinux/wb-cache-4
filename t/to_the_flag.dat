5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors {{influenced the}} design of the Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic rings. The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.|$|E
5|$|Display and {{usage of}} the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flag</b> Code– India, the {{original}} flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate {{the provisions of the}} Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.|$|E

5|$|Following the lyrics, {{the second}} video {{starts with the}} quartet {{in the front of}} the aeroplane, with Spencer as the captain. The video {{continues}} with all of the members as stewards walking up and down the plane, with a cameo appearance from Sister Mary McArthur, who was invited to take part after the band saw her lip sync video. Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Several Muslim {{countries}} {{along the}} south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used a red flag similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of the Ottoman Empire. After {{the destruction of the}} Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create a flag to use for the fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag's adoption, as the government states that it was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan's Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World claim that it was adopted in 1835.|$|E
5|$|Singaporeans are {{encouraged}} to display the national flag outside their homes during National Day celebrations, and residents' committees, particularly those of public housing estates, often arrange co-ordinated displays. However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, {{without the need for}} the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flag.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flag</b> is {{extremely}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flags</b> of <b>the</b> Baath Party, Jordan, Palestine, and the Arab Federation {{all of which}} draw their inspiration from the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule (1916-1918). Prior <b>to</b> being <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Palestine, it was <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of <b>the</b> short lived Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan. <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> of <b>the</b> Arab Revolt had the same graphic form, but the colours were arranged differently (white on the bottom, {{rather than in the}} middle).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{national}} <b>flag</b> {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flags</b> of Ghana and Togo, in its {{incorporation of the}} colour red, along with its symbolism of the fight for independence.|$|R
50|$|From 1815 <b>to</b> 1818, <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Lucca was {{yellow and}} red {{horizontal}} stripes. From 7 November 1818, <b>to</b> 1847 <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> was white, with Maria Luisa's coat of arms and <b>the</b> yellow-red <b>flag</b> in <b>the</b> canton.|$|R
5|$|The {{flags of}} Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> {{of the nation}} of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the {{short-lived}} republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by the flag of the First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. The flag of the Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The {{state flag}} of Washington {{consists}} of the state seal, displaying an image of state namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the only U.S. state flag with a field of green {{as well as the}} only state flag with the image of an American president. The Secretary of State regulates flag protocol related to the state flag, as well approving replica flags for commercial sale and other standards related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> staff and hauled it up to the top. The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|On June 22, 2015, Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley {{called for}} <b>the</b> <b>flag's</b> removal from state house grounds. In the {{following}} weeks before <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, {{were arrested for}} removing or attempting <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. <b>The</b> attempts <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> were criticized by several S.C. State legislators who supported <b>the</b> <b>flag's</b> removal because they said such actions could hurt their goal <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> permanently removed.|$|R
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flag</b> Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s, the {{official}} State Flag of Georgia {{had been a}} center of controversy as it incorporated the historic Confederate flag dating to the American Civil War, which among some people is thought to symbolize resistance to cultural changes in the state. After 2001 changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> which removed this, Governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, who had led the flag-redesign effort, was defeated for re-election; many {{thought it was the}} result of the political backlash. The 1956 version with the Confederate States of America battle emblem, known as a St.Andrew's cross, was a continuing topic of debate for southern heritage proponents. Reed served as one of Governor Sonny Perdue's floor leaders in debates that led to the ratification of the current (2003) version of the state flag.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag),</b> men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E
25|$|The Coalition {{government}} under John Howard in 1996 formally recognised the commemoration of Australian National Flag Day, in 1998 sponsored an amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flags</b> Act <b>to</b> require any changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national <b>flag</b> design <b>to</b> be passed at a plebiscite {{along the same}} lines of the 1977 national song poll, in 2002 supplied ANFA's promotional video free to all primary schools and in 2004 required all schools receiving federal funds <b>to</b> fly <b>the</b> Australian <b>flag.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>flag</b> of <b>the</b> British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flags</b> of other British {{dependencies}} and colonies {{as it has}} <b>the</b> Union <b>Flag</b> in <b>the</b> upper hoist-side corner. The palm tree and crown are symbols of the Indian Ocean Territory.|$|R
50|$|Azaryan {{was also}} <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> bearer for Armenia at the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics {{and is the}} third and fourth ever Olympian <b>to</b> bear <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Armenia at the Summer Olympics. He also became <b>the</b> first <b>flag</b> bearer <b>to</b> bear <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Armenia twice. Azaryan was {{originally}} intended <b>to</b> also bear <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Armenia at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the decision was substantiated due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> age of Azaryan.|$|R
5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag,</b> it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
