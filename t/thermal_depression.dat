50|$|The summer mistral, {{unlike the}} others, {{is created by}} purely local conditions. It usually happens in July, and only in {{the valley of the}} Rhone and on the coast of Provence. It is caused by a <b>thermal</b> <b>depression</b> over the {{interior}} of Provence (The Var and Alpes de Haute-Provence), created when the land is overheated. This creates a flow of air from the north toward the east of Provence. This wind is frequently cancelled out close to the coast by the breezes from the sea. It does not blow for more than a single day, but it is feared in Provence, because it dries the vegetation and it can spread forest fires.|$|E
40|$|Statement of the problem. Despite a {{relative}} rarity of fires in underground tunnels, their conse-quence, as a rule, are rather tragic. Emergency {{operation of a}} system of tunnel ventilation should provide, first of all, a reliable removal of products of burning (smoke and fire gases), preventing them from occurring on routes of evacuation of passengers. Calculation dependencies for defining the stress parameters of tunnels should consider a variety of schemes of ventilating connections of compromise jointss, various conditions of their formation, a possible location of a fire and a prospective direction of smoke removal. Results and conclusions. The effectiveness {{of a system of}} smoke removal, providing evacuation of passengers at rolling stock burning in a tunnel and including calculation of stress parameters of ventilation of tunnels and thermal factors of a fire which are formed during the operation of a system of tunnel ventilation of undergrounds in the smoke removal mode was evaluated.

In the three-spin chain, besides the XX-type nearest-neighbor two-spin interaction, a multi-spin interaction is also considered and a homogenous magnetic field {{is applied to}} each spin. We show that the extreme steady-state quantum discord and entanglement of the two end spins can always be created by holding both a large magnetic field and a strong multi-spin interaction. The results are explained by the <b>thermal</b> excitation <b>depression</b> due to switching a large energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state.

The {{results show that the}} extreme winter circulation anomaly in the northwestern Pacific exhibits a strong association with those appearing in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere including the northern Asian continent, part of the Barents Sea, and the northeastern Pacific. As the season progresses, an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly appearing in the northwestern Pacific gradually moves northeastwards and extends westwards. Its axis in the west-east direction is also stretched. Therefore, easterly (westerly) anomalies {{in the southern part of}} the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly continuously expand westwards to the peninsula of India. Therefore, the South Asian summer monsoon would be weaker (stronger). Simultaneously, another interesting phenomenon is the evolution of SLP anomalies.

40|$|International audienceThe Saharan {{heat low}} (SHL) {{is defined as}} a {{stationary}} <b>thermal</b> <b>depression</b> below 700 [*]hPa located over the Sahara during the boreal summer season. This feature has {{a significant impact on the}} seasonal and intra-seasonal variability of rainfall over the Sahel. For various reasons, few observations are assimilated in operational numerical weather prediction models, especially surface sensitive observations. In this study we make use of the advanced microwave sounding unit (AMSU-A) brightness temperatures measured at 52. 8 [*]GHz (noted A 4 hereafter) and at 53. 6 [*]GHz (noted A 5 hereafter) to detect the heat low and to characterize its intensity at the seasonal and intra-seasonal scales. In terms of seasonal variability, AMSU-based estimates of SHL are found in good agreement with those based on the European Center Medium-range Weather Forecast ERA-I reanalyses for the period ranging from 2000 to 2011. However, differences exist between the two datasets at intraseasonal timescale. They may be related to mismatches between the numerical weather prediction model levels and the level of maximum of sensitivity of the AMSU observations. Particular meteorological situations can also explain some differences between the two types of products, as there is a lack of assimilated observations in this region. Finally, we show that the A 4 brightness temperature is a suitable proxy to provide a good estimate of the location and the intensity of the SHL from daily to seasonal timescales...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring summer 2006, the {{intensity}} of the <b>thermal</b> <b>depression</b> over the Sahara, derived from European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast analyses, exhibited a strong decrease during the first couple of weeks of September. Simultaneously, widespread convective activity over the Sahel was detected. The aims of this study are to identify the reasons for this decrease of the West African Heat Low (WAHL) activity, to discuss the possible relationship with convection and to assess the representativity of such an event at the climatological time-scale. From spectral analysis of the daily WAHL thickness during summer 2006, two period bands of significant intraseasonal pulsations were identified, and confirmed using the ERA- 40 reanalysis, namely 3 - 10 d and 10 - 30 d. In both the 2006 case-study and the climatological composite study, we find that detrimental conditions in the 3 - 10 d period band are associated with moist and cool advections in the lower troposphere linked to the southerly sector of African easterly waves (AEWs) which increase convective activity over the Sahel. These humid and cold advections from the south are more pronounced when the AEW interacts with a midlatitude depression. In the 10 - 30 d period band, the impact of midlatitude circulation is demonstrated. During the collapsing period of the 10 - 30 d pulsations of the WAHL thickness, an upper-level trough is seen over northern West Africa. This situation generates a surge of 700 hPa cold air from Libya into the Sahara, an increase of the 925 hPa anticyclonic circulation and a significant increase of convective activity over the Sahel...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAntifreeze polypeptides {{from fish}} are {{generally}} thought to inhibit ice crystal growth by specific adsorption onto ice surfaces and preventing addition of water molecules {{to the ice}} lattice. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} this adsorption results from hydrogen bonding through the side chains of polar amino acids as well as hydrophobic interactions between the non-polar domains on the ice-binding side of antifreeze polypeptides and the clathrate-like surfaces of ice. In order to better understand the activity of one of the antifreeze polypeptide families, namely the α-helical type I antifreeze polypeptides, four α-helical peptides having sequences not directly analogous to those of known antifreeze polypeptides and containing only positively charged and non-polar side chains were synthesized. Two peptides with regularly spaced lysine residues, GAAKAAKAAAAAAAKAAKAAAAAAAKAAKAAGGY-NH 2 and GAALKAAKAAAAAALKAAKAAAAAALKAAKAAGGY-NH 2, showed antifreeze activity, albeit weaker than seen in natural antifreeze polypeptides, by the criteria of freezing point <b>depression</b> (<b>thermal</b> hysteresis) and ice crystal modification to a hexagonal trapezohedron. Peptides with irregular spacing of Lys residues were completely inactive. Up to now, lysine residues have not been generally associated with antifreeze activity, though they have been implicated in some antifreeze polypeptides.

40|$|The West African heat low, {{which is}} defined as a <b>thermal</b> <b>depression</b> {{generally}} below 700 hPa over West Africa, is stationary over the Sahara during the summer season and {{is often referred to as}} the Saharan heat low (SHL). This SHL displays synoptic and intra-seasonal pulsations of its intensity on time scales under 60 days. In this study, we analyse the regional-scale pattern of low troposphere dynamics and convective activity associated with weak and strong phases of the SHL during the summer, using 18 years (1984 - 2001) of concomitant European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts re-analysis data and satellite observations of brightness temperature provided by the European Union-funded Cloud Archive User Service. Strong SHL phases, defined by an increase of low-level atmospheric thickness, are accompanied by (1) a positive anomaly of temperature in the low layers, (2) a strengthening of the monsoon flow, (3) both a negative anomaly of the divergence flux and an enhancement of the moisture advection over the central Sahel, (4) an intensification of the African easterly jet and (5) enhanced upward vertical motions located south of the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD). These conditions appear to be favourable for the occurrence of convection over the central Sahel. The strongest, most widespread convective activity over the central and eastern Sahel occurs on the day when the SHL intensity is the strongest. In contrast, a significant decrease of the convective activity was detected over Senegal and to the West of the Jos Plateau. Opposite patterns are found during weak SHL phases, with a negative anomaly of convection over the central and eastern Sahel connected with anomalous subsidence south of the ITD and a negative moisture advection anomaly. Conversely, convection is seen to be enhanced along the Atlantic coast and particularly over Senegal...|$|E

Whilst benefit has been claimed, previous ACAPS reports have provided limited information. Detailed prospective reporting of therapeutic effects and side-effects is required. Objective: To report a prospective study of therapeutic effect, mental status, quality of life, social functioning, and neurocognitive functioning in individuals with chronic treatment-refractory Major Depression, treated with ACAPS. Method: A prospective case series of 20 patients treated by ACAPS between 1992 and 1999 were reassessed at a mean follow-up of 7. 0 ± 3. 4 years. Data were collected preoperatively and at long-term follow-up. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 14 participants. Results: According to a priori criteria, at long-term follow-up, 50 % were classified as 'responders', 40 % as 'remitters'. Fifty-five percent were classified as 'improved'; 35 % were 'unchanged'; and 10 % had 'deteriorated'. Neurocognitive and personality testing {{were not significantly different}} at follow up. A trend towards improvement in some aspects of executive neuropsychological functioning was observed. Significant adverse effects were infrequent and there were no deaths. Conclusions: ACAPS may represent an effective intervention for some patients with chronic, disabling, treatment-refractory Major Depression that has failed to respond to other therapeutic approaches. The adverse effect burden within this population was modest, with no evidence of generalised impairment of neurocognitive functioning...|$|R
40|$|Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) is a binary {{targeted}} therapy that uses suitably designed pharmaceuticals to deliver (superscript 10) B to tumor cells. The region is then irradiated with neutrons and neutron capture by the (superscript 10) B nucleus {{leads to the}} emission of an alpha particle and lithium ion. These have very short ranges similar to the dimensions of a biological cell and therefore the technique could have potential for selective killing of tumour cells. In order to achieve adequate neutron fluxes {{at the site of}} the tumour epithermal (0. 5 eV � 10 s of keV) neutron beams are used. A review of the general details of BNCT is presented in this thesis. This thesis investigates the use of two semiconductor devices for measuring the neutron and gamma dose components involved in epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT. The silicon lattice in PIN diodes undergoes displacement damage when irradiated with neutrons. This leads to a change in the forward bias voltage of the diode that is proportional to the neutron dose received. To verify that the energy dependence of this effect follows the published silicon displacement damage KERMA (Kinetic Energy Released per Mass of Absorber) data measurements were performed using quasi-monoenergetic neutrons obtained from a Van de Graff accelerator (Ansto) in the energy range from 90 keV � 890 keV. These measurements were in agreement with the published data for silicon displacement damage KERMA. A sensitivity factor for the diodes was also derived from these measurements. The thermal neutron sensitivity of the PIN diodes was then determined using the TC- 10 thermal neutron column on the Moata reactor at Ansto. The sensitivity results were in general agreement with the Van de Graff derived sensitivity factor. Since the silicon damage KERMA is not the same as the tissue KERMA function PIN diodes are not intrinsically tissue equivalent. A Monte Carlo (MNCP) ideal beam study was undertaken to see if for some limited energy range tissue dose could be parameterised in terms of silicon damage dose and foil activation. This was found to be approximately true for neutron energies from thermal to 100 keV. Coefficients are given that allow tissue dose to be determined on the basis of a single PIN diode and activation foil measurement in spectra where the maximum neutron energy is 100 keV or less. MOSFETS can be used as gamma radiation dosimeters by measuring the change in threshold voltage (simplistically understood as the potential applied to the gate to initiate current flow from source to drain electrodes) that occurs when they are exposed to radiation. The MOSFETs used in this study were characterised using a Varian 2100 C medical linac beam and low energy x-rays from a superficial x-ray unit. The sensitivity of the MOSFETs was measured with different potentials applied to the gate during irradiation. Depth dose profiles in 6 MV x-ray beams were measured and found to be in good agreement with both ionisation chamber measurements and MCNP simulations. This good agreement was also obtained for the buildup region. Although the silicon oxide layer of the MOSFET is not intrinsically very sensitive to neutron irradiation the presence of encapsulating materials leads to the generation of secondary photons and electrons which lead to shifts in threshold voltage and therefore confound gamma ray measurements in mixed neutron / gamma fields. To determine the energy dependant neutron response function of the MOSFET a detailed MCNP simulation was used. A lithiated shield was also incorporated into this model. The calculated neutron response functions were used to correct for neutron contributions to MOSFET measurements in mixed fields. MOSFET thermal neutron responses were measured using a series of measurements with MOSFETS both with and without lithiated covers exposed in the the Moata thermal neutron column at Ansto. The measurements were repeated with various gate potentials. The gamma doses measured were consistent with gamma doses measured using paired ionisation chambers. The Petten HB 11 facility is briefly described as are phantoms and MCNP models fabricated by S Wallace for an associated work. Measurements using PIN diodes and MOSFETs in phantoms exposed in the HB 11 beam are described. Foil activation data is compared to MCNP calculations to validate the MCNP models used. This thesis presents a number of results that have been recalculated in more detail and with various parameters changed. In particular the effect of variations in phantom hydration have been incorporated as have response functions for MOSFET detectors and associated shields. PIN diode measurements in a Perspex cube phantom exposed in the HB 11 beam show good agreement with MCNP calculated silicon displacement dose. Similarly good agreement is obtained for a cylindrical phantom filled with tissue equivalent gel when the hydrogen content of the gel in the original model is corrected for dehydration. Measurements in a more complex skull phantom show larger discrepancies between the experimental results and a MCNP simulation especially at depth. The discrepancies range from 25 � 300 % in absolute terms but are only 2 - 3 % of the maximum silicon dose. MOSFET measurements performed in the Perspex cube phantom using lithiated covers show excellent agreement with ionisation chamber measurements (also with lithiated covers). Measurements in a cylinder phantom and head phantom using lithium/perpex covered MOSFETs are compared with Monte Carlo calculations of induced gamma dose. In this case the measured gamma doses at approximately 2 cm depth appear to be too low. Further investigation involving a detailed MCNP simulation including the lithiated MOSFET covers in the model indicated that the covers suppress the thermal neutron flux at the measurement point and therefore the gamma dose is also reduced. Measurements at greater depths show a similar effect but to a lesser extent. The epithermal neutron beam at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) is described is described. PIN diode and MOSFET measurement results in a Perspex cube phantom are also presented. Reasonable agreement between calculated and measured PIN diode results is observed. MOSFET measurements show good agreement with the known percentage depth dose curve for the total gamma dose. However there is a discrepancy in the absolute magnitude of the measured gamma doses. It is proposed that this is also due to <b>thermal</b> neutron flux <b>depression</b> arising from the use of relatively thick lithiated neutron shields around the MOSFETS. In summary; It is demonstrated that PIN diodes could be useful for verifying treatment planning dose distributions in epithermal neutron beams. This includes the possibility of on line real-time measurements. They could also be used in conjunction with an activation foil to yield tissue equivalent dose measurements where the maximum neutron energy is less than 100 keV. Lithium shielded MOSFET measurements can be reconciled with calculated gamma dose distributions when the effect of flux depression is taken into account. However the perturbations introduced by the shield mean that the measured dose does not represent the dose at the measurement point in the absence of the shield. In order to use MOSFETs for gamma dosimetry in epithermal neutron beams different encapsulation is required to minimise neutron response and eliminate the need for lithiated covers. It is suggested that MCNP simulations of MOSFETs similar to the models in this thesis would provide an adequate tool for optimising the appropriate encapsulation...|$|R
