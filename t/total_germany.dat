50|$|The Ottoman {{public debt}} {{was part of}} a larger schemes of {{political}} control, through which the commercial interests of the world had sought to gain advantages that may not have been of the Empire's interest. The total pre-war debt of Empire was $716,000,000. France had 60 percent of the <b>total,</b> <b>Germany</b> was 20 percent, and the United Kingdom was 15 percent. The debt was administered by the Ottoman Public Debt Administration and its power was extended to the Imperial Ottoman Bank (or Central bank). The Ottoman Debt Administration controlled many of the important revenues of the Empire. The Council had power over financial affairs. Its control even extended to determine the tax on livestock in the districts.|$|E

The German ambassador proposed a joint protest with the empire's other creditor—states, on the grounds that international regulations could not be unilaterally abrogated, but no agreement could be reached on the text of the protest note.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} referendum, the German {{parliament}} published {{an analysis on}} {{the consequences of a}} Brexit on the EU and specifically on the economic and political situation of Germany. According to this, Britain is, after the United States and France, the third-most important export market for German products. In <b>total</b> <b>Germany</b> exports goods and services to Britain worth about €120 billion annually, which is about 8% of German exports, with Germany achieving a trade surplus with Britain worth €36.3 billion (2014). Should there be a [...] "hard Brexit", exports would be subject to WTO customs and tariffs. The trade weighted average tariff is 2.4%, but the tariff on automobiles, for instance, is 9.7%, so trade in automobiles would be particularly affected; this would also affect German automobile manufacturers with production plants in the United Kingdom. In total, 750,000 jobs in Germany depend upon export to Britain, while on the British side about three million jobs depend on export to the EU. The study emphasises however that the predictions on the economic effects of a Brexit are subject to significant uncertainty.|$|E

50|$|During the war, Germany stockpiled tabun, sarin, and soman but {{refrained from}} their {{use on the}} battlefield. In <b>total,</b> <b>Germany</b> {{produced}} about 78,000 tons of chemical weapons. By 1945 the nation produced about 12,000 tons of tabun and 1000 lb of sarin. Delivery systems for the nerve agents included 105 mm and 150 mm artillery shells, a 250 kg bomb and a 150 mm rocket. Even when the Soviets neared Berlin, Adolf Hitler was persuaded not to use tabun as the final trump card. The use of tabun was opposed by Hitler's Minister of Armaments, Albert Speer, who, in 1943, brought IG Farben's nerve agent expert Otto Ambros to report to Hitler. He informed Hitler that the Allies had stopped publication of research into organophosphates (a type of organic compound that encompasses nerve agents) {{at the beginning of}} the war, that the essential nature of nerve gases had been published as early as the turn of the century, and that he believed that Allies could not have failed to produce agents like tabun. This was not in fact the case, but Hitler accepted Ambros's deduction, and Germany's tabun arsenal remained unused.|$|E
