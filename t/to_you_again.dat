500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me from {{myself and}} give me <b>to</b> <b>You!),</b> <b>again</b> for soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht" [...] (I will not {{let go of my}} Jesus) is {{interwoven}} in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a [...] "love duet" [...] characterized by [...] "antiphonal avowals of commitment" [...] to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune.|$|E
2500|$|Fustian {{complains}} as {{well that}} authors are denied stagings because of these entertainments, and, as well, that playhouse managers would steal plays from their authors. [...] As Fustian says earlier, a playwright could spend four months {{trying to get a}} manager's attention and then [...] "he tells you it won't do, and returns it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again,</b> reserving the subject, and perhaps the name, which he brings out in his next pantomime" [...] (Pasquin IV i.).|$|E
2500|$|Prior to his {{departure}} from Taipei, Aquino gave an interview from his {{room at the}} Grand Hotel in which he indicated {{that he would be}} wearing a bulletproof vest. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: [...] "You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of 3 or 4 minutes it could be all over, and I {{may not be able to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> after this." [...] His last few moments in the flight while being interviewed by the journalist Jim Laurie, and just prior to disembarking from the flight at Manila airport, were recorded on camera.|$|E

2500|$|Marcos wanted Aquino to {{stay out}} of politics, however Aquino {{asserted}} his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, [...] "the Filipino is worth dying for." [...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I {{may not be able to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>again</b> after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E
