5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he insisted on <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> {{separation of church and}} state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> scrutiny approach but asserted that {{in reality it}} was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the many}} western {{travelers}} coming into China {{to live and}} trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks, recorded <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle.

Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
