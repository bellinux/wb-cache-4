In May {{they went back to}} Kitty Hawk with their 1905 Flyer to practice in private for their all-important public demonstration flights, as required by both contracts. <b>Their</b> <b>privacy</b> was lost when New York newspapers heard about the tests and sent several reporters to the scene.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on <b>their</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E

The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten <b>their</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the American Civil Liberties Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} <b>their</b> <b>privacy</b> concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As online social {{networks}} get more popular, it becomes increasingly critical to preserve user privacy in such networks. In this paper, we propose our preliminary results on defining and tackling information aggregation attacks over online {{social networks}}. We first introduce three major threats towards private information in online social networks. We conceptually model private information into multilevel and discretionary models. Then, we articulate information aggregation attacks under discretionary model. Finally, we present our preliminary design of “privacy monitor, ” {{a framework that}} allows users to define <b>their</b> own <b>privacy</b> scheme, and track <b>their</b> actual <b>privacy</b> disclosure to check for any unwanted leakage.

25|$|Based upon Nissan's {{actions in}} {{reviewing}} their E-mail messages as described above, plaintiffs sued Nissan for common law invasion of privacy, violation of their {{constitutional right to}} privacy, and violation of California's criminal wiretapping and eavesdropping statutes. They also brought a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy (termination {{in retaliation for the}} filing of complaints objecting to Nissan's invasion of <b>their</b> <b>privacy).</b>|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{he ruled}} that the other {{respondents}} beside Quon had not suffered a violation of <b>their</b> <b>privacy.</b> The respondents had, Kennedy wrote, simply argued that a violation of Quon's privacy necessarily violated that of those he exchanged messages with, and {{did not make a}} case that they could have suffered a violation even if Quon had not. Since the Court had found that Quon's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, it therefore had to hold that the others' were not, either.|$|E
25|$|Another ongoing major {{development}} is the change from a ward-based system (where patients are accommodated in communal rooms, separated by movable partitions) to one {{in which they are}} accommodated in individual rooms. The ward-based system has been described as very efficient, especially for the medical staff, but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to <b>their</b> <b>privacy.</b> A major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital; this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms.|$|E
