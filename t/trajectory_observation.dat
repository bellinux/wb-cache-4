40|$|Radar {{tracking}} of a projectile {{flying in the}} Earth's atmosphere {{is a very complex}} issue to cope with, due to the need of (suboptimal) nonlinear filtering techniques. Almost all cases found in literature assume that the target trajectory is observable from the firing point to the impact point on the ground, namely the <b>trajectory</b> <b>observation</b> gets under way from the first available measurement. The radar track initiation time is actually a stochastic quantity that has to be treated by means of a statistical procedure.

40|$|A lot {{of studies}} in road safety require knowing driver's speeds, {{particularly}} {{in order to}} determine legal speed limit or to calculate specific speed like the 85 percentile speed. Generally, speed distribution is obtained from a large number of measurements coming from inductive dual loops detector systems, collected during several weeks or months. In order to simplify the admittance of these data, a reconstruction of speed distribution method using a limited number of control-drivers is exposed. Based on road experiments, this study focuses on bends where speed is more constrained by the characteristics of the infrastructure (geometry, visibility, etc.). Moreover, data are recorded with a <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Observation</b> Station, a multi-sensors roadside system which is mainly made up of video cameras coupled with a scanning rangefinder...|$|E

In view of this difficulty, the improvement of the road safety involves a better knowledge of the driving behaviours in bends. Moreover, road managers need diagnostic tools for several applications : firstly, to identify dangerous areas in their network, particularly in bends, where drivers could react inappropriately; secondly, to analyse the impact of an infrastructure's modification (road markings, road signs, etc.) on the driver's behaviour. In order to reach both of these goals, a multi-sensors roadside system, named ODT (French acronym for <b>Trajectory</b> <b>Observation</b> Station), has been developed. This measurement system was installed for several weeks in different experimental sites in France. Thus, a great number of speed and lateral position data were collected. This paper presents results coming from the measurement campaigns and exposes the methodology used to characterize the trajectories of the vehicles. By this analysis, a level of risk could be defined which consolidates the safety diagnostic of the study area...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 96 - 100. In this thesis, {{we suggest}} {{an approach to}} statistical parameter estimation when an estimator is constructed by the <b>trajectory</b> <b>observations</b> of a stochastic system and apply the approach to reliability models. We analyze the asymptotic properties of the estimators constructed by the <b>trajectory</b> <b>observations</b> using moments method, maximum likelihood method and least squares method. Using limit theorems for Switching Processes and the results for parameter estimation by <b>trajectory</b> <b>observations,</b> we study the behavior of moments method estimators which are constructed by the <b>observations</b> of a <b>trajectory</b> of a switching process and prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of such estimators. We consider four different reliability models with large number of devices. For each of the models, we represent the system process as a Switching Process and prove that the system process converges to the solution of a differential equation. We also prove {{the consistency of the}} moments method estimators for each model. Simulation results are also provided to support asymptotic results and to indicate the applicability of the approach to finite sample case for reliability models. Güleryüz, GüldalPh. D...|$|R

We propose a distributed algorithm for camera network localization based on feature point correspondences between multiple cameras with sparse overlapping view structure. We prove convergence of the iterative piecewise-linearized algorithm using the projection onto convex sets (POCS) principle, since this algorithm corresponds to projecting onto subspaces that approximately overlap. We provide bounds on convergence rates and worst-case errors and show experimental results from actual images.

To quantify their effect knowledge of their properties needed. Parameterizations {{of the two most}} important bubble properties, rise velocity, VB, and bubble gas transfer velocity kBub are typically applied to varied environmental conditions despite being based largely on observation in distilled water at 20 0 C. Current understanding of bubble processes in the laboratory is either poor or lacking, for real world conditions, the situation is worse. Thus the input to a bubble model to predict aeration rates relies on many poor assumptions. A series of micro-physical laboratory experiments studying the single bubble hydrodynamics were conducted to measure VB and kBub with r for 300 < r < 3000 µm, where r is radius. Also studied was the bubble rise velocity for various natural waters. There are two distinct types or modes of oscillations observed for bubbles, rigid-body trajectory oscillations (zig-zag or helical), and shape or deformation oscillations.

We discover strong, visible, and quantifiable trends in the effect of music on perceived emotion of film. We perform studies using both selected classical and composed music segments annotated with diverse emotions, paired with ambiguous film clips. We collect and analyze viewers ’ ratings of stress, activity, and dominance in the silent film, and film with various music soundtracks. The results are mapped onto a threedimensional emotion space for visual and quantitative analysis. Aggregate scatter plots and center of mass results are presented using this emotion space. We find that the center of mass of the perceived emotion of film and music combined is consistently situated on a path between the center of mass of the music-alone response and that of the film-alone response. Regression analysis based on this <b>trajectory</b> <b>observation</b> results in coefficients with high R 2 values (R 2 = 0. 675 for stress, R 2 = 0. 817 for activity, and R 2 = 0. 813 for dominance) for the first study with classical music selections, and lower R 2 values (R 2 = 0. 199 for stress, R 2 = 0. 405 for activity, and R 2 = 0. 660 for dominance) for the second study with composed music. We conclude that continuous treatment of the two-dimensional emotion space provides a metric for comparing and assessing emotion ratings, and that spatial interpolation in this space provides a viable method for predicting the effect of music on perceived emotion of film...|$|E
40|$|This thesis utilises large {{deviation}} {{methods to}} study nonequilibrium phenomena in both quantum and classical systems. The dynamical analogues of the ensembles of statistical mechanics {{are used to}} explore dynamical phase spaces of systems, quantifying atypical fluctuations that can {{play a critical role}} in long term behaviour. A dynamical ensemble based on fixed numbers of dynamical events, allowing <b>trajectory</b> <b>observation</b> time to fluctuate, is introduced. This ensemble, denoted the x-ensemble, is found to be well suited to numerically simulate atypical fluctuations using transition path sampling (TPS). x-ensemble TPS schemes are analysed with reference to existing methods in both quantum and classical stochastic systems, and are found to offer more flexibility and efficiency in a variety of situations. The potential to develop this scheme into a self-optimizing algorithm is discussed with examples. The x-ensemble is then used in three non-equilibrium scenarios. Firstly in plaquette models of glass formers, in an effort to provide insight into the nature of the glass transition. It is shown that a two-dimensional triangular plaquette model (TPM) exhibits both a trajectory phase-transition between dynamical active and inactive phases, and when two replicas are coupled, a thermal phase transition between states of low and high overlap between the replicas. These two transitions are similar to those seen to occur in more realistic glass formers. When the TPM is generalised to a three-dimensional square pyramid plaquette model (SPyM) these dynamical and thermodynamic features of interest remain. It is argued that these models therefore provide an ideal test-bed for competing theories of the glass transition. Secondly the x-ensemble is used to define and analyse the dynamical analogue of the Jarzynski equality, allowing for the computation of dynamical free energy differences with, in principle, arbitrarily fast protocols linking two dynamical states. This relation is tested and found to hold in open quantum systems. Finally the partition sum zeros method of Lee and Yang is used to extract the location of dynamical phase transitions from the high-order, short-time cumulants of the x-ensemble. Results in both classical and open quantum systems are compared with previously studied dynamical ensembles, providing insight into the nature in which dynamical behaviours are encoded by these ensembles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for the automated external calibration (localization) {{of a network}} of cameras with non-overlapping fields of view, a type of network that is becoming widespread for monitoring large environments. The proposed algorithm exploits <b>trajectory</b> <b>observations</b> in each view and works iteratively on camera-pairs. First outliers are identified and removed from each camera observations. Next, spatio-temporal information derived from the available trajectory is used to estimate unobserved trajectory segments in areas uncovered by the cameras. The unobserved trajectory estimates are used to estimate the relative position of each camera-pair, whereas the exit-entrance direction of each object is used to estimate their relative orientation. The process continues and iteratively approximates the configuration of all cameras with respect to each other. Finally, we refine the initial configuration estimates with bundle adjustment, based on the observed and estimated trajectory segments. The accuracy and the robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated using both simulated and real datasets, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. I...|$|R

The hypothesis that very gradual decay has led to large numbers of deposits containing remains in a similar state appears illogical. It is more likely that, where poorly preserved biological remains are found, they either decayed in the past and then were stabilised when ground conditions became anoxic, or are currently in decay. Long-term patterns of decay cannot easily be investigated experimentally, but arguments concerning patterns and rates of decay can be. Apart from the question of in-ground preservation, understanding patterns of decay will allow us to address a range of taphonomic problems fundamental to drawing archaeological information from these remains...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} projective {{measurement of}} a quantum system {{often leads to}} a suppression of the dynamics, known as the Zeno effect. Alternatively, generalized nonprojective, so-called "weak" measurements can be carried out. Such a measurement is parameterized by its strength parameter that can interpolate continuously between the ideal strong measurement with no dynamics-the strict Zeno effect, and a weak measurement characterized by almost free dynamics but blurry observations. Here we analyze the stochastic properties of this uncertainty component in the resulting <b>observation</b> <b>trajectory.</b> The <b>observation</b> uncertainty results from intrinsic quantum uncertainty, the effect of measurement on the system (backaction) and detector noise. It is convenient to separate the latter, system-independent contribution from the system-dependent uncertainty, and this paper shows how to accomplish this separation. The system-dependent uncertainty is found {{in terms of a}} quasi-probability, which, despite its weaker properties, is shown to satisfy a weak positivity condition. We discuss the basic properties of this quasi-probability with special emphasis on its time correlation functions as well as their relationship to the full correlation functions along the <b>observation</b> <b>trajectory,</b> and illustrate our general results with simple examples. We demonstrate a violation of classical macrorealism using the fourth-order time correlation functions with respect to the quasi-probability in the twolevel system.

Statistical methods were applied on a three-month hourly data set (9 th January to 24 th March 2014) to study the influence of north-easterly winds on the patterns of particle mass and PNC size distributions. The 24 -h concentrations of particle mass obtained in this study were below the standard values detailed by the Recommended Malaysian Air Quality Guideline (RMAQG), United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and European Union (EU) except for PM 2. 5, which recorded a 24 -h average of 30 ± 18 μg m- 3 and exceeded the World Health Organisation (WHO) threshold value (25 μg m- 3).

Using the FAST single <b>trajectory</b> <b>observations</b> to validate the global convection patterns at key times and key locations, we have demonstrated that the AMIE procedure provides a reasonably good description of plasma circulations in the ionosphere during this interval. Our {{results show that the}} plasma convection in the ionosphere is consistent with the anti-parallel merging model. When the IMF has a strongly positive By component under northward conditions, we find that the global plasma convection forms two cells oriented nearly along the Sun-earth line in the ionosphere. In the northern hemisphere, the dayside cell has clockwise convection mainly circulating within the polar cap on open field lines. A second cell with counterclockwise convection is located in the nightside circulating across the polar cap boundary, The observed two-cell convection pattern appears to be driven by the reconnection along the anti-parallel merging lines poleward of the cusp extending toward the dusk side when IMF By/Bz much greater than 1. The magnetic tension force on the newly reconnected field lines drives the plasma to move from dusk to dawn in the polar cusp region near the polar cap boundary. The field-aligned currents in the cusp region flow downward into the ionosphere. The return field-aligned currents extend into the polar cap {{in the center of the}} dayside convection cell.

40|$|A new {{incremental}} four-dimensional variational (4 D-Var) data assimilation {{algorithm is}} introduced. The algorithm {{does not require}} the computationally expensive integrations with the nonlinear model in the outer loops. Nonlinearity is accounted for by modifying the linearization <b>trajectory</b> of the <b>observation</b> operator based on integrations with the tangent linear (TL) model. This allows us to update the linearization <b>trajectory</b> of the <b>observation</b> operator in the inner loops at negligible computational cost. As a result the distinction between inner and outer loops is no longer necessary. The key idea on which the proposed 4 D-Var method is based is that by using Gaussian quadrature it is possible to get an exact correspondence between the nonlinear time evolution of perturbations and the time evolution in the TL model. It is shown that J-point Gaussian quadrature can be used to derive the exact adjoint-based observation impact equations and furthermore that it is straightforward to account for the effect of multiple outer loops in these equations if the proposed 4 D-Var method is used.
