500|$|Despite viewing it {{imperfect}} and noting Songz had not {{mastered the}} balancing act [...] "between being a horny boy and ladies' man", Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said it was}} the best album of Songz's career, commenting, [...] "Trey <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step toward establishing himself as an A-list singer." [...] Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus, and complimented the eclecticity of the songs, saying no tracks are unlistenable. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums, commenting that the album is best is when it departs from the R. Kelly template. Lewis recommended that the album needed to be trimmed down and included with some from his mixtape Anticipation for what could have been, [...] "the black pop record of the year." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave to the album a dud (...) rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible". Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes called the album often [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] noting how Songz's work on freestyles and work ethic proves how the album could be better. Mangat did overall compliment the album, [...] "While Ready is far from a perfect album, it seems Trey is learning how to inspirit his original works with the charm and inventiveness found in his freestyles and covers." [...] The album earned Songz a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The Saturdays' debut album, Chasing Lights takes {{influence}} {{from a number}} of genres such as, synthpop, power pop, and new wave. The album also <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> electropop and dance-pop influence. Upon the release of the album, it was compared to Girls Aloud, Sugababes and Spice Girls. However, the band refused to accept that their music had comparisons. The band's debut single, [...] "If This Is Love," [...] features elements of synthpop and new wave genres. Many critics pointed out that they believe that the band's music would appeal more to the gay community. However, the band's music has taken criticism from some; Sir Elton John labelled the band's music [...] "crap" [...] and stated that he could hardly tell the difference between Girls Aloud's music and The Saturdays' music.|$|E

[...] Maddox was featured on the Season 8 episode, [...] "Old People," [...] discussing his views on the elderly in a very negative light. According to the article, during the filming for the show, his main argument was that the elderly should not be given [...] "benefits just for being old", citing individuals in the video such as Bernie Madoff and Robert Durst, and claimed to have made this argument during the interview numerous times. [...] However, he claimed that his arguments were edited in order to change his tone and arguments he made during the interview. Shortly {{after the release of}} the video and article, many fans of Maddox tweeted to Jillette, asking for an explanation. Jillette responded saying that [...] "...It was 1 minute on a very old show. I just don't remember" [...] and also admitting [...] "it was probably our fault." [...] Maddox's article was updated with an apology from Jillette via Twitter. He also commented on the apology saying [...] "It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> man to apologize. I think it's cool that Penn took the high ground and I consider this hatchet buried. Though we'll both likely get messages and emails for some time to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hassan {{explained}} that Lynsey does not {{cope with the}} challenge very well as she has already been pushed to breaking point over recent months and now she is trapped having to play Silas' psychotic game. Lynsey can not rest as she is thinking about the challenge, she is losing sleep and she has already lost her friends over her claims. It {{is a lot to}} have [...] "resting on her shoulders - she knows that somebody's life is in her hands. Lynsey tries to stand up to Silas, but he outwits her at every turn". At her [...] "lowest ebb", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels [...] "totally tired and exhausted". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E
