[...] I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like a Virgin' or 'Material Girl' (1984) is to me now. I didn't write either of those songs, and wasn't digging very deep then. I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, and I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E

What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E

[...] In comparing college and professional football in the 1940s, Daley noted: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> us enjoyed the college days better." [...] Daley's best season in professional football was 1947, when he played with Chicago. [...] He played in 14 games for the Rockets and had 633 yards of total offense: 447 yards rushing (including a 52-yard run) in 121 carries; 116 yards receiving on 12 catches; and 70 yards passing with three completions in six passes.|$|E

[...] In this way the mother told her {{daughter}} of her future duties; but behind the mother's back Kate made a grimace, for the benefit of her sister Fanny, showing thereby her conviction that in a matter of blood,--what she called being a gentleman,--a Thoroughbung could not approach an Annesley.|$|E

50|$|This scripture {{describes}} the first Buddhist council. It was held {{shortly after the}} Buddha's death, and collected the set of rules (Vinaya) and five sets of Dhamma. Tradition holds that little {{was added to the}} Canon after this. Scholars are more skeptical, but differ in their degrees of skepticism. Richard Gombrich <b>thinks</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the first four nikayas (see below) go back to the Buddha, in content but not in form. The late Professor Hirakawa Akira says that the First Council collected only short prose passages or verses expressing important doctrines, and that these were expanded into full length suttas over the next century.|$|R
