5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{infective agent}} may be embryonated eggs or infective larvae, and {{infection}} {{is due to}} ingestion of contaminated food, water, or intermediate hosts. As larvae are released into the intestinal area, they can burrow through intestinal walls, travel into the mesenteric veins, and migrate to the alveoli. Here, they undergo a pulmonary cycle, where the larvae develop into adult worms in a process <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> seven days. After reaching adulthood, M. laryngeus migrates upwards to the trachea, larynx, or bronchi, where sexual reproduction occurs. Egg production begins about three weeks later, and eggs are coughed up and expelled in sputum, or excreted in feces. Larvae may hatch from embryonated eggs outside of the mammalian host.|$|E

25|$|A {{culmination}} {{of use of}} official resources for private gain may lead to further pressures on incoming officials from other kinsmen. However, the fact is, the importation of modern rules on inter-ethnic political relationships is a recent colonial and western initiative <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> time to become the norm, deep allegiance to other ethnic groups for administrative decisions early on was sometimes viewed suspiciously, and an early institutionalization of a unitary system in the country, may also {{have led to a}} further familiar groupings induced corruption. Nevertheless, a modern practical approach to leadership and relationships has gradually taken a prominent role in the political process. The necessity for practical inter-depedence and cooperation is at the forefront of yearnings for good governance in the country.|$|E
25|$|According to Jewish law, a sefer Torah (plural: Sifrei Torah) is {{a copy of}} {{the formal}} Hebrew text {{handwritten}} on gevil or klaf (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a sefer Torah contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained sofer ("scribe"), an effort <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a gender}} {{division}} of labor {{in the process of}} collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour.|$|E

In addition, they're {{going to have to look}} at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they're carrying out structural reforms <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>take</b> two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary—everything from tax collection to labour markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term... n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root." ...|$|E

VanDerWerff was initially pleased that the show [...] "acknowledged that all of her actions are driven by a deep, sucking need to be loved" [...] and that [...] "Puck gently {{told her that she}} was better than that, that she could put herself together again", but not that it then [...] "just turned into more pointless Puck/Shelby/Quinn drama. Ugh." [...] Critics such as Kubicek were even more scathing about Shelby and the storyline with Puck that led to the pair having sex during the episode: [...] "The dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber." [...] Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E
