The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor enters Bennett's room, {{and finds}} <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as they seem. The {{supposedly}} crippled Bennett is missing, and {{a tape recorder}} hides his absence. He finds a trap door in {{the floor of the}} cabin and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.|$|E

25|$|Melvin Delos Mars was {{the first}} African-American woman to have an opera she {{composed}} produced: Leoni, the Gypsy Queen in Providence, Rhode Island in 1889. She went on to compose and star in four more full length operettas which were staged in either Boston, Massachusetts or Providence, Rhode Island between 1880–1896, including Fun At A Boarding School, and Love In Disguise; or, <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> What They Seem.

Cluny the Scourge—the evil one-eyed rat warlord, is hell-bent on destroying the tranquility {{as he prepares to}} fight a bloody battle for the ownership of Redwall. This dazzling story in the Redwall series is packed with all the wit, wisdom, humor, and blood-curdling adventure of the other books in the collection, but has the added bonus of taking the reader right back to {{the heart and soul of}} Redwall Abbey and the characters who live there.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} homomorphism is {{one that}} preserves all sups that exist, not just the finite sups, and likewise for infs. The category CABA of all CABAs and their complete homomorphisms is dual to the category of sets and their functions, meaning that it {{is equivalent to the}} opposite of that category (the category resulting from reversing all morphisms). <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> so simple for the category Bool of Boolean algebras and their homomorphisms, which Marshall Stone showed in effect (though he lacked both the language and the conceptual framework to make the duality explicit) to be dual to the category of totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces, subsequently called Stone spaces.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{quite that}} simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its {{energy from the}} Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E

Given headphones to listen to the actors over their microphones, Will overhears Anna bantering with her rude co-star, until the co-star mentions seeing Will and Anna refers to him dismissively. Saddened, Will leaves the set.|$|E
500|$|Creangă's {{contribution}} to literature also covers {{a series of}} didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them [...] "The Needle and the Sledge Hammer", in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin. The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as [...] "The Story of a Gold Coin", written earlier by Creangă's Junimist colleague Vasile Alecsandri. A similar piece, [...] "The Flax and the Shirt", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "all <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else." [...] The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: Pâcală, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; [...] "The Bear Tricked by the Fox", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and Cinci pâini ("Five Loafs of Bread"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs {{from a variety of}} Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, [...] "El Modelo Alfabético" [...] ("The Model Alphabetical"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the Dúo Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl Troller, about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. [...] "El Renacuajo Paseador" [...] ("The Tadpole Walker"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iván Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Dúo Huellas, Fundación Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named [...] "Rin Rin", that left his home without the approval of his mother [...] "Rana" [...] ("Frog"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on [...] "El Gato Bandido" [...] ("The Bandit Cat"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> easy by yourself, and returns feeling repentant. Aterciopelados performs on [...] "Mirringa Mirronga", which is about a feline mega-party.|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."
