5|$|All three boats had successes during World War I; {{between them}} they sank five ships with a {{combined}} tonnage of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged , a French dreadnought of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>was</b> raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only survivor of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>was</b> ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
50|$|When {{imported}} <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> designated YH (YouHao meaning 'friendship'), {{but after}} the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations during the Cultural revolution (see Sino-Soviet split) <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> renamed FX (FanXiu meaning 'anti-revisionist'). In 1971 <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> returned to <b>the</b> original designation 'FD' of soviet Russian origin (after Felix Dzerzhinsky).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> MD <b>Class</b> of 2020 had {{an average}} MCAT score of 30 and GPA of 3.62 at admission. 12% of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> from groups {{historically}} underrepresented in medicine, and 71% of the 108 students that comprise <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>are</b> from Pennsylvania. 29% of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> specifically from Northeastern Pennsylvania and North Central Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Class</b> <b>are</b> a two car tilting DMU built between 1998 and 2003 by Adtranz in Hennigsdorf {{which later}} became Bombardier Transportation. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>are</b> {{also known as}} RegioSwingers.|$|R
5|$|During construction, which {{occurred}} during World War II, {{there were several}} modifications, delays and accidents during construction to avoid the trains being finished before the war ended; this was to avoid the finished trains {{to be able to}} assist the German occupation forces. The first three units were finished in 1945, and delivery was completed the following year. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> originally numbered 106, but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956, and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> renumbered to 66. The units consisted of three cars, given the lettering BFM, B and BS. They were numbered 66.01–04, 66.31–34 and 66.61–64, respectively; this numbering system dates from 1970.|$|E
5|$|HMS Cyclops, {{the lead}} ship of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>was</b> the third ship to be completed. She {{was placed in}} 1st Reserve after her completion. The ship was paid off at Chatham in August 1878 and {{refitted}} in 1887–89.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the Central section. The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E
50|$|Six {{locomotives}} of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> built; introduced between 1934 and 1936. Between 1943 and 1944 <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt under Gresley's successor Edward Thompson into <b>the</b> LNER Thompson <b>Class</b> A2/2 4-6-2 type.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{widely used}} in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand, mainly for heavy yard shunting, {{although}} some members of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> have <b>been</b> used for local mainline shunting services. All members of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>are</b> now fitted with shunters refuges, and most are fitted with remote control capabilities.|$|R
50|$|While the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> 64s <b>are</b> preserved in Germany, seven of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>are</b> preserved in other countries.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{gradually}} {{replaced in}} the southeast England during the late 1950s and early 1960s due {{to the introduction of}} further electrification, new lightweight standard steam classes, diesel shunters, and diesel-electric multiple units. By the end of 1963 the majority that remained were based at Bournemouth to work the Swanage branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{classic example}} of a Type IIb {{supernova}} is Supernova 1993J, while another example is Cassiopeia A. The IIb class was first introduced (as a theoretical concept) by Woosley et al. in 1987, and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> soon applied to SN 1987K and SN 1993J.|$|E
5|$|The six Collins-class {{submarines}} are {{the most}} expensive items in the Australian Defence Force inventory. The annual cost of operating and maintaining <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> estimated at A$100 million in 2000, and at A$322 million in 2008.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Belorussiya <b>class</b> cruiseferries (sometimes also {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> Gruziya <b>class)</b> <b>were</b> built by Wärtsilä Turku Shipyard, Finland in 1975–1976 for the Black Sea Shipping Company, Soviet Union. The five ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> originally used in ferry service around the Black Sea. During the 1980s all ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt into cruise ships. During the end of the 1990s all ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> sold to other operators. As of 2008, at least four ships in this <b>class</b> <b>were</b> in service. <b>The</b> effects of the new SOLAS regulations that came into effect in 2010 remain unknown.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> {{numbered}} 657-666, {{and just}} as <b>the</b> T3 <b>class</b> <b>were</b> a smaller-wheeled version of <b>the</b> X2 <b>class,</b> <b>the</b> X6 <b>class</b> <b>were</b> a smaller-wheeled version of <b>the</b> T6 <b>class.</b> <b>The</b> boiler <b>was</b> identical to that used <b>the</b> T6 <b>class.</b> Some of <b>the</b> engines were subsequently fitted with a Drummond boiler, including No. 658 which was the last Adams 4-4-0 to remain in service.|$|R

All three Erics have negative, stereotyped, nicknames {{that reflect the}} opposite of their personalities. Eric Bacon, the skinniest child in <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>is</b> nicknamed [...] "Fatso", Eric Fry, the best athlete in <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>is</b> nicknamed [...] "Butterfingers", and Eric Ovens, the nicest student in <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>is</b> nicknamed [...] "Crabapple".|$|R
5|$|USS Tucker (DD-57), {{the lead}} ship of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down by}} the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, in November 1914 and {{launched}} in May 1915. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Samuel Tucker.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{experimentally}} boilered No. 126, all the M7s entered into British Railways service in 1948. In that year No. 672 fell down the lift shaft which provided rolling stock {{access to the}} Waterloo and City Line at Waterloo, and was cut up. The remainder survived until 1957, {{but over the next}} seven years the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn as part of the Modernisation Plan..|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Croatian War of Independence DBM-241 was {{relocated}} to Montenegro where it later entered service with the SR Yugoslav Navy. DBM-242, now redesignated as DBM-81 was launched as Cetina and entered service with the Croatian Navy 19 February 1992 with Ivo Raffanelli in command. For the remainder of the war, Cetina was engaged in transporting troops and equipment along the coast, including supply runs for Croatian forces during Operation Maslenica in 1993. The same year the ship participated in testing of the new MNS-M90 naval mine. DBM-82, the third and final ship of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>was</b> commissioned with the Croatian Navy on 9 March 1995 with Jerko Bošnjak in command.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{supplying}} {{students with}} individual class rankings, GW Law recognizes academic performance with two scholar designations. The top 1-15% of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> designated George Washington Scholars while the top 16-35% of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> designated Thurgood Marshall Scholars.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a numeral {{is added}} for {{vacuum-tube}} stages. If grid current is {{not permitted to}} flow, <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> AB1. If grid current is allowed to flow (adding more distortion, but giving slightly higher output power) <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> AB2.|$|R
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, {{it does not}} possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to use its small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) bottom mines or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.|$|E
5|$|El 18 is a {{modification}} of the Swiss Re 460. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> originally built in 119 units from 1992 to 1995 for the Swiss State Railways, where it was given the brand Lok 2000. It {{was part of a}} project to create a series of new intercity locomotives and cars. Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon-Bahn received eight units in 1994 (as Re 465), the Finnish State Railways received 46 units between the years 1995-2003 (as Sr2) and the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation received 2 units in 1997. The units are designed to haul heavy passenger trains along existing curved railways at high speeds. It is designed as a universal locomotive, so it is also suitable for freight trains.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, {{main line}} {{dieselisation}} began and progressively displaced <b>the</b> K <b>class,</b> especially as <b>the</b> DA <b>class</b> <b>was</b> introduced from 1955. Some of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt with new frames in 1955-57 {{but most of}} <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> in storage by 1961 and {{the decision was made}} that year <b>the</b> <b>class</b> would receive no more A grade overhauls, other than K 911. Withdrawal began in 1964, and all members exited service by 1967. Three of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> retained by Hutt Workshops for use as stationary boilers, replacing three Garratt boilers from <b>the</b> G <b>class.</b> These 3 heavily stripped members lasted in such use service until 1988 when they were auctioned off.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to current}} {{competition}} standards there <b>are</b> two <b>classes</b> of trials bike recognized.

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1990: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and sidecar. The 50/80cc referred {{to the size of}} the engines of the motorcycles that raced in that class. The Grand Prix Road Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 50cc was introduced in 1962, 13 years after the start of the first world championships.
