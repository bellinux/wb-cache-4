5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> in this group is unlike <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E

40|$|Trends of {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) in transition countries are peculiar: they show substantial {{changes that are}} more strongly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> of GDP than in other developed countries. This paper examines the role of <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> of GDP and of social trust in predicting <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> of well-being. We find that {{the strength of the}} relationship between social trust and SWB over the medium-term is comparable to that of GDP. We conclude that in the medium-term, even in countries where material concerns strongly affect well-being, social trust is a powerful predictor of <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> of SWB. However, in the short run the relationship between social trust and SWB does not hold and GDP stands out as the only significant correlate of SWB...|$|R

Nevertheless, Extension does continually examine its program focus and make marginal adjustments in its portfolio. The purpose of this descriptive paper is to examine <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> over time in Extension personnel (FTEs). <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> will be described in two ways. First, the paper will describe <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> in Extension FTEs for the U. S. and for the major regions for the 1977 - 97 time period. Secondly, the paper will contrast <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> in FTEs for the four major program areas of Extension, again at the U. S. and regional levels, for the 1977 - 92 time period. The temporal and regional variations in resource allocations for Extension {{will be discussed in}} the context of other relevant variables and the institutional setting...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> study {{examines}} <b>trends</b> in characteristics of convective and stratiform precipitation in the Czech Republic over 1982 – 2010. <b>The</b> spatially averaged <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation are rising for indices of mean precipitation, and the increases are significant in all seasons except for winter. For extremes, <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> are spatially much more variable and insignificant, but increases tend to prevail as well. <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation are larger {{in the western}} part of the country where Atlantic influences are stronger. For characteristics of stratiform precipitation, <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> are usually smaller compared to those of convective precipitation, but increases prevail too. They are significant in autumn, especially for extremes, and larger in the eastern part of the country where Mediterranean cyclones play more important role. <b>The</b> <b>trends</b> in convective precipitation tend to be more pronounced at lowland than higher-elevated stations while an opposite pattern prevails for stratiform precipitation. The results suggest that in spring and summer, when convective precipitation represents an important fraction of the total amounts in central Europe (around 30 % and 50 %, respectively), the observed increases in total precipitation are mainly due to increases in convective precipitation. In autumn, increases in both convective and stratiform precipitation are important, and <b>the</b> <b>trends</b> are weakest and least pronounced in winter...|$|R

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.)

5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is {{in accordance with the}} trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues <b>the</b> <b>trend</b> in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
