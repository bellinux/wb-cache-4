50|$|Hoes {{fashioned}} from bison scapula were common cultivating tools among the Plains Village Indians. In particular, {{it was used}} for cultivating small garden crops. It continued to be used among these Indians until iron hoes were brought by French traders in the 18th century. Recovered bone hoes range from 40 cm to as small as 15 cm. The size variation is due, in large part, <b>to</b> frequent <b>resharpening.</b>|$|R
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper <b>to</b> build and <b>resharpen</b> and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|R
40|$|In a joint {{research}} effort hard layers of TiC and TiN were successfully applied to titanium components/tools. The technique of alloying by laser surface melting in an artificial gaseous atmosphere was optimized {{to such an}} extent that it was possible to test some of the coated tools in simulated operating conditions and even to use them in production in some cases. Theadvantage offered by this type of coating is the gradual reduction in hardness and thus also itsboutstanding adhesive at a high layer thickness. This layer thickness enables cutting tools, for example, <b>to</b> be <b>resharpened</b> several times. (orig.) SIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: D. Dt. F.

50|$|Known as the tranchet {{technique}} {{that makes the}} tranchet flake, this term can be defined in two ways: first, it is the forming of a straight edge used to cut {{from the edge of}} the tranchet flake by taking off a large flat flake from the tip. Second, it can be defined as the method one uses <b>to</b> <b>resharpen</b> or form the cutting edge of either an ax or an adze.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} steel blade that benefits from regular honing and resharpening {{in order to}} keep a sharp edge, a ceramic knife will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer—up to 10x longer according to some tests. The inherent hardness of the ceramic material also makes it more difficult for the consumer <b>to</b> <b>resharpen.</b> [...] Although a ceramic knife therefore does not need regular sharpening {{in the same way as}} steel, its blade edge will eventually degrade or chip and lose its cutting edge, at which point specialized sharpening services are required for the ceramic edge.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon {{steel is}} an alloy {{of iron and}} carbon, often {{including}} other elements such as vanadium and manganese. Carbon steel commonly used in knives has around 1.0% carbon (ex. AISI 1095), is inexpensive, and holds its edge well. Carbon steel is normally easier <b>to</b> <b>resharpen</b> than most stainless steels, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. The blades should be cleaned, dried, and lubricated after each use and new carbon-steel knives may impart a metallic or [...] "iron" [...] flavour to acidic foods, though over time, the steel will acquire a patina of oxidation which will prevent corrosion. Good carbon steel will take a sharp edge, but is not so hard as {{to be difficult to}} sharpen, unlike some grades of stainless steel.|$|E
40|$|Advances in Slow and Fast Light IV, San Francisco, California, January 22, 2011 We study {{analytically}} {{pulse distortion}} in linear slow light systems, and provide some useful limits on these devices. Additionally, we {{also show that}} the contributions of phase and amplitude broadening can be de-coupled and quantified. It is observed that phase broadening is generally smaller than amplitude broadening in conventional slow light media (lorentzian gain profile) except for very large fractional delays, where it becomes larger. Upon these expressions, we may envisage new strategies to minimize the distortion in the delaying of pulses, depending on the specific application and the required fractional delay. To overcome the residual distortion, we show that nonlinear systems can lead <b>to</b> a <b>resharpening</b> of the pulses and a re-generation of the filtered frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Douze and Delagnes (2016) revisit Middle Stone Age (MSA) lithic assemblages {{from the}} Gademotta Formation (Fm.), Ethiopia. Their {{analysis}} of selected assemblages from {{three of the}} 1972 excavations expands the original typo-technological interpretations by Wendorf and Schild (1974). We particularly welcome their evaluation of our recent inferences about the function of pointed artifacts and technological patterns in the Gademotta Fm. (Sahle et al., 2013, 2014). However, we find several arguments and conclusions in Douze and Delagnes (2016) to be rather unconvincing and irreconcilable with results from analyses of whole assemblages (Wendorf and Schild, 1974; Sahle et al., 2013, 2014). Specifically, their summary attribution of all early MSA burin-like fractures on the distal tips of pointed artifacts <b>to</b> intentional <b>resharpening</b> blows, and their use of this pattern as a technological “chrono-marker” unique to the region are untenable. Here, we highlight these issues {{in the hopes of}} a clearer understanding of the evident technological patterns in the Gademotta Fm...|$|R
50|$|The {{edge of the}} scraper that is {{extremely}} angled is the working edge. This edge {{is often used to}} soften hides or cleaning the meat off of the hides, in addition to being used for wood work. As the term scraper suggests, this tool was scraped at the hide or wood in order to reach the end goal. Scrapers tended to be large enough to fit comfortably in the hand and could be used without being mounted on wood or bone. However, it is very likely that scrapers were mounted on short handles even though it is very rare to find mounted scrapers. As scrapers are used they have <b>to</b> be <b>resharpened</b> in order <b>to</b> stay effective. This causes them to get progressively smaller as they are used, resharpened, used, resharpend, and used again. Consequently, the majority of the scrapers that are found on sites are ones that have been <b>resharpened</b> and used <b>to</b> the point of being no longer functional.|$|R
50|$|Various alloys {{of steel}} {{can be made}} which offer {{a wide range of}} {{physical}} and chemical properties desirable for blades. For example, surgical scalpels are often made of stainless steel so that they remain free of rust and largely chemically inert; tool steels are hard and impact resistant (and often expensive as retaining toughness and hardness requires expensive alloying materials, and, being hard, they are difficult to make into their finished shape) and some are designed to resist changes to their physical properties at high temperatures. Steels can be further heat treated to emphasize their toughness (important for impact blades), or hardness, which is a major factor in how well they will retain an edge in use and in how easy they will be <b>to</b> <b>resharpen</b> (harder metals require more effort to sharpen).|$|E
30|$|The {{pretreatment}} that {{is essential}} for depositing diamond films on the WC-Co substrate [11], {{as well as the}} coverage of the film will both change the geometry of the cutter that is optimal-designed for finish-milling Al alloys, especially the radius of the cutting edge. Due {{to the fact that the}} small radius of the cutting edge often means the small cutting force and the improved machining quality [12, 13], and the passivation of the edge probably deteriorate the machining quality. Therefore, how to alleviate the passivation, or how <b>to</b> <b>resharpen</b> the cutting edge becomes imperative.|$|E
40|$|Isotachophoresis of {{proteins}} in a networked microfluidic chip: Experiment and 2 -D simulation This paper reports both the experimental application and 2 -D simulation of ITP {{of proteins}} in a networked microfluidic chip. Experiments demonstrate that {{a mixture of}} three fluo-rescent proteins can be concentrated and stacked into adjacent zones of pure protein under a constant voltage of 100 V over a 2 cm long microchannel. Measurements of the iso-tachophoretic velocity of the moving zones demonstrates that, during ITP under a constant voltage, the zone velocity decreases as more of the channel is occupied by the terminating electrolyte. A 2 -D ITP model based on the Nernst–Planck equations illustrates the stacking and separation features of ITP using simulations of three virtual proteins. The self-shar-pening behavior of ITP zones dispersed by a T-junction is clearly demonstrated both by experiment and by simulation. Comparison of 2 -D simulations of ITP and zone electro-phoresis (ZE) confirms that ZE lacks the ability <b>to</b> <b>resharpen</b> protein zones after they pass through a T-junction. Keywords...|$|E
5000|$|Sharpening {{straight}} edges (knives, chisels, etc.) by hand {{can be divided}} into phases. First the edge is sharpened with an abrasive sharpening stone, or a succession of increasingly fine stones, which shape the blade by removing material; the finer the abrasive the finer the finish. Then the edge may be stropped by polishing the edge with a fine abrasive such as rouge or tripoli on a piece of stout leather or canvas. The edge may be steeled or honed by passing the blade against a hard metal or ceramic [...] "steel" [...] which plastically deforms and straightens the material of the blade's edge which may have been rolled over irregularly in use, but not enough <b>to</b> need complete <b>resharpening.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Mode 2 tool is a biface {{consisting}} of two concave surfaces intersecting to form a cutting edge all the way around, except {{in the case of}} tools intended to feature a point. More work and planning go into the manufacture of a Mode 2 tool. The manufacturer hits a slab off a larger rock to use as a blank. Then large flakes are struck off the blank and worked into bifaces by hard-hammer percussion on an anvil stone. Finally the edge is retouched: small flakes are hit off with a bone or wood soft hammer <b>to</b> sharpen or <b>resharpen</b> it. The core can be either the blank or another flake. Blanks are ported for manufacturing supply in places where nature has provided no suitable stone.|$|R
40|$|Fan (or tabular) {{scrapers}} are a diagnostic  tool type in Chalcolithic Ghassulian and Early Bronze Age lithic assemblages from  {{the southern}} Levant. To date, only {{small numbers of}} fan scrapers have been reported from the Late Pottery Neolithic Wadi Rabah culture. In this paper we present a techno-typological analysis of a fair sample of fan scrapers and fan scrapers spalls from Wadi Rabah and Early Bronze Age layers at Ein Zippori, Lower Galilee, Israel. Techno-typological similarities and differences of Wadi Rabah, Chalcolithic Ghassulian and Early Bronze Age fan scrapers from Ein Zippori and other sites {{in the region are}} presented, trends of change along time are noted, and an updated definition is proposed. Our results indicate that fan scrapers are highly efficient tools for accurate and prolonged animal butchering and hide working. The main advantage of fan scrapers is their mostly flat, thin morphology and large size that permits the creation of several relatively long working edges, various retouched angles (from sharp <b>to</b> abrupt), extensive <b>resharpening,</b> and a comfortable grasp. While fan scrapers were products of a local trajectory in Late Pottery Neolithic Wadi Rabah lithic industries at Ein Zippori, a standardized, off-site manufacturing of fan scrapers is evident during the Early Bronze Age...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} past human behavior, {{it is necessary to}} identify and explain variability in the cultural materials resulting from this behavior. Chipped stone artifacts are the most ubiquitous cultural materials from the Middle Paleolithic. However, the interpretation of variability in these artifacts has been difficult. To address this problem, morphological variability in 1, 146 Middle Paleolithic chipped stone tools, from four sites in the Iberian Peninsula, is examined in detail. This study differs from other analyses of Middle Paleolithic artifacts in emphasizing a quantitative investigation of both continuous and discrete morphological variability at the level of tool edges. These data permit analyses of the distribution of variability at the levels of individual edges, whole pieces, and assemblages. Patterns of lithic variability are also examined in the context of early Upper Pleistocene chronology and environment and compared with a larger population of Middle Paleolithic sites in Spain and the northwestern Mediterranean as a whole. For the assemblages studied, variability in edge morphology is predominantly continuous and normally distributed. Signficantly patterned relationships between edge attributes are restricted to cases in which one attribute limits, rather than determines, the range of variability in the other. These seem primarily based in the degree <b>to</b> which use, <b>resharpening,</b> and consequent edge reduction has taken place. Additionally, a dichotomy in patterns of edge use is suggested, associated with the extensiveness of use and modification. For whole pieces, most variability mirrors that of edges, suggesting that retouched artifacts are more the result of the extent and nature of the use of their edges than planned tools for which the maker had some form of "mental template. " At the level of assemblages, temporal variability is minimal, while spatial and environmental associated variability is more apparent. These results are examined in light of the three most often proposed explanations for variability in Middle Paleolithic assemblages [...] style, function, and diachronic change. Subsequently, other aspects of Middle Paleolithic behavior [...] ranging from raw material usage to settlement patterns [...] are examined as potential sources for the patterns of lithic variability in the assemblages studied...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a preliminary {{statement of the}} scientific (archaeological) significance of Aboriginal stone artefact scatters and associated heat-retainer hearths at three locations in Paroo-Darling National Park in western NSW, by undertaking reconnaissance geoarchaeological surveys and analyses of artefact assemblages at these locations. It extends previous studies undertaken by WNSWAP (Western New South Wales Archaeological Programme) in the western region of NSW by studying the relationship between geomorphological history and surface archaeological exposure in environments that are unique to Paroo-Darling National Park. Geoarchaeological survey techniques developed elsewhere in western NSW were applied {{at each of the}} three locations to provide the information needed to assess the nature, extent and scientific significance of stone artefact scatters and the likely impacts of visitor activity. The three locations preserve dense concentrations of artefacts that, when treated as three separate assemblages, reveal a varied behavioural record. The Peery (Pine) Creek (CW) location contains a high proportion of lightly worked silcrete cores, many retaining cortex, suggesting that the people who occupied this place were not concerned to conserve the raw material they introduced. The assemblage features an unusually high proportion of adzes, many as expended slugs that have been <b>resharpened</b> <b>to</b> exhaustion. Evidently, the people who occupied this place had the time to repair the tools for which these adzes formed the cutting edge. By contrast, at the Peery Lake foreshore (NP), adzes are not frequent but pirri points and backed blades are unusually common. The assemblage from Round Hill is also distinct, being dominated by flakes and cores as would be expected if this location were used primarily as a source for abundant good quality raw material. Radiocarbon age determinations on charcoal extracted from the remains of heat-retainer hearths at CW and NP provide evidence for Aboriginal occupation in the last 2000 years. Like other locations in western NSW, the nine age determinations from CW are clustered into three groups, separated by gaps, rather than evenly or randomly distributed through time. However, the pattern of clusters and gaps at CW appears different to those from other locations we have studied, and will require further verification. There were no hearth remains at the Round Hill location, so no absolute determination of the timing of use by Aboriginal people is possible. However, it may support a much longer record, perhaps tens of thousands of years, as it is a residual surface not subject to the kinds of geomorphic processes that obliterate or obscure the record at valley floor locations. The archaeological material preserved at the three locations in Paroo-Darling National Park contains a regionally specific record of past human behaviour when compared to other similarly studied locations in western NSW, and therefore is of archaeological significance. Efforts should be made to ensure the protection of the archaeological record from damage caused by an increase in visitors from the present levels. If visitor facilities are to be created at these areas, consideration should be given to positioning them so that the artefacts are not further disturbed or damaged, and that they are located to keep visitors at some distance from the artefacts and hearths. Alternative locations for the proposed visitor facilities are suggested for each location. 82 page(s...|$|R
