5|$|Experimental {{transmissions}} of the DAB Eureka 147 standard {{from the}} Crystal Palace <b>transmitting</b> <b>station</b> by the BBC started in 1990 with permanent transmissions covering London in September 1995. With {{the expansion of}} its single-frequency network {{in the spring of}} 1998, the BBC national ensemble was available to 65% of the UK population by 2001, 85% by 2004 and 96.4% by 2015. DAB+ full-time broadcasts began in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The British Broadcasting Corporation started {{broadcasting}} the BBC World Service on shortwave and mediumwave {{radio for}} a few hours a day across Europe from Orford Ness in Suffolk and Kvitsøy in Norway, the latter being receivable across England, Wales and Southern Scotland. Today, the BBC broadcasts the BBC World Service using DRM for one hour a day from the Woofferton <b>transmitting</b> <b>station</b> in Shropshire.|$|E
5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and {{direct access to the}} primary conning position. The rear <b>Transmitting</b> <b>Station</b> was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E

5|$|Brownhills has no {{dedicated}} {{local newspaper}} of its own, but {{is covered by}} newspapers published in Wolverhampton and Walsall. The most popular paid-for local newspaper is the Express & Star. Free newspapers with significant circulation in the town include the Walsall Chronicle, Walsall Advertiser, and Walsall Observer. Similarly, the town has no dedicated local radio station but receives the stations broadcast from the Sutton Coldfield <b>transmitting</b> <b>station,</b> including BRMB and Kerrang! 105.2.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each <b>transmitting</b> <b>station</b> would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches thick {{and it had a}} 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the <b>Transmitting</b> <b>Station</b> on the middle deck. The walls of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} practical {{method for}} the electromagnetic (EM) fields reduction around <b>transmitting</b> <b>stations</b> has been developed. The {{project has been}} stimulated by the necessity to reduce the field levels {{in the vicinity of}} <b>transmitting</b> <b>stations,</b> including FM, UHF, cellular base stations and other radiocommunication services, to obey regulations concerning human protection against electromagnetic radiation. The main constraint in the optimization procedure is the requirement to preserve the radiated power ERP of a service in operation. The method joins accuracy with high efficiency, and is based on 3 stages procedure using the antenna numerical models of different levels of approximation. An example is given of its application to a real case of <b>transmitting</b> <b>stations</b> in which the levels of measured EM exceeded the safety limits...|$|R

He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN <b>Transmitting</b> <b>Station</b> in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the Haitian Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for the Haitian military leadership and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E
