Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares.

The portion of NY386 on Chili Center–Coldwater Road is co-designated as CR256. Along Westside Drive, NY386 is part of CR119, the designation for all of Westside Drive. The Coldwater Road segment, meanwhile, is also CR198 while CR158 was extended north <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of Elmgrove Road.|$|E

5|$|Goldstone {{insisted that}} he would not follow a one-sided mandate but would {{investigate}} any abuses committed by either side during the conflict. He said that he had initially not been willing to take on the mission unless the mandate was expanded <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with}} other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes.

5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a job in the government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate {{for a period of time}} before selling it. This proposal was however rejected, and aggregation occurred on 31 December 1991, with NBN acquiring Nine Network affiliation. Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E
5|$|One Australian {{study found}} that the primary topics covered by U.S. {{fellowship}} programs were emergency medicine systems development, humanitarian relief, disaster management, public health, travel and field medicine, program administration, and academic skills.

5|$|The Philippines {{was named}} in honor of King PhilipII of Spain. Spanish {{explorer}} Ruy López de Villalobos, during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then-Prince of Asturias. Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as Islas del Poniente (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.|$|E
5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

A legal {{dispute between the}} two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund {{and that it had}} to reduce its prices. The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term. CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004 and in 2008. In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of its customer support and billing for residential services.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to the editor in Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, it was suggested that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used bolts to climb the Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, it was the first time bolts were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>all</b> federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the court has affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E
