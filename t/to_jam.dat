5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction <b>to</b> <b>Jam</b> and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Joey Santiago and {{songwriter}} Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) met when they lived {{next to each}} other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> together. Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized {{she would not be}} able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|No. 5 Group RAF and No. 1 Group RAF {{committed}} 15 and 16 Avro Lancaster bombers to drop naval {{mines in}} Oslo harbour. Around 36 Mark IV and 54 Mark VI mines.

5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E
5|$|To disrupt British radio transmissions, Wolfgang Martini's unit, the Funkhorchdienst (Radio Enlightening Service, or Signals intelligence) {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> radio-telephone frequencies.

In addition Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 2 (Bomber Wing 2) was ordered to fly electronic deception missions over the western channel to divert enemy aircraft. Joachim Coeler's Fliegerkorps IX prepared to strike at RAF bases in south-west England and to engage and slow down British naval forces that might attempt an interception. Fernaufklärungsgruppe 123 (strategic or long-range reconnaissance) was responsible for maintaining reconnaissance in the channel's east and west entrance and was to support Fliegerkorps IX.|$|E
5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E

30|$|Resilience <b>to</b> {{electromagnetic}} <b>jamming</b> and its avoidance {{are difficult}} problems. It is often both hard <b>to</b> distinguish malicious <b>jamming</b> from congestion {{in the broadcast}} regime and a challenge to conceal the activity patterns of the legitimate communication protocol from the jammer. Jamming may be both malicious with the intention to block communication of an adversary or nonmalicious {{in the form of}} unintended channel interference. In the context of embedded wireless networks for time-critical and safety critical operation as in medical devices and industrial control networks, it is essential that mechanisms for resilience <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> are native <b>to</b> the communication protocol. Resilience <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> and its avoidance, collectively termed as anti-jamming, are a hard practical problem as the jammer has an unfair advantage in detecting legitimate communication activity due to the broadcast nature of the channel. The jammer can then emit a sequence of electromagnetic pulses to raise the noise floor and disrupt communication. Communication nodes are unable <b>to</b> differentiate <b>jamming</b> signals from legitimate transmissions or changes in communication activity due to node movement or nodes powering off without some minimum processing at the expense of local and network resources.|$|R

25|$|Early on, it was {{believed}} that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver.

In October a group had been sent <b>to</b> <b>jam</b> the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.|$|E
40|$|Amorphous {{materials}} {{as diverse as}} foams, emulsions, colloidal suspensions and granular media can jam into a rigid, disordered state where they withstand finite shear stresses before yielding. Here we review the current understanding of the transition <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> {{and the nature of}} the jammed state for disordered packings of particles that act through repulsive contact interactions and are at zero temperature and zero shear stress. We first discuss the breakdown of affine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then extensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres. At the jamming point, these systems are marginally stable (isostatic) in the sense of constraint counting, and many geometric and mechanical properties scale with distance <b>to</b> this <b>jamming</b> point. Finally we discuss current explorations of jamming of frictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and asphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit, but in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle distance <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> and distance <b>to</b> isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities are governed by the contact number and scale with distance to isostaticity, while the contact number itself scales with distance <b>to</b> <b>jamming.</b> Comment: Submitted <b>to</b> J Phys Cond Matt 25 pages, 23 figures [...] in low resolution.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{broadcast}} nature of the wireless medium, wireless networks are highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> attacks. Such attacks are often studied in a game theoretic framework under the assumption of uninterrupted traffic subject <b>to</b> continuous <b>jamming</b> opportunities. Instead, we analyze the effect of dynamically changing traffic on jamming games for power controlled medium access. Random packet arrivals raise {{the possibility that the}} transmitter queues may be empty when jamming attacks start and thus waste the energy of jammers. We consider a noncooperative game in which transmitters and jammers select their transmission power to balance the transmission cost subject to delay and energy constraints. We show that jammers incur a significant performance loss when they do not have knowledge of transmitter queue states. Dynamic traffic increases the immunity <b>to</b> <b>jamming</b> attacks and gives insights into defense mechanisms.
