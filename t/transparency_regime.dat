40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental measurements, {{supported by}} particle-in-cell simulations, of ion beams accelerated from ultra thin plastic foils by high intensity laser plasma interactions in the sheath acceleration and relativistic <b>transparency</b> <b>regimes.</b> An application of accelerated proton beams is radiography, {{which can be}} used to image the fields in high intensity laser plasma interactions. Experimental measurements are presented of observations of strong electromagnetic fields associated with plasma instabilities. The use of thin foils in high intensity laser experiments is attractive, because for thin foils the radiation pressure acceleration and relativistic <b>transparency</b> <b>regimes</b> begin to dominate. For intensities 1 e 20 W/cm^ 2, and target thicknesses < 0. 5 microns, laser heating causes the target to expand so that it becomes transparent to the laser. It has been postulated that targets that are transparent during the peak of the laser pulse, will experience increased electron heating and efficient proton acceleration. Optimum acceleration conditions were observed for target thicknesses, 100 <d< 250 nm. The control of plasma instabilities is one of the ultimate prizes in high energy density physics. These effects can limit the energy absorption into a plasma, which is of interest in all areas of plasma physics. However, control of these effects could lead to the amplification of laser pulses to very high powers. In this work, a 15 ps laser pulse with intensity 1 e 18 W/cm^ 2 was focussed onto a near critical density argon gas jet. Transverse proton probing was enabled by focussing a 1 ps laser pulse with intensity 1 e 19 W/cm^ 2 onto a 20 micron gold foil. The protons imaged the electromagnetic fields and revealed a strong, low frequency, oscillatory field. Experimental evidence suggests this field is due to an ion acoustic wave driven by stimulated Brillouin scattering. Open Acces...|$|R

We present a model in which committee members have career concerns and unanimity is needed to change the status quo.

The two <b>transparency</b> <b>regimes</b> affect deliberation in different ways but lead both to a breakdown of information aggregation. However, transparency lowers the probability of an error if maintaining {{the status quo is}} the correct choice. As a consequence, the principal is better off in expectation under transparency than under secrecy if the cost of wrongly changing the status quo is high enough. We test the model's key predictions in a laboratory experiment varying the level of transparency between treatments.

We observe significant diversity in the UK bond markets, with big differences between market participants, the way they trade and the risks of trading different instruments.

Most transactions in the UK-listed bonds in our sample are carried out off-exchange. We find that trading costs depend on transaction size, credit risk profile and maturity.

A treatment dedicated to the benchmark situation (where information is fully released) is also available. Our experiment is based on subsequent framework of Morris and Shin (2002), Cornand and Heinemann (2008) and Trabelsi (2012). The predictive power of K-level reasoning is an issue that is addressed also in this paper. Our experiment indicates that -when fully disclosed- players overreact to public information and this overreaction is efficiently reduced when the degree of publicity decreases (i. e. when the fragmentation measure increases). The average weight assigned to common signal decreases over treatments, especially when we establish partial transparent strategy (i. e. fragmented information). The results provide support both for and against global games theoretical predictions. In fact, although players overreact to public signal, their behavior is inconsistent with theoretical equilibrium, which means that the destabilizing effect of public information is less pronounced experimentally than when it does in theory. This is not the case when public information is fragmented; subjects' behavior does approach equilibrium. These observations coincide with both a collective and an individual analyses of behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{administrative}} norm of transparency, which promises {{a solution to}} the problem of government secrecy, requires political advocacy organized from outside the state. The traditional approach, typically the result of organized campaigns to make the state visible to the public, has been to enact freedom of information laws (FOI) that require government disclosure and grant enforceable rights to the public. The legal solution has not proven wholly satisfactory, however. In the past two decades, numerous advocacy movements have offered different fixes to the information asymmetry problem that the administrative state creates. These alternatives now augment and sometimes compete with legal <b>transparency</b> <b>regimes.</b> This Article surveys and analyzes transparency advocacy campaigns and the “fix” that each proposes to the problems created by the state’s asymmetrical information advantage over the public. It sketches the history of four campaigns: the FOI movement in the U.

First, although these movements share a basic set of assumptions and tell a similar policy story — secrecy is a pressing administrative problem that can be fixed with the right policies and institutional arrangements — they diverge significantly in how they understand not only the problem’s causes but the state itself. Second, and as a result, the Article unveils transparency as a contested political issue which masquerades as an administrative tool.

40|$|A {{concept of}} quasiplanar one-way {{transparent}} terahertz absorbers made of linear isotropic materials is presented. The resulting structure {{consists of a}} homogeneous absorbing layer of polar dielectric, GaAs, a dispersion-free substrate, and an ultrathin frequency-selective reflector. It is demonstrated that perfect absorption can be obtained for forward illumination, along with total reflection at backward illumination and transparency windows in the adjacent bands. The design is particularized for the polaritonic gap range where permittivity of GaAs varies {{in a wide range}} and includes epsilon-near-zero and <b>transparency</b> <b>regimes.</b> The underlying physics can be explained {{with the aid of a}} unified equivalent-circuit (EC) analytical model. Perfect matching of input impedance in forward operation and, simultaneously, strong mismatch in the backward case are the universal criteria of one-way absorption. It is shown that perfect one-way absorption can be achieved at rather arbitrary permittivity values, provided these criteria are fulfilled. The EC results are in good agreement with full-wave simulations in a wide range of material and geometrical parameters. The resulting one-way absorbers are very compact and geometrically simple, and enable transparency in the neighboring frequency ranges and, hence, multifunctionality that utilizes both absorption- and transmission-related regimes.
