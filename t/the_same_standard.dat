5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach {{at his own}} alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had great difficulty recruiting to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard</b> that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play {{eight years in the}} NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E
5|$|In France, the Blue Picardy was {{recognised}} as {{a separate}} breed in 1938, and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year. The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel into Canada was Ronald Meunier of Saint-Julien, Quebec, around 1987, and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995. The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association, which uses <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard</b> as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.|$|E

This fight was fought at the lower weight of middleweight and saw Wallhead succeed with judo throw attempts early in the fight. However, Wallhead's ground game was not to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard</b> at Jonstomp's and he lost via first round submission (neck crank) after 4:20.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard</b> lest they produce audibly {{different}} sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{believe that}} stichometry became {{established}} in Athens {{sometime during the}} 5th century BCE when copying prose works became common. Stichometry is mentioned briefly in Plato's Laws (c. 347 BCE), several times in Isocrates (early to mid-4th century), and in Theopompus (late 4th to early 3rd century), but these casual references suggest the practice was already routine. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>standard</b> line was used for stichometry among the Greeks and Romans for about a thousand years until stichometry apparently fell out of use among the Byzantine Greeks in the Middle Ages as page numbers became more common.|$|E

Replacement by electric vehicles commenced in 1901; the last horse-drawn trams were withdrawn in 1915.|$|E
