25|$|The London Ecology Unit {{has advised}} the owners on {{management}} aimed to conserve natural features, whilst recognising the primary {{use of the}} cemetery as a burial ground. In recent years, {{there has been a}} policy of informed indifference to areas that are not in active use for burials. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> proliferation of natural wildlife. Large tracts of scrub and secondary woodland have been allowed to develop on former burial plots, supplementing the original plantings, and producing an exceptionally diverse habitat.|$|E

It {{may not be}} possible to attain maximum safety goals in healthcare without adversely affecting patient care in other ways. An example is blood transfusion; in recent years, {{to reduce the risk of}} transmissible infection in the blood supply, donors with only a small probability of infection have been excluded. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> critical shortage of blood for other lifesaving purposes, with a broad impact on patient care.

2500|$|Investigatory laws - {{because of}} its {{position}} as an offshore financial centre, the British Virgin Islands has regulatory responsibilities which are out of all proportion with its size or economy. [...] <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> raft of legislation designed to investigate and curb unlawful tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing. [...] The unfortunate result {{of this is a}} patchwork quilt of rules of regulations that are extremely complex to follow, even for experienced practitioners and judges. [...] Some of the laws reflect bilateral agreements with specific countries, some relate to specific times of crime, and some have generic application. [...] Unfortunately a raft of conflicting international agreements, initiatives and treaties with conflicting standards and aims, any kind of rationalisation or consolidation seems wholly improbable.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{main area}} of regulation, {{which is usually}} thought of as {{preserving}} a company's capital, is prohibition of companies providing other people with financial assistance for purchasing the company's own shares. The main problem which the regulation was intended to prevent was leveraged buyouts where, for example, an investor gets a loan from a bank, secures the loan on the company it is about to buy, and uses {{the money to buy}} the shares. It was seen as a capital problem in the sense that if the venture proved unsustainable, all the company's assets would be seized under the mortgage terms, even though technically it did not reduce a company's capital. A leveraged buy out, in effect, is the same as a bank giving someone a loan to buy a house with a 100 per cent mortgage on that house. However, in a company's case, the bank is likely to be only one among a large number of creditors, such as employees, consumers, taxpayers, or small businesses who rely on the company's trade. Only the bank will have priority for its loan, and so the risk falls wholly on other stakeholders. Financial assistance for share purchase, especially indemnifying a takeover bidder's loan, was therefore seen as encouraging risky ventures that were prone to failure, to the detriment of creditors other than the bank. It was prohibited from 1929. The prohibition remains in regard to public companies, however the Companies Act 1981 relaxed the restrictions and the Companies Act 2006 section 678, following various sources of academic criticism, repealed the prohibition for private companies altogether. It became possible to [...] "take private" [...] a public company (on its purchase, change the company from a plc to an Ltd). <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> growing number of leveraged buyouts, and an increase in the private equity industry of the UK.|$|E

60|$|I am {{often in}} the saddle since our removal to St. Ouen. I first {{commenced}} the business of exploring in the cabriolet, with my wife for a companion, during which time, several very pretty drives, of whose existence one journeying along the great roads would form no idea, were discovered. At last, as these became exhausted, I mounted, and pricked into the fields. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> better knowledge {{of the details of}} ordinary rural life, in this country, than a stranger would get by a residence, after the ordinary fashion, of years.|$|E
60|$|You {{know the}} story of the miner who {{borrowed}} a dictionary and returned it with the remark that the stories, though interesting in the main, were too various. I have the same complaint to make against Japanese scenery--twelve hours of it by train from Nagoya to Yokohama. About seven hundred years ago the king of those days built a sea-road which he called the Tokaido (or else all the sea-coast was called the Tokaido, but it's of no importance), which road endures to the present. Later on, when the English engineer appeared, he followed the Grand Trunk more or less closely, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> railway that any nation might take off their hat to. The last section of the through line from Kioto to Yokohama was only opened five days before the Professor and I honoured it with an unofficial inspection.|$|E
60|$|The Straits Settlement Council which {{lives at}} Singapur had just passed a Bill (Ordinance they call it) putting down all Chinese secret {{societies}} in the colony, which measure only awaited the Imperial assent. A little business in Singapur connected with some municipal measure for clearing away overhanging verandahs created a storm, and for three days those {{who were in the}} place say the town was entirely {{at the mercy of the}} Chinese, who rose all together and made life unpleasant for the authorities. This incident forced the Government to take serious notice of the secret societies who could so control the actions of men, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> measure which it will not be easy to enforce. A Chinaman must have a secret society of some kind. He has been bred up in a country where they were necessary to his comfort, his protection, and the maintenance of his scale of wages from time immemorial, and he will carry them with him as he will carry his opium and his coffin.|$|E
