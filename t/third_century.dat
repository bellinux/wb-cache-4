5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the <b>Third</b> <b>Century,</b> with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} <b>third</b> <b>century.</b> The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E

5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the <b>third</b> <b>century</b> BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.|$|E

5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the <b>Third</b> <b>Century.</b> Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings.

5|$|A Roman {{colonnade}} {{was built}} in the <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule.

5|$|By the <b>third</b> <b>century</b> AD, Palmyra was {{a prosperous}} {{regional}} center reaching {{the apex of}} its power in the 260s, when Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.|$|E

Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another rebellion, and, except for the Crisis of the <b>Third</b> <b>Century,</b> remained loyal to Rome until {{the fall of the}} empire in 476.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid <b>third</b> <b>century,</b> a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E

The tablets were sent to the British Museum, but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake's other historical artefacts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the fact}} that the concept of God's redemptive love in Jesus was {{prevalent}} even among writers in the early church resulted in some scholars' claiming that the moral influence theory was universally taught in the second and <b>third</b> <b>centuries.</b> See, for example: the Epistle to Diognetus, The Shepherd of Hermas, and works by Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Clement of Alexandria Hippolytus of Rome, Origen, Irenaeus, and Arnobius. Some writers also taught other atonement models in conjunction with it, but Wallace and Rusk claim that the majority of Christian writers in the second and <b>third</b> <b>centuries</b> AD expressed only the moral influence view.|$|R
