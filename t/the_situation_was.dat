5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, {{specifically}} to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman.

5|$|But on {{the wings}} <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> different. Qanatir, {{commanding}} the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
5|$|De Candolle, in {{the first}} {{systematic}} taxonomy of Narcissus, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties, {{and it was not}} till the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus, Narcissus.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
5|$|No such attack came. The Germans brought fresh {{reserves}} {{to cover the}} gap (Menen–Ypres). This nearly cut the Belgians off from the British.

5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>was</b> aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population.
