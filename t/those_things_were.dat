As the show built towards its thirtieth anniversary in 2016, Hossington revealed {{in an interview that}} the special episode will do something [...] "no other show has done before." [...] In the interview, Hossington said: [...] "I'm very keen to make it a big event! We spoke about live episodes and things like that, but we decided that none of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> satisfying as they've all been done. What we're doing, no other show has done before..." [...] Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary. It was later revealed by Charles Venn in an interview with What's on TV on 8 June 2016, that his character, Nurse Jacob Masters, would be {{at the forefront of the}} anniversary episode. Venn said in the interview his character would play [...] "an integral part" [...] in the 110-minute special anniversary episode. Venn also went on to say that the cast and crew brand the thirtieth anniversary episode Casualty: The Movie.|$|E

Someone would simply be lying on the floor half dead, and I would [...] with this funny little thing that was a prop. I could read all his vital signs. They can pretty much do that [...] nowadays. There were times that we were playing with props that didn't read anything — I just had a bunch of dialogue to say after. We had the Commlock. All of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> on the verge of happening anyway. Now we're way past it. When we made it, 1999 seemed so far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, after a {{television}} series {{extension of the}} One-Shot Agent Carter was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked {{about the possibility of}} him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, [...] "I get to mix {{a lot of things that}} don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." [...] He researched [...] "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." [...] This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, [...] "which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".|$|E

60|$|I now gave {{over any}} more {{thoughts}} of the ship, or of any thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> of small use to me.|$|E
60|$|Could {{anything}} be {{clearer than}} the Uitlander's {{statement of the}} grievances and oppressions under which they were suffering?

60|$|By {{this time}} I had dressed {{me as well}} as I could; for though I had good linen left still, yet I had but a poor head-dress, and no knots, but old fragments; no necklace, no earrings; all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> gone long ago for mere bread.|$|E

60|$|Father Conmee {{began to}} walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who {{stood in the doorway}} of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and {{perceived}} the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{work of the}} {{guardian}} spirits had already begun. They say that all {{who took part in}} the search died, of a terrible pestilence that broke out. Since that time, the place has been accursed. Once or twice, kings have sent bodies of troops to search; and they say that some could never find the temple, but wandered about the forest for days, searching in vain for it. Others found so thick a darkness, like the blackest of smoke, filling the forest, that even the bravest dare not enter. I say not that <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> so; I only say that these are the stories that have come down to us." ...|$|E
60|$|But by {{how much}} the greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> to our {{thoughts}} while we were at sea, by so much the greater was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told me he dreamed {{that he had a}} very heavy load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found that {{he was not able to}} stand long under it; but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before him shewing all smooth and plain: and truly it was so; we were all like men who had a load taken off their backs.|$|E
60|$|What fruit had ye then in <b>those</b> <b>things</b> whereof ye <b>are</b> now ashamed? {{for the end}} of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>is</b> death.

6000|$|... "Though all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> in my mind, {{they were}} in the background. They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was {{thinking}} of my lady. An aching distress filled me. For {{the first time she had}} owned herself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear her sobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had need of weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was well, I thought, that she would weep and rest, and then we would toil on again, for I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I can see her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek.|$|E
60|$|Certain it is, the {{greatest}} {{part of the}} poor or families who formerly lived by their labour, or by retail trade, lived now on charity; and had there not been prodigious sums of money given by charitable, well-minded Christians {{for the support of}} such, the city could never have subsisted. There were, no question, accounts kept of their charity, and of the just distribution of it by the magistrates. But as such multitudes of those very officers died through whose hands it was distributed, and also that, as I have been told, most of the accounts of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> lost in the great fire which happened in the very next year, and which burnt even the chamberlain's office and many of their papers, so I could never come at the particular account, which I used great endeavours to have seen.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{her fault}} {{if she did not}} overdo these history, but perhaps it was all true about the number of girls who were ready and willing to marry him. It might even be true, though she had no direct {{authority}} for saying it, that he had made up his mind never to marry, and that was the reason why he felt himself so safe in being the nicest sort of friend. He was safe, Miss Rasmith philosophized, but whether other people were so safe was a different question. There were girls who were said to be dying for him; but of course <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> always said about a handsome young minister. She had frankly taken him on his own ground, from the beginning, and she believed that this was what he liked. At any rate, they had agreed that they were never to be anything but the best of friends, and they always had been.|$|E
60|$|We {{are neither}} to regret the past, nor rest {{satisfied}} in the present; but, like St. Paul, forgetting <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> behind us, and reaching onward to <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> before us, press forward, each and all, to the prize of our high calling in Jesus Christ.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} were. And yet I can't say that I do. <b>Those</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> very serious with girls. I shouldn't like Tom {{to have been}} going to see those people if he meant nothing by it." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{had several}} {{meetings}} after this, in which still {{we had so}} many preliminaries {{to go through that}} we scarce ever bordered upon the main subject. Once, indeed, he said something of it, and I put it off with a kind of a jest. [...] "Alas!" [...] says I, [...] "those things are out of the question now; 'tis almost two ages since <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> talked between us," [...] says I. [...] "You see I am grown an old woman since that." [...] Another time he gave a little push at it again, and I laughed again. [...] "Why, what dost thou talk of?" [...] said I in a formal way. [...] "Dost thou not see I am turned Quaker? I cannot speak of those things now." [...] "Why," [...] says he, [...] "the Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well. Besides," [...] says he, [...] "the Quakers' dress does not ill become you," [...] and so jested with me again, and so it went off for a third time. However, I began to be kind to him in process of time, as they call it, and we grew very intimate; and if the following accident had not unluckily intervened, I had certainly married him, or consented to marry him, the very next time he had asked me.|$|E
60|$|Helladius [262] tells us, that a {{man called}} Oes, who {{appeared}} in the Red Sea with {{the tail of a}} fish, so they painted a sea-man, taught Astronomy and Letters: and Hyginus, [263] that Euhadnes, who came out of the Sea in Chaldæa, taught the Chaldæans Astrology the first of any man; he means Astronomy: and Alexander Polyhistor [264] tells us from Berosus, that Oannes taught the Chaldæans Letters, Mathematicks, Arts, Agriculture, Cohabitation in Cities, and the Construction of Temples; and that several such men came thither successively. Oes, Euhadnes, and Oannes, seem to be the same name a little varied by corruption; and this name seems to have been given in common to several sea-men, who came thither from time to time, and by consequence were merchants, and frequented those seas with their merchandise, or else fled from their enemies: so that Letters, Astronomy, Architecture and Agriculture, came into Chaldæa by sea, and were carried thither by sea-men, who frequented the Persian Gulph, and came thither from time to time, after all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> practised in other countries whence they came, and by consequence in the days of Ammon and Sesac, David and Solomon, and their successors, or not long before. The Chaldæans indeed made Oannes older than the flood of Xisuthrus, but the Egyptians made Osiris as old, and I make them contemporary.|$|E
6000|$|The Emperor {{never seems}} to have grasped the true forces at work in these {{gathering}} troubles. He was for his time and station an exceptionally worthy man, {{and he seems to}} have taken the religious dissensions that were tearing Europe into warring fragments as genuine theological differences. He gathered diets and councils in futile attempts at reconciliation. Formulæ and confessions were tried over. The student of German history must struggle with the details of the Religious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the Diet of Ratisbon, the Interim of Augsburg, and the like. Here we do but mention them as details in the worried life of this culminating Emperor. As a matter of fact, hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in Europe seems to have been acting in good faith. The widespread religious trouble of the world, the desire of the common people for truth and social righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time, all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy. Henry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book against heresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of [...] "Defender of the Faith," [...] being anxious to divorce his first wife in favour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn, and wishing also to loot the vast wealth of the church in England, joined the company of Protestant princes in 1530. Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to the Protestant side.|$|E
