Honig and Teunissen were {{dropped from the}} leading group on the second climb of the Côte de Bellaire.

5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> m1.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} ventral {{and a little}} behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the body. The foregut, stomach and {{intestine}} run a little below the midline {{of the body and}} the anus is {{at the tip of the}} tail. Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the mouth, but still under <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.|$|E

5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E

5|$|Skulls {{of early}} tyrannosauroids were long, low and lightly constructed, {{similar to other}} coelurosaurs, while later forms had taller and more massive skulls. Despite the {{differences}} in form, certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary bone is very tall, blunting <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the snout, a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids. The nasal bones are characteristically fused together, arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface. The premaxillary teeth at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the upper jaw are shaped differently {{from the rest of}} the teeth, smaller in size and with a D-shaped cross section. In the lower jaw, a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint, except in the basal Guanlong.|$|E
