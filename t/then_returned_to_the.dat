5|$|Melbourne {{arrived in}} Sydney with the {{survivors}} on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, {{was moved to}} Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. Once this was completed, Melbourne was removed while the new bow {{was put in place}} in the drydock; Melbourne was <b>then</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drydock where her new bow was fitted.

They searched the building and <b>then</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recovery work.|$|E

These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
5|$|When {{the battle}} officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made {{significant}} advances {{but had been}} unable to achieve a breakthrough.

After the Second Battle of Bullecourt (3–17 May), the Arras sector <b>then</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stalemate that typified most of the war on the Western Front, except for attacks on the Hindenburg Line and around Lens, culminating in the Canadian Battle of Hill 70 (15–25 August).|$|E

On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E
