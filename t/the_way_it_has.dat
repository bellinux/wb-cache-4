The Mongolian endonym is Böö mörgöl (Бөө мөргөл). In the earliest known stages it was intricately tied to all other aspects of social life and to the tribal organization of Mongolian society. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> become influenced by and mingled with Buddhism. During the socialist years of the twentieth century it was heavily repressed and has since made a comeback.|$|E

500|$|The {{measuring}} system for gauging a film's success {{is based on}} unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a [...] "top film of all time", so there is little incentive {{to switch to a}} more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.|$|E

Alan McKee, a university film and television professor, said that usually subscription television channels take risks in portraying storylines like Chris's. He added [...] "Commercial TV is not about risk taking, it is about entertainment for the broadest possible audience. But attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that". Holy Soap said Chris's most memorable moment was [...] "Announcing to his entire class that he was gay." [...] Anthony D. Langford from website, AfterElton said he found it [...] "humorous" [...] that Neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman Chris is compared to Andrew. He said [...] "It's like they're almost saying if you're a nice guy who's not all over your girlfriend you must be gay. But on television that's usually the case".

The announcement was made public on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of [...] "How to Save a Life". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained how the decision could have been made when he had just renewed his contract as he asserted on the natural developments leading up to his exit from the long-running series. He said, [...] "It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded, and it just naturally came to be. Which was pretty good. I like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> all played out." [...] He went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, as he said, [...] "Things happened very quickly, where we were like, Oh this is where it’s going to go.

500|$|Other decided cases {{also do not}} {{indicate}} whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been developed in the UK. In Siah Mooi Guat, another argument the applicant raised {{was that she had}} a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit. Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983), a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong, from the case at hand. In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation. In the present case, no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations. No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue". Thus, the judge did not discuss the detailed legal rules to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right.|$|E
500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
