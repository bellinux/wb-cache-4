5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, the Fascist Party in Italy {{tightened}} its control. National {{education policy}} took {{a major step}} towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism, and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> God.|$|E

25|$|With Murray’s support, in {{the autumn}} of 1916 Robertson had {{resisted}} attempts to send as many as 4,000 men to Rabegh to help the nascent Arab Revolt, stressing that logistical support would bring the total up to 16,000 men, enough to prevent Murray’s advance on El Arish. Robertson accused the ministers (8 December 1916) of “attaching as much importance to a few scallywags in Arabia as I imagine <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> the German attack on Ypres two years ago”, {{but for the first time}} ministers contemplated overruling him. Encouraged by hope that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, Robertson authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, AECL noted that each reactor sale would employ 3,600 Canadians {{and result in}} $300 million in balance-of-payments income. These sales efforts were aimed {{primarily}} at countries being run by dictatorships or similar, a fact that led to serious concerns in parliament. These efforts also led to a scandal when it was discovered millions of dollars {{had been given to}} foreign sales agents, with little or no record of who they were, or what <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> earn the money. This led to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation after questions were raised about sales efforts in Argentina, and new regulations on full disclosure of fees for future sales.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln {{continued}} to advocate his Louisiana Plan {{as a model}} for all states up until his assassination on April 14, 1865. The plan successfully started the Reconstruction process of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment in all states. Lincoln is typically portrayed as taking the moderate position and fighting the Radical positions. There is considerable debate on how well Lincoln, had he lived, would have handled Congress during the Reconstruction process that took place after the Civil War ended. One historical camp argues that Lincoln's flexibility, pragmatism, and superior political skills with Congress would have solved Reconstruction with far less difficulty. The other camp believes the Radicals would have attempted to impeach Lincoln, just as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> his successor, Andrew Johnson, in 1868.|$|E

25|$|Cricket in Myanmar {{dates back}} to when Burma was a {{province}} of British India. The British brought the game there, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> the rest of India, and the game progressed to the level where the Marylebone Cricket Club played two two-day first class matches there on a tour to India in 1926/1927. The first of these was played at the Gymkhana ground in Rangoon against a Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team. That game was drawn with the MCC on top after forcing the home side to follow-on. The second game was against the Burma team themselves at the BAA Ground, also in Rangoon. The MCC won this game restricting Burma to low scores in both their innings, and only having to chase 7 runs to win in their second innings. This remains the country's only first class game.|$|E
25|$|Although Cather {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} journalist, she made a {{distinction}} between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather's work is often marked by its nostalgic tone, her subject matter and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Some critics have charged Cather with being {{out of touch with}} her times and failing to use more experimental techniques, such as stream of consciousness, in her writing. However, others have pointed out that Cather could follow no other literary path but her own: She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style. Cather's style is not the accumulative cataloguing of the journalists, nor the fragmentary atomism of psychological associations.|$|E
25|$|The Fascist {{government}} {{endorsed a}} stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, {{which was a}} serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance. The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue of physical fitness and began an agenda that demanded that Italians become physically healthy.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry {{began with}} the teams' first meeting in 1991, with annual {{meetings}} beginning in 2005 when the Knights entered C-USA. Playing in the same division East Carolina and UCF were permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure. In recent years, the match between UCF and East Carolina has determined {{the winner of the}} Eastern Division. In 2007, UCF's only conference loss came {{at the hands of the}} Pirates. UCF won the division anyway, and ultimately took the conference title. In 2008, UCF was looking like they were going to ruin East Carolina's dreams of the Eastern Division title like <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> Marshall, but with a late rally, the Pirates won in overtime making the Pirates the first C-USA team to beat UCF in Spectrum Stadium. A loss at East Carolina also determined them as the Eastern Division champions in 2009, while a UCF win at home was the difference in 2010. In the final scheduled meeting of the two schools in 2012, it would be UCF that would win 40–20, despite falling behind 14–0 early on. As of now, the final count in the series in 9–4 in favor of East Carolina. The rivalry resumed when the Pirates joined UCF in the American Athletic Conference in 2014. UCF won as time expired on a 51-yard Hail Mary pass from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. This allowed for them to win back to back conference championships. ECU would blow out a winless UCF team the next year, 44-7. One year later, UCF would beat ECU 47-29 under first-year head coach, Scott Frost, against ECU's first-year head coach, Scottie Montgomery.|$|E
