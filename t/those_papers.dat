500|$|Admiral d'Estaing {{rejected}} Macartney's proposed {{terms of}} capitulations, countering {{with a list}} of articles that he had drafted. Macartney found d'Estaing's proposed articles [...] "not merely unprecedented and humiliating, but so ensnaring and uncertain in their nature, extent, and aim that they might at any time supply a pretext for taking away the lives, together with the fortunes, of the capitulants." [...] His council was unanimous in rejecting the proposed capitulation, and the British chose to surrender unconditionally instead. [...] As a consequence, d'Estaing permitted his troops to pillage St. George's. [...] Among the items taken or destroyed were most of Macartney's silver and plate, much of his clothing, and his personal papers. The latter came as a particularly harsh blow to the governor, for copies of <b>those</b> <b>papers</b> sent to St. Lucia with his wife for safeguarding were destroyed by fire. [...] When d'Estaing invited Macartney to dine with him, the governor apologized for his garb, noting that the coat he was wearing was the only one left him.

500|$|In {{the early}} days of street newspapers, people were often {{reluctant}} to buy from homeless vendors for fear that they were being scammed.

Papers such as StreetWise have in the past been criticized as [...] "grim" [...] and for having vendors that are too loud and intrusive. Some newspapers sell well but may not be widely read, as many people will donate to vendors without buying, or buy the newspaper and then throw it away.

500|$|Since my {{work was}} announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous {{of which is}} one {{compiled}} for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, {{it is evident that}} they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of <b>those</b> <b>papers,</b> which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alternatively, the {{increase}} in multi-authorship might be {{a consequence of the}} way scientists are evaluated. Traditionally, scientists were judged by the number of papers they published, and later by the impact of <b>those</b> <b>papers.</b> The former is an estimate of quantity and the latter of quality. Both methods were adequate when single authorship was the norm, but vastly inflate individual contribution when papers are multi-authored. When each author claims each paper and each citation as his/her own, papers and citations are magically multiplied by the number of authors. Furthermore, there is no cost to giving authorship to individuals who made only minor contribution and there is an incentive to do so. Hence, the system rewards heavily multi-authored papers. This problem is openly acknowledged, and it could easily be [...] "corrected" [...] by dividing each paper and its citations by the number of authors.|$|E
