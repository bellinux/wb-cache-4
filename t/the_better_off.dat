5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} Przywóz, Wieluń County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. <b>The</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in sheaths, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Kraków County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as {{the first half of the}} 6th century.|$|E

25|$|Meusebach found Carlshafen (Indianola) to be {{insufficient}} as a port of entry, and {{the route}} to New Braunfels isolated. He was told Prince Solms chose to keep the Germans from interacting with any Americans. Meusebach found Prince Solms in Galveston trying to return to Germany, detained by authorities for unpaid bills. Meusebach made a full accounting of the situation to the Verein, adding that he felt the less the Verein {{had to do with}} Henry Fisher and Burchard Miller <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> everyone would be.|$|E

25|$|Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss {{animal rights}} {{in terms of}} animals being {{permitted}} to lead a life appropriate for their kind. Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes {{the interests of the}} worse off more important than those of <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off.</b> Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach.|$|E
25|$|The Dual Contracts {{resulted}} in the expansion of New York City; people moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city’s congested areas. They helped lower high population areas and probably helped saves lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920. People were allowed to move to better parts the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs.

2500|$|It {{was then}} the landowning families—the Rosses, the Crompton-Stansfields and the Wainmans—took {{advantage}} of the demand for housing by selling their less productive land on Low Moor and High Moor. [...] Houses for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> were built in Sunny Bank and Hall Royd in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s.

2500|$|Whilst {{a number}} of party members are pro-European, some free-marketeers are Eurosceptic, perceiving most EU {{regulations}} as interference in the free market and/or a threat to British sovereignty. EU centralisation also conflicts with the localist ideals that have grown in prominence within the party in recent years. Rare Thatcherite Europhiles included Leon Brittan. Many take inspiration from Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, in which she declared that [...] "we have not successfully rolled back the frontiers {{of the state in}} Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level". A number of free-market Conservatives have signed <b>the</b> <b>Better</b> <b>Off</b> Out pledge to leave the EU. Thatcherites and economic liberals in the party tend to support Atlanticism, something exhibited between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.|$|E
2500|$|Many notable webcomic creators are {{actively}} diversifying their income streams {{in order to}} not be dependent on one source of income, many even deemphasizing webcomics. Brady Dale of The New York Observer noticed while calling out to professional webcomic artists that though almost all of his respondents believed that their webcomic created a [...] "base of notoriety" [...] for them, they also all believed that the [...] "less [...] relied on [...] original source for financial support, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{they would all be}} over time." [...] For instance, the creators of Cyanide and Happiness went on to create animation in the form of The Cyanide & Happiness Show, and their webcomic is no longer their primary source of income. Dorothy Gambrell (Cat and Girl) explained that [...] "the business of webcomics rolled along smoothly until the great T-shirt crash of 2008," [...] and that the 2010s offers creators more opportunities than the 2000s did. Creators such as Gambrell, Drew Fairweather (Toothpaste for Dinner), and Zack Weinersmith (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) all do work unrelated to their webcomics.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford Law Professor Richard Thompson Ford, {{reviewing}} Intellectuals and Race for The American Interest, wrote [...] "Too much of Intellectuals and Race reads ... with overly tendentious and snide {{attacks on}} caricatured liberal theories. This detracts from the fair and often too quickly dismissed points Sowell makes." [...] Thompson says [...] "The {{book is a}} response to the common intuition that inequality between the races must be caused by discrimination or exploitation of the disadvantaged group by <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off,</b> necessitating reparations or corrective intervention in the market economy. [...] Sowell insists instead that differences in productive capabilities explain the differences in outcomes." [...] Thompson writes, [...] "Rather like Booker T. Washington," [...] Sowell argues that today's racial inequalities are the fault of a black culture that encourages the most talented to squander their time and energy mastering esoteric social theories that blame others for their problems, rather than learning the practical skills that will help them solve those problems themselves. He complains that a malcontented 'intelligentsia have demanded an equality of outcome and of social recognition, irrespective of the skills, behavior or performance of the group to which they belong or on whose behalf they spoke.'" [...] Sowell, Thompson finds, [...] "downplays the toll that American racism has taken, not only on black fortunes but on American civic culture and politics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Income tax {{was first}} {{introduced}} in Great Britain in 1799 {{as a means of}} subsidising the Napoleonic Wars. While not imposed in Ireland, the rate of 10% on the total income, with reductions only possible in incomes below £200, immediately hit <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off.</b> The tax was repealed for a brief period in 1802 during a cessation in hostilities with the French, but its reintroduction in 1803 set the pattern for all future taxation in Britain. While the tax was again repealed following the victory at Waterloo, the advantages of such taxation were now obvious. In 1841 following the election victory of Sir Robert Peel, the exchequer was so depleted that the tax made a surprise return on incomes above £150 while still known as a [...] "temporary tax". It was never again to be repealed. Throughout the 19th century, tax thresholds remained high, permitting the wealthy to live comfortably while paying minimal tax; until in 1907, H. H. Asquith introduced 'differentiation', a tax designed to be more punitive to those with investments rather than an earned income, which directly hit the aristocracy and gentry. Two years later, Lloyd George in his People’s Budget of 1909 announced plans for a super-tax for the rich, but the bill introducing the tax was defeated in the House of Lords. Any respite this defeat gave the owners of large country houses, many of them members of the House of Lords, was to be brief and ultimately self-defeating. The bill's defeat led to the 1911 Parliament Act which removed the Lords' power of veto.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{were divided}} on the band's use of trumpet in [...] "Lead Poisoning" [...] and {{synthesizer}} in [...] "Draculina" [...] and [...] "Eating Me Alive". Rob Hope of Rock Lifestyle said of these elements that [...] "At first you may jump back and scratch your head, {{but after a few}} listens you realize it's pulled off well and is quite likeable." [...] Beringer remarked that the horns [...] "fill the background nicely", while Heisel felt that [...] "The goofy, NOFX-esque trumpet solo [...] turns a decent song into a throwaway track". Similarly, Beringer felt that the use of synthesizers in [...] "Eating Me Alive" [...] "puts a little glam into the band's gothic style", while Heisel called them [...] "awful", stating that they [...] "completely ruin" [...] the song, and that [...] "Draculina" [...] should have been left off of the album and relegated to a B-side: [...] "seriously, the sooner this band stop playing around with keyboards, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> we'll be". Both had praise for specific songs on the album, however: Beringer called [...] "The American Scream" [...] "the ideal Trio song; it's totally dynamic and enthralling, and should be a quick fan favorite." [...] Heisel said that Andriano's [...] "Dine, Dine My Darling" [...] "is exactly what makes the Trio a compelling punk band–it's loaded with a huge hook, honest lyrics and a wink to their forefathers". He singled out [...] "Dead on the Floor" [...] as the album's finest track, calling it [...] "a not-too-distant musical cousin from Goddamnits 'San Francisco', with some of Skiba's most heartbroken lyrics." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone remarked on the band's return to their [...] "bleak-Blink-182 roots" [...] after the [...] "power-ballad overreach" [...] of Agony & Irony.|$|E
