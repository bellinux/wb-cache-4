5|$|The Cold War and its {{events have}} left a {{significant}} legacy. It {{is often referred to}} in popular culture, especially in media featuring themes of espionage (e.g., the internationally successful James Bond movie franchise) and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 essentially ended the Cold War. However, {{the end of the}} Cold War failed to end <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon use, although global fears of nuclear war reduced substantially.

25|$|Despite its {{failures}} in practice, the strategic bombing concept of targeting crucial industrial bottlenecks became in 1947 the first core {{doctrine of the}} independent United States Air Force.

25|$|The Cold War and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{holocaust}} {{are major}} themes introduced in Rod Serling's original Planet of the Apes script. The films are apocalyptic and dystopian, and portray the era's tensions leading to world destruction. The films critique {{both sides of}} the war, with the oppressive ape society and the mutant city featuring traits of both Western culture and the Soviet bloc. According to Greene, Cold War themes were central to the first two films and some spinoff media, but were less significant in the later sequels, which foregrounded racial conflict instead.|$|E

This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.|$|E

500|$|Galina Brezhneva, Brezhnev's disgraced daughter, was {{constantly}} {{followed by two}} burly guards. Andropov, Brezhnev's successor as general secretary, embraced Viktoria Brezhneva but allegedly turned his back to Galina. This claim has been disputed, with a Time article dating back to 1982 claiming that Andropov embraced both, and not just Viktoria. Even so, during Andropov's fifteen-month rule Galina stopped appearing in public. At the funeral, Andropov praised Brezhnev for his [...] "struggle for the relaxation of international tensions and for delivering mankind from <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> war" [...] and his détente policy. Andrei Kirilenko, a leading Politburo member, burst into tears when confronting Viktoria at the funeral.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} a number <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> whistleblowers, often nuclear engineers, who have {{identified}} safety concerns at nuclear power plants in the United States. In 1976 Gregory Minor, Richard Hubbard, and Dale Bridenbaugh [...] "blew the whistle" [...] on safety problems at nuclear power plants in the United States. The three nuclear engineers gained the attention of journalists and their disclosures about <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power had a significant impact. George Galatis was a senior nuclear engineer who reported safety problems at the Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant, relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1995.

[...] One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: [...] "Khrushchev {{made it clear that he}} was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road..." [...] He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that [...] "'if any mad man wanted war, we , the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'" ...|$|E
