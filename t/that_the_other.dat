5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{party to the}} marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no reason to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August Garbage's involvement was confirmed in a press release from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record label, which would release the soundtrack and the single. Although Music Week reported that Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Sharleen Spiteri, Björk and Melanie C were rejected by the producers before Garbage was chosen, Arnold denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> artists had auditioned; the single was suitable only for a film, and was not created with a particular artist in mind.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{then goes}} to the Android's Dungeon, {{with only a few}} cents extra, where he runs into Milhouse and Martin. He talks them into pooling their money and buying the comic book. Since none of them want to let the comic book out of their sights, they decide to spend the night {{together}} in Bart's treehouse. The three get progressively more paranoid and Bart becomes convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two are conspiring against him.|$|E
25|$|Jackson and Williams (1985) {{proposed}} {{that if someone}} feels <b>that</b> <b>others</b> in <b>the</b> group are slacking or that others will slack, he will lower his effort to match <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> This can occur whether it is apparent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are slacking or if someone simply believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group is slacking. For example, in the Latane et al. study above, if a participant heard <b>the</b> <b>others</b> making less noise than anticipated, he could have lowered his effort {{in an attempt to}} equal <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> rather than aiming for the optimum.|$|R

He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism to conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed {{is that if}} {{it is possible to}} determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E

5|$|In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court {{announced}} the following test: {{the government may}} separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> does not. Blockburger is the default rule, unless the legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on Leicester's chances were shared by Gary Lineker, who said that N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|E
5|$|King Artaxerxes {{thinks it}} {{just that the}} cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Greek cities, both small and great, should be left independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But {{whichever}} of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.|$|E
5|$|Later, Dr. Crusher reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> parasites, {{including}} the one inside Quinn, have shriveled up and died, as {{they were unable to}} survive without the mother-creature that had been inhabiting Remmick. As they help to settle matters with Starfleet headquarters, they find that before Remmick was killed, he had sent a signal to a distant quadrant of the galaxy. The signal is thought to be a homing beacon.|$|E

50|$|On {{a related}} note, Spider-Man had earlier {{met up with}} Beast at an old church, where they {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other's</b> cocoon made entirely of webbing was empty; whatever gestated in there had been long gone.|$|R
5|$|Mulder and Scully then {{interview}} Curt Brunjes (Jonathan Whittaker), {{the racist}} {{owner of a}} copy shop {{across the street from}} the market where Isaac worked.

Scully mentions that there is a rumor spreading that Isaac has risen from the grave to avenge his death. The two boys, who are eavesdropping on the conversation, are terrified at this prospect.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 1780, Arnold {{obtained}} {{command of}} West Point. On August 15, {{he received a}} coded letter from André with Clinton's final offer: £20,000 and no indemnification for his losses. Neither side knew for some days <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> was in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of A Ghost Is Born, Wilco's fifth studio album, multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band to pursue a career in theater production. To replace him, the band added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to their lineup. The lineup was {{expanded}} because lead singer Jeff Tweedy was concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members were multi-tasking on instruments. This made performing material live from Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot difficult. While touring in support of Ghost, Wilco decided to record their first live album.|$|E

5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged {{to the point of}} illegibility.

5|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Scrap 60 Productions team, consisted of Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano, Eddie Wohl, and Steve Regina. The front cover was designed by comic book artist Alex Ross. Vocalist John Bush stated that the band was honored to work with Ross, who also did the artwork for their previous pair of recordings. Bush explained that the band gave Ross a complete freedom over {{the concept of the}} artwork. Apart from suggesting the album's title as an idea, Bush said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members had not participated much in creating the cover art.|$|E
