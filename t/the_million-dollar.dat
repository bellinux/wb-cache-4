5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> question without using any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but rather {{to tell him he}} was going to win the game. Carpenter answered the question correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E

25|$|As a result, many contestants' reputations were tarnished. In 1960, the United States Congress {{amended the}} Communications Act of 1934 to {{prohibit}} the fixing of quiz shows. As {{a result of}} that action, many networks canceled their existing quiz shows and replaced them with a higher number of public service programs. Most networks also imposed a winnings limit on their existing and future game shows, which would eventually be removed by inflation and the rise of <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> jackpot game shows starting in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Almost all crickets farmed in the United States are Acheta domesticus. The American cricket {{industry}} does not disclose its earnings; in 1989 Huber et al. estimated it at $3,000,000 annually. Most of these crickets were not pets, but fish bait and animal food. The largest shipment, of 445 metric tons, {{was reported by}} Purina Mills in 1985. A decade later individual cricket farms like the Bassett Cricket Ranch in Visalia, California easily surpassed <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> mark. By 1998 Bassett shipped two million crickets a week. The Fluker Cricket Farm in Louisiana exceeded $5,000,000 in annual sales in 2001 and became a staple subject of American business school textbooks.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the U.S. version {{changed its}} format so that contestants were {{required}} to answer questions within a set time limit. The time limits were 15 seconds for questions 1–5, 30 seconds for questions 6-10, and 45 seconds for questions 11-14. After each of the 14 questions were answered correctly, the remaining time after giving an answer was banked for <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> question. The clock for each question began counting down immediately after all of the question was revealed, and was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. Contestants who exceeded the time limit were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point. The clock was later adopted by other international versions; for example, the British version adopted it on 3 August 2010, and the Indian version adopted it on 11 October the same year.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{promotion}} {{was considered}} to be very successful. Rosen noted that they considered <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> goal as a best-case scenario, but once the sale actually started, [...] "it was immediately clear that we were on to something". Rosen would later attribute part of the success to Ars Technica writer Mike Thomspon, stating that he [...] "immediately saw the potential" [...] of the Bundle in an article written for the website just prior to the Bundle's sale period. Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were willing to buy was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than just feeling entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact with you in a different manner". The source for the promotion's website has been requested of Wolfire by several other groups, according to Rosen; Rosen continues to believe that many similar charitable sales {{can be seen in the}} future from the Humble Bundle's success. For future Bundles, Rosen desires to include lesser-known titles in contrast to World of Goo and Braid, but has had to already reject some developers' requests to be included in a Bundle, claiming the games' quality may tarnish the Humble Indie Bundle branding. Instead, he believes smaller games with no wide profile and are [...] "legitimately good" [...] would be ideal for inclusion in future Bundles.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Congress {{established}} the independent Securities and Exchange Commission to end irresponsible market manipulations {{and dissemination of}} false information about securities. In the 21st century, the SEC {{remains one of the}} most powerful government agencies. Its predecessor had been ineffective in 1933-34 as part of another agency and the financial market was dying. Roosevelt named Kennedy to head the SEC clean up of Wall Street. The New Deal attracted many of the nation's most talented young lawyers. Kennedy also appointed a hard-driving team with a mission for reform. They included William O. Douglas, and Abe Fortas, whom were later named to the U.S. Supreme Court. [...] The SEC had four missions. First and foremost was to restore investor confidence in the securities market which had collapsed on account of its questionability, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, the SEC had to get rid of the penny ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was essential. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear set of rules, deadlines and guidelines that all companies had to follow. The main challenge faced by the young lawyers was drafting precise rules. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He trumpete for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again. Kennedy's reforming work as SEC Chairman was widely praised on all sides, as investors realized the SEC was protecting their interests. He left the SEC in 1935 to take over the Maritime Commission, which built on his wartime experience in running a major shipyard.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Roosevelt {{named his}} friend Joseph P. Kennedy, a self-made multimillionaire [...] {{financier}} {{and leader of}} the Irish community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough to clean it up. Two of the other five commissioners were James M. Landis (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and Ferdinand Pecora (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of brilliant young lawyers, including William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and operating mode for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had {{to get rid of the}} penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end <b>the</b> <b>million-dollar</b> insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.|$|E
