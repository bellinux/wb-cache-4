40|$|The paper {{presents}} modelling of an {{articulated vehicle}} {{by means of}} joint coordinates, which enable us to describe {{the motion of the}} system with a minimal number of generalised coordinates. We consider a model of a semi-trailer formulated using joint coordinates and homogenous transformations. Such an approach enables us to treat the vehicle as a kinematic chain consisting of three single units with an even number of wheels. This means that a single unit vehicle has a structure of an open kinematic chain in a tree form. The contact of wheels with the road is modelled by the Dugoff-Uffelman model. The model is validated by comparing the simulation results with those obtained from experimental measurements. Friction in the fifth wheel is one of the important parameters influencing the motion of a <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> a <b>semi-trailer.</b> The model presented enables us to analyse different models of friction in the fifth wheel. The influence of those friction models on the results is presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{semi-trailer}} chassis {{was usually}} treated as rigid body in many existing literature, which {{would lead to}} larger deviation from actual situation. A rigid semi-trailer chassis model was built and flexiblized based on the modal test results in this paper. The <b>tractor</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> <b>with</b> flexible chassis was utilized to simulate the rollover scenarios on high speed obstacle avoidance under emergency based on virtual prototyping. The simulation results were compared to the simplified 5 -DOF, 3 -wheel linear vehicle model. It was revealed that the wheels on flexible chassis {{are more inclined to}} be got pushed up and away from the road, which is likely to occur rollover. The actual roll angle of semi-trailer is proposed to be measured from several positions, and it should be a weighted value...|$|R
40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> a <b>semi-trailer</b> based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the rear underrun protection device of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking brake indicator on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the rear underrun protection were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The underrun protection device has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, rear underrun protection is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the master brake cylinder and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

50|$|From 1937 the US {{armed forces}} had bought Mack's {{commercial}} E series in small orders, the EH {{was the largest}} model. In 1942 large numbers of modified trucks were supplied under Lend-Lease to Britain and many could be seen carrying the L or H-numbers of the British War Department. They differed from the commercial type by lacking chrome trim and nameplates, and were fitted with a military style cargo body with canvas cover. They were painted olive drab all over. 510 EH, 70 EHU, 140 EHT <b>with</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> ST20, 180 EHUT <b>with</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> ST20 were delivered.|$|R

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of currently produced tractors have a 4 K 4 drive. Despite this fact, when purchasing a new tractor utilized mainly for transport on paved surfaces or on the road, the question arises whether to invest less money and prefer a <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> a 4 K 2 drive. Differences in price of a new <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> front drive or only with driven axle can reach tens {{to hundreds of thousands}} of crowns, according to the selected type and model. This thesis may contribute to the correct decision when purchasing a new tractor by comparing the tensile properties of the same <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> 4 K 4 or 4 K 2 drive and offering a direct comparison of the difference of tensile properties of the tractor, which are highly dependent on traction and slippage of the drive wheels. It is at the discretion of each user whether to invest more funds into <b>tractors</b> <b>with</b> a 4 K 4 drive and take advantage of the tractor's maximum tensile properties or to save and buy a <b>tractor</b> <b>with</b> a 4 K 2 drive for a price of lower utility values...|$|R
