5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive {{about his relationship with}} the Communist Party than he had been in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E
5|$|George Herman Ruth Jr. {{was born}} in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the Pigtown section of Baltimore, Maryland. Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of German American ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His {{paternal}} grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included lightning rod salesman and streetcar operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. {{was born in}} the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and <b>trade</b> <b>unionist.</b> Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.|$|E

2500|$|A Marplan {{poll showed}} {{that half of the}} <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> {{questioned}} opposed unlawful action in defiance of the Act. Less than 50% of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> in a MORI poll supported the TUC campaign, and a Gallup poll found that over 50% of the public and <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> believed that leaders of trade union who broke the law should be sent to prison.|$|R
25|$|Judging by opinion polls, the Act had {{the support}} of the general public and <b>trade</b> <b>unionists.</b> A MORI poll in November 1981 {{revealed}} that 79% of the public and 77% of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> agreed that regular ballots should be held in existing closed shops; 70% of the public and 61% of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> agreed that a company should be allowed to sue a trade union if it lost money in dispute which was unconnected to the company; and 76% of the public and 70% of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> agreed that companies should be able to sue trade unions which broke agreements.|$|R
5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Seow Fang {{sees her}} classmate wearing her lost shoes to school. She and Kiat Kun follow the girl home, but after {{realising}} {{her father is}} blind and that her family was in a more dire situation than theirs, they decide not to reclaim the shoes. However, a few days later, Seow Fang notices that her classmate is wearing a new pair; upon confronting her, she discovers that the girl has discarded the old pair at the kampung rubbish dump. The Chew siblings frantically search the rubbish dump for her shoes, but only discover them as they are destroyed during a <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> riot against a policeman (Wakin Chau).|$|E
5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
2500|$|Until around 1990 Colombian {{trade unions}} {{were among the}} strongest in Latin America. However, the 1980s {{expansion}} of paramilitarism in Colombia saw trade union leaders and members increasingly targeted for assassination, {{and as a result}} Colombia has been the most dangerous country in the world for <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> for several decades. Between 2000 and 2010 Colombia accounted for 63.12% of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> murdered globally. According to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) there were 2832 murders of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> between 1 January 1986 and 30 April 2010, meaning that [...] "on average, men and women <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> in Colombia have been killed at the rate of one every three days over the last 23 years." ...|$|R
25|$|During the 1990s students, <b>trade</b> <b>unionists,</b> {{and workers}} often {{demonstrated}} {{to express their}} discontent with the government. Students protested in 1990 against proposals {{for an increase in}} government control of universities and again in 1991 and 1992 when they clashed with police. <b>Trade</b> <b>unionists</b> and workers also criticised the government during this time. In 1992 police prevented <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> from holding anti-government demonstrations. In 1994 widespread industrial unrest weakened the economy. In 1996 civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues.|$|R
5000|$|When reformers urged {{cooperation}} {{with women and}} Negroes in industry, <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> who were inclined to look upon both groups as cheap labor competition became incensed. During the postwar recession <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> accepted Greenbackism {{as a means of}} establishing cooperatives which would eliminate [...] "wage slavery" [...] and alleviate the [...] "miserable condition of workingmen." [...] After 1870, however, when labor began to share in business recovery, the same <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> found Greenbackism [...] "highly amusing," [...] a description which in turn angered the reformers.|$|R
5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca {{and becoming a}} <b>trade</b> <b>unionist,</b> he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca {{as part of the}} War on Drugs, denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by {{the mostly}} white {{minority}} government of Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from the United Kingdom in 1965, the southern African country entered {{a period of}} international isolation as an unrecognised state under Ian Smith. Black nationalist movements, backed by communist powers and themselves variously Marxist–Leninist, launched military campaigns to overthrow Rhodesia's government and bring majority rule to the country; the main nationalist groups were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), which was Chinese-backed, mostly Shona and influenced by Maoism, and the rival Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was largely Ndebele, more orthodoxly Marxist–Leninist {{and supported by the}} Warsaw Pact and associated nations, prominently Cuba. Each nationalist group fielded a guerrilla army—ZANU's was called the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), while ZAPU's was the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). ZAPU was led by Joshua Nkomo, a <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> from Bulawayo in Matabeleland, while ZANU was headed from 1975 by a former teacher from Mashonaland, Robert Mugabe.|$|E
5|$|The June 2000 {{parliamentary}} elections were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980. Sixteen parties took part, although the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)—led by <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> Morgan Tsvangirai—was particularly successful. During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed {{and in some}} cases killed. The Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, although not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU-PF supporters. Observers from the European Union (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair. The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC. For the first time, ZANU-PF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change. ZANU-PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.|$|E

5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, {{born out of}} a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported <b>trade</b> <b>unionist</b> candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP morphed into the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The National Labor School (ENS) {{reports that}} 38 <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> were murdered in Colombia between January 1 and December 1, 2007. While this does reflect a welcome {{decrease}} {{from the number}} of <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> murdered in 2006, the current rate of murders still places the country in a class of its own. Since 1991, 2, 283 Colombian <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> have been murdered. In the majority of cases where a motive for the murder can be identified, the unionist was murdered because of his or her trade union activity. The ENS also registered 201 death threats against <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> in the first eleven months of 2007. These threats, though not as sensational, severely chill trade union activity, particularly because so many of these threats have materialized in the past. The combination of ongoing assassinations, death threats and violence against family members creates a climate of fear for <b>trade</b> <b>unionists</b> that makes it impossible for them to fully and confidently exercise their rights to organize, bargain collectively, go on strike or criticize the government...|$|R
