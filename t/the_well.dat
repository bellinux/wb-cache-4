5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from <b>the</b> <b>well</b> will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in <b>the</b> <b>well</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>well</b> walls) rendering <b>the</b> <b>well</b> impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use <b>the</b> <b>well</b> for ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It has been said that the lower stone walls near <b>the</b> <b>well</b> were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would make it the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> In modern times, water from <b>the</b> <b>well</b> has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and blows up both <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

30|$|The {{delay in}} the oil {{production}} in off-set SAGD cases lasts significantly longer than that of conventional SAGD.

It is obvious that the vertical spacing between <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> also has a direct relationship with the communication establishment period. However, the later parameter’s effect is much less intense compared to that of horizontal distance.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} field began forming approximately 3,500,000 {{years ago}} and has grown steadily since then. The tectonic causes of the volcanism that have produced <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field are not yet clear and are therefore a matter of ongoing research. It is approximately [...] inland from the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is along-strike from the Nootka Fault on the British Columbia Coast, which has been subducting under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. <b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray volcanics are mostly alkali olivine basalt, with some lava flows comprising mantle xenoliths. Basalts of <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field have been considered to be the easternmost expression of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. However, its relationship is unknown because the age-location trend does not reach into <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater area, and <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is not along trend with the Anahim Volcanic Belt. <b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray volcanics were thought to have formed by crustal thinning and the existence of crustal penetrating structures.|$|R
