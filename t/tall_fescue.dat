While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as <b>tall</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the <b>tall</b> <b>fescue</b> endophyte, N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E

40|$|Feeding on above- and belowground plant tissues by Tipula paludosa Meigen {{during the}} period of rapid growth from second to forth instars is highly {{damaging}} to cool-season (C 3) turfgrasses. It may be possible to reduce this damage by identifying grass genotypes that increase host plant protection. This study examined the impacts of plant genotype, endophyte infection, and plant ontogeny on host plant and insect responses during whole-plant feeding by T. paludosa. A series of no-choice greenhouse trials were conducted with third instar crane flies to determine 1) host plant tolerance in terms of reductions to above- and belowground plant biomass, 2) antixenosis resistance impacting insect behavior (emigration), and 3) antibiosis resistance impacting insect growth. Results showed that insect infestation level was the primary factor influencing plant biomass reductions. Belowground tissues were more tolerant to feeding than were aboveground tissues, with <b>tall</b> <b>fescues,</b> Festuca arundinacea Schreber, being most resistant to aboveground biomass reduction. Host plant associations with intercellular fungal endophytes (E+) decreased insect weight gain and decreased insect movement, but did not increase host plant tolerance. Plant ontogeny affected this response with insect weight gain significantly decreased on young (28 d) growth E+ grasses but not on old (90 d) growth E+ grasses, however. Host plant genotype and plant ontogeny can have significant impacts to host plant tolerance and insect physiology for T. paludosa larva. Furthermore, plant-endophyte associations have apparent sublethal effects that impact insect fitness and may further enhance host plant protectio...|$|R
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in <b>tall</b> <b>fescue,</b> where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{within the}} European Union several legislative, {{monitoring}} and coordinating actions have been undertaken to encourage sustainable use of resources, {{reduction in the}} use of chemicals and improvement of the urban environment. In this respect, two concepts that are strictly related to most of the aspects above are: ‘‘precision agriculture’’ and ‘‘precision conservation’’ and more specifically ‘‘precision turfgrass management. ’’ Optical sensing has become a crucial part of precision turfgrass management and spectral reflectance in particular has been an active area of research for many years. However, while turfgrass status evaluation by proximity-sensed spectral reflectance appears to be an established and reliable practice, much more could be achieved in terms of monitoring of large turfgrass areas through remote sensing, and in particular through satellite imagery. This paper reports the results of a trial attempting to evaluate the spectral signatures of several turfgrass species and cultivars, for future use in turfgrass satellite monitoring. Our experimental study focused on 20 turfgrass species/varieties including perennial ryegrasses, <b>tall</b> <b>fescues,</b> kentucky bluegrasses, bermudagrass ecotypes, seeded commercial bermudagrasses, vegetatively propagated bermudagrasses, Zoysia japonica and non-japonica zoysiagrasses.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} soil erosion by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE 2) {{is critical for}} several conservation assessments, {{least of which is}} its use in the Phosphorus Index (PI) to identify and rank the vulnerability of agricultural fields to phosphorus (P) runoff. Earlier versions of RUSLE reported a soil loss overestimation, which were revised to give RUSLE 2, where biomass production in different climatic regions was more accurately represented. RUSLE version 2. 0, which contains the new vegetative biomass production routine, was evaluated using two performance indices, the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (NSE) and Index of Agreement (D) across 27 cattle grazed fields in Southeastern U. S. An overall NSE of - 0. 164 and D of 0. 242, indicated RUSLE 2 poorly predicts soil loss for this region. Further investigation was needed to understand the reason for these poor soil loss estimates by RUSLE 2. RUSLE 2 estimates of soil loss are based on Hortion overflow sediment delivery from daily storm events accrued to an annual soil loss along a given field slope. Compared with measured sediment delivery from seven <b>tall</b> <b>fescues</b> (Festuca arundinacea) fields in northwest Arkansas over five years, with various manure and grazing management, sediment delivery estimated by RUSLE 2 was acceptable, with log NSE (1. 4). However, RUSLE 2 over-predicted the number of storm events between 2009 - 2013 for all seven fields, from field collected rainfall- intensity data which created the localized 5 - years erosivity values. Over-prediction on the number of storm events would lead to an increase in annual soil loss estimate. A need for a lower restrictive rainfall threshold value that does not initiate field runoff, and in turn, sediment delivery, particularly in grassland system, needs to be incorporated into RUSLE 2 soil loss estimates...|$|R

2500|$|President Theodore Roosevelt, who {{had engaged}} the {{architectural}} firm of McKim, Mead, and White to reconfigure and rebuild {{part of the}} White House in 1902, was induced to simplify the grounds, removing what was increasingly seen as Victorian clutter. The bedding scheme on the North Lawn was greatly simplified. Later, in 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt engaged Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. to evaluate the grounds and recommend changes. Olmsted understood the need to offer presidents and their families a modicum of privacy balancing with the requirement for public views of the White House. The Olmsted plan presented the landscape largely as seen today: retaining or planting large specimen trees and shrubs on the perimeter to create boundaries for visual privacy, but opened with generous sight lines of the house from north and south.

2500|$|Lolines are {{produced}} by several grass–endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenoids, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines {{are produced}} at levels, however, that can exceed 10mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2–20,000µg/g), exceeding the concentrations of the other endophyte alkaloids by >1000-fold. Lolines produced in the grasses Lolium pratense (syn. Festuca pratensis, meadow fescue) and <b>tall</b> <b>fescue</b> infected by [...] N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum (see Fig. 3), respectively, exhibit variable concentrations in grass tissues. Higher loline concentrations (100–1000µg/g) {{are present in the}} seeds and in younger leaf tissues, and the lolines display seasonal changes in concentration levels throughout the plant. The periodical appearance of tissues with high loline concentrations, such as flowering stems and seeds, contributes to this seasonal variation. Loline concentrations often increase in grass tissues regrown after defoliation and clipping of plants, suggesting an inducible defense response mechanism, involving both symbiotic partners. However, this increase appears to be due to higher loline levels in younger leaves compared to older leaves, but loline increases resembling inducible plant defenses have also been reported. Variation of loline concentration with the developmental stage of specific grass tissues suggests regulation of in planta loline distributions, providing greater protection of newly grown or embryonic tissues against attacks by insects. Surprisingly, exogenous application of the plant signaling compound, methyl jasmonate—which commonly signals predation by insects—decreases expression of the genes for the lolines. The factors that control loline production vary also among endophyte-infected grass tissues: whereas plant-supplied amino acids that are loline precursors limit accumulation of lolines in many grass tissues, their production in tissues that bear external mycelial growth for fungal reproduction (stromata) is regulated by the expression of loline genes.|$|E
40|$|Biorational {{alternatives}} are gaining increased attention for weed conlrol {{because of concerns}} related to pesticide usage and dwindling numbers of labeled products, particularly for minor-use crops. AIlelo-pathy offers potential for biorational weed control through the produc-tion and release of allelochemlcs from leaves, flowers, seeds, stems, and roots of living or decomposing plant materials. Under appropriate conditions, alldochemics may be released in quantities suppressive to developing weed seedlings. Allelochemics often exhibit selectivity, similar to synthetic herbicides.
