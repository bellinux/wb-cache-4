40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} <b>the</b> pricing <b>of</b> exotic options when <b>the</b> price dynamic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying risky asset {{is governed by}} a discrete-time Markov-modulated process driven by a Higher-order Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). We assume that the market interest rate, the drift and <b>the</b> volatility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying risky asset’s return switch over time according to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HHMM. Here <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HHMM are interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> an economy. <b>The</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HHMM {{is that it can}} capture <b>the</b> long-range dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. We will then employ the well-known tool in actuarial science, namely, the Esscher transform to determine an equivalent martingale measure for option valuation.

5|$|The Port Phillip {{team were}} favourites {{before the game}} began.

Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E

5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending on <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E
