500|$|Rifenburg was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in September 2007. [...] He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for [...] "those who did it first, {{the people who had}} no pattern to follow." [...] The Hall of Fame award was presented to Rifenburg's wife, Jane. In her acceptance speech, Jane Rifenburg observed that despite all of her late husband's achievements, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he had never received: [...] "He had a great career, but he never had a trophy. And now he has." ...|$|E
2500|$|As war {{correspondent}} Ernie Pyle, who {{was later}} killed in action, would write, [...] "Major General Terry Allen {{was one of}} my favorite people. Partly because he didn't give a damn for hell or high water; partly because he was more colorful than most; and partly because he was the only general outside the Air Forces I could call by his first name. If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the world Allen lived and breathed for, it was to fight. He had been all shot up in the last war, and he seemed not the least averse to getting shot up again. This was no intellectual war with him. He hated Germans and Italians like vermin." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} misconceptions about Lokhvitskaya, according to Vengerov {{who refused to}} see in her a 'decadent' poet. [...] "Totally devoid of sickly feebleness and vain extravagance" [...] (generally associated with the Russian decadent movement), she was, [...] "eager to enjoy life, declaring her right to put forth her feelings with all the mighty fullness of her soul," [...] he maintained. In fact, [...] "the poetess's agility was very much akin {{to the challenges of}} Marxism," [...] opined the critic (a Marxist himself), while her [...] "views on the meaning and reason of life belonged to the Oriental tradition," [...] even if [...] "channeled through a narrow love theme." [...] If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in Lokhvitskaya's poetry that riled most of her contemporaries, that was her almost demonstrative lack of social awareness.|$|E

5000|$|If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that really}} honks me off, it's the {{hopelessness}} and futility {{of the human}} condition ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care about}} the reward,' said the old woman, 'but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I should like. You must know that I am very {{particular}} about what I eat, and if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I fancy above all others, it is a plump, tender little mouse. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> such a thing in your garret just throw it down to me, and in return I will promise that your little daughter shall be well taken care of.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E

60|$|If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that Mumps liked, it was root beer, {{while he}} knew candied fruit was very rich eating. Accordingly he hesitated.|$|E
