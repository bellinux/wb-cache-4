Retitled [...] "I Remember Lemuria!"; it was published in the March 1945 issue of Amazing. The issue sold out, and generated quite a response: between 1945 and 1949, many letters arrived attesting to the truth of Shaver's claims (tens of thousands of letters, according to Palmer). The correspondents claimed that they, too, had heard strange voices or encountered denizens of the Hollow Earth. One of the letters to Amazing Stories was from a woman who claimed to have gone into a deep subbasement of a Paris, France building via a secret elevator. After months of rape and other torture, the woman was freed by a benevolent Tero. Another letter claiming involvement with Deros came from Fred Crisman, later to gain notoriety {{for his role in the}} Maury Island Incident and the John F. Kennedy Assassination.

40|$|Language {{development}} in multiples, especially twins {{is a topic}} of much discussion and controversy. Twins are often stigmatized {{when it comes to}} language acquisition and are often thought of as ‘at risk’ for language development by the general population. However, there is no consensus on how delayed twins are in comparison to singletons; the varying methodology and sample sizes make it almost impossible to come to an agreement. This research focuses on the development of narrative within the development of language in the triplet population. A set of bilingual triplets was administered the Frog Story in two languages: Russian and English. The preliminary results regarding <b>word</b> <b>counts,</b> code switching, mean length of utterance and <b>total</b> <b>word</b> <b>counts</b> are presented in this paper. Two children were found not to be delayed in both languages; one was only delayed in English, in terms of MLU. The code switching results were unique to each child as were the type-token counts.

There were 13 second language learners {{in the group of}} 20 students who participated in the study. Participants were placed into three heterogeneous groups and rotated between typing in a blog and handwriting in a journal during 25 -minute writing sessions. Students typed five entries in a blog and handwrote five entries in a journal over a six-week period. They responded to each other in both writing formats. All entries were assessed for content, organization, grammar, and spelling using a rubric. <b>Total</b> <b>word</b> <b>counts</b> for blogs and journal entries were noted, and teacher observation notes were analyzed. The results of this study showed that students wrote more words in their handwritten journals than they typed in the blog, but <b>total</b> <b>words</b> increased over time in both formats. The students had no significant improvement in their rubric scores during the period of the study. It was observed that students were engaged and on task throughout the study, but had minimal keyboarding skills and were less efficient at typing than handwriting.

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{auditory}} subliminal message upon {{the performance of}} a writing task and upon the mood of the participants was investigated in this study. One hundred and twenty-eight subjects (randomly assigned to eight conditions, each one comprising 16 subjects) were asked to create a children's story. One condition was exposed to a happy subliminal message (the word happy repeated every five seconds, 14 dB below ambient noise), one condition to a sad subliminal message, and another condition to a subliminal white noise tape. These three conditions received the message while writing the story. Three additional conditions (incubation) were exposed to the same tapes for twenty minutes before writing the story. In addition, there were two contrast conditions in which subjects were requested to write a happy (sad) children's story without being exposed to a subliminal message. The main dependent measures were: self-ratings of the subjects' mood on the axis of pleasure; judges' ratings of the happiness/sadness of the stories; and happy, sad, happy-related, sad-related, and <b>total</b> <b>word</b> <b>counts.</b> With regards to the task, the results indicated no effects for the no incubation conditions; {{a significant difference between the}} happy and sad conditions among the incubation conditions; and a significant difference between the two upon request conditions. With regards to the mood of the participants, there was a decrease in pleasure for the sad no incubation condition and a similar decrease for the happy incubation condition. The main conclusions drawn from the present experiment are: mood and task are affected in an independent fashion by the subliminal messages; the affective tone of the stories did not in turn affect the mood of the subjects in the subliminal conditions; the request to write a happy or a sad story did not give rise to mood change as observed with other supraliminal mood-induction techniques; and it appears that subliminal effects are different from supraliminal effects...|$|R

5000|$|Giving an {{accurate}} estimate for the <b>total</b> <b>word</b> <b>count</b> is difficult, {{since it is}} hard to define what to call [...] "a word" [...] in agglutinating languages, due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words. The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words. (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words, with an average intellectual using 25-30 thousand words.) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze English {{vocabulary}} usage in online Lao recipes from a cooking website. The aim of this study is to analyze frequency of eight categories of parts of speech; noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction and determiner. This study is a survey research. The data collection is from 21 Lao recipes selected for analysis. The researcher maintained the use of data analysis by apparently using the frequency and percentage of various types of part of speech as a tool to use for teaching English language most effectively. According to the aims consisting of types of parts of speech divided into eight categories from an online Lao food recipe site entitled: “Lao recipe from a cooking website” was used for summa -rizing the usage frequency of parts of speech from 21 Lao recipes. In the final conclusion, that was taken from the result it was found that “Noun” is the highest frequency part of speech that was frequently used in recipe writing with a <b>count</b> of 1390 <b>words</b> that is a frequency percentage of 42. 78 %. That is twice the usage frequency of verb which is ranked second amongst the eight parts of speech.

50|$|The {{branching}} path stories {{found in}} visual novels represent an {{evolution of the}} Choose Your Own Adventure concept. The digital medium allows for significant improvements, such as being able to fully explore multiple aspects and perspectives of a story. Another improvement is having hidden decision points that are automatically determined based on the player's past decisions. In Fate/stay night, for example, the way the player character behaved towards non-player characters {{during the course of}} the game affects the way they react to the player character in later scenes, such as whether or not they choose to help in life-or-death situations. This would be far more difficult to track with physical books. More importantly, visual novels do not face the same length restrictions as a physical book. For example, the <b>total</b> <b>word</b> <b>count</b> of the English fan translation of Fate/stay night, taking all the branching paths into account, exceeds that of The Lord of the Rings. This significant increase in length allows visual novels to tell stories as long and complex as those often found in traditional novels, while still maintaining a branching path structure, and allowing them to focus on complex stories with mature themes and consistent plots in a way which Choose Your Own Adventure books were unable to do due to their physical limitations. Visual novels with non-branching plots, such as Higurashi When They Cry, Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, Muv-Luv Alternative, and Digital: A Love Story are rare exceptions within the genre.|$|E
