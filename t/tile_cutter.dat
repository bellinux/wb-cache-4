5000|$|... #Caption: Seen here is {{a ceramic}} <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> {{that has been used}} to cut bottles (seen {{on the ground in the}} image) to be taped {{together}} into a bottle wall ...|$|E
50|$|The ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> {{works by}} first {{scratching}} {{a straight line}} {{across the surface of}} the tile with a hardened metal wheel and then applying pressure directly below the line and on each side of the line on top. Snapping pressure varies widely, some mass-produced models exerting over 750 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> was {{designed}} to facilitate the work and solve the problems that masons had when cutting hydraulic mosaic or encaustic cement tiles (a type of decorative tile with pigmented cement, highly used in 50s, due to the high strength needed {{because of the high}} hardness and thickness of these tiles).|$|E
50|$|Ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>cutters</b> {{are used}} to cut tiles to a {{required}} size or shape. They come {{in a number of}} different forms, from basic manual devices to complex attachments for power tools.|$|R
5000|$|For tile that {{requires}} a straight cut a <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> is used. This is a small mechanical device where the tile is placed, aligned and clamped on a platform; lightly [...] "scored" [...] with a cutting wheel and snapped in two with a handled slicer (blade similar to a paper cutter in appearance).For larger jobs an electric tile saw or wet saw is used; this saw {{is similar to a}} small mitre saw except that water is distributed on the saw blade to lessen the effects of heat and friction.|$|E
50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: Tiling - The contestants must lay tile {{on their}} tub decks. Neither Charlene nor Ajay {{are ready for}} tiles as their tub decks are not fully {{installed}} (and their tiles, and Dan's also, will be installed without waterproofing due to Matt having used up all their waterproofing in the last episode), so the experts assist in completing their decks so as {{to level the playing}} field. As for the challenge itself, after a brief one-line lesson from Geoff on how to use tile adhesive (to read the instructions that come with the adhesive), and a longer lesson from Gail on how to tile, the challenge begins in earnest. Charlene had chosen difficult glass tiles which require more finesse, while Matt and Rob use larger tiles; Dan's and Ajay's tiles are ceramic tiles of medium size. Dan manages to use his tile spacers incorrectly, but he tiles his entire tub before realizing his error; he runs out of time and fails before he can dig out the spacers. Matt manages to pass after several initial troubles with cutting tiles upside-down. Rob injures himself repeatedly, and has only two courses of tiles before he runs out of time and fails. Ajay also fails due to taking too long and installing his tiles in an asymmetrical manner, contrary to Gail's directive; he also manages to short out the light fitting in his room after failing to fit the water guard on his <b>tile</b> <b>cutter,</b> which consequently squirts a large jet of water onto the light. The difficulty of Charlene's work causes her to run out of time and fail, though most of the tiles which do not require cutting are up.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Circular cutters with uniform radial cracks are {{extensively}} used in {{the cutting}} processes. Unwanted noise, vibration & accidental failure associated with the cutting process have become an important economic and technological problem in the industry. The knowledge of natural frequencies of components is of great interest {{in the study of}} response of structures to various excitations. Hence, it is important to study a circular <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> with central hole, which fixed at inner edge and free at outer edge with its dynamic response. In this study some efforts are taken for analyzing vibration characteristics of <b>tile</b> <b>cutter</b> used in tile cutting industries with free boundary condition but having different (enlargement of stress concentration holes, slot end hole diameter,numbers of cutting teethâ€™s, aspect ratio, effect of number and length of cracks, variable radial slit, circular concentric slit, thickness). Results From the FEA and FFT it is found that, this study is needful for design data preparation to avoid resonance and vibration in tile cutting industries from which finding out natural frequency and vibration w. r. t. different changes in <b>tile</b> <b>cutter.</b> Thus Theoretical, ANSYS & FFT results obtained are to be compared...|$|E
