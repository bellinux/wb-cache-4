25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{able to do it}} in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the album's release, musicians {{who had worked with}} Idol in the past were asked to comment on the failure of Cyberpunk. Tony James of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, a pop-cyberpunk band, and former bassist for Generation X, weighed in. Though sympathetic to his former band mate, he felt the stylistic change didn't fit Idol. [...] "Billy is always cool but he does Billy Idol rebel yellin the best, i felt cyberpunk was a wrong turning for him..he has his sound..stay great as u are Bill..." [...] In 2001 Steve Stevens was asked if Idol's declining popularity and the failure of Cyberpunk was related to their split. Stevens rejected the idea, saying of the failed album, [...] "I think the Cyberpunk record people didn't get. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> doing Billy and his fans a great disservice if I said that he needed me for his popularity." ...|$|E

Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label. I'm really happy that they want me to do another album so soon – I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I'm just excited to get under way with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failed}} surrogacy, Susan decides to enroll on a media course at Eden Hills University. In June 2010, she begins {{receiving}} threats via text messages and emails, {{telling her to}} stay away from the university. She is later followed by an unseen person in a car. Susan later spots the car outside her house and she is very frightened. The cyber bully brings up some of Susan's personal issues within their threats and this make her feel vulnerable. They also make places that Susan has previously felt safe in, feel unsafe. Of this Woodburne said [...] "To feel so vulnerable in your own neighbourhood would be just awful. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equally frightened". As Susan suffers from multiple sclerosis, the stress has a big impact upon her health. Woodburne said that Susan is usually a very strong person mentally, but she feels out of control because the situation is distressing her. She becomes a victim. Susan tries to stand up to the bully and refuses {{to stay away from}} the university. However, when she arrives for her lesson, she receives another threatening message. This terrifies her and she locks herself in the toilets.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara {{was offered}} roles in The Razor's Edge (1946), which went to Tierney, John Wayne's film Tycoon (1947), which went to Laraine Day, and Bob Hope's The Paleface, which went to Jane Russell. She {{turned down the}} role in The Paleface as she {{was going through a}} {{turbulent}} period in her personal life and [...] "didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to laugh every day and have fun". She later deeply regretted turning it down and confessed that she'd made a [...] "terrible mistake". In 1947, O'Hara starred opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Shireen in the adventure film Sinbad the Sailor. O'Hara plays a glamorous adventuress who assists Sinbad (Fairbanks) locate the hidden treasure of Alexander the Great. She found the scenario to be [...] "ridiculous", but stated that it made a [...] "pot of money for RKO– action-adventures almost always did". Malone wrote: [...] "O'Hara looks splendid and gets to wear some of the most stunning costumes of her career—a different one in almost every scene—but her dialogue is floridly empty. She exudes potential in early scenes, where her air of sybaritic slyness seems promise she'll be something more than window dressing", but thought the film [...] "totally lacked drama". The critic from The New York Times thought that O'Hara excessive costume changes made watching her an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience".|$|E

500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E
2500|$|Both Hansard and Irglova {{give the}} {{impression}} in interviews that {{they are unlikely to}} pursue further acting. Irglova has spoken about being nervous in front of a crew, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good actress, overall", and Hansard generally refers to the movie as a one-off, talking of [...] "moving on... living a different life".|$|E

During pre-race car {{inspections}} NASCAR had an issue with the rear-end housing being outside of its allowable tolerances. Jamie Little, walking with Busch, asked if he was okay with her asking a question. Busch responded, [...] "Why the fuck do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> okay, I gotta go get in my car. NASCAR told me I gotta get in my car".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it.

2500|$|When Ledger and Gyllenhaal {{were asked}} about any fear of being cast in such {{controversial}} roles, Ledger responded {{that he was not}} afraid of the role, but rather he was concerned {{that he would not be}} mature enough as an actor to do the story justice. Gyllenhaal has stated that he is extremely proud of the film and his role, regardless of what the reactions would be. He regards rumors of him being bisexual as flattering, stating: [...] "I'm open to whatever people want to call me. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> afraid of it if it happened." [...] Both have stated that the sex scenes in the beginning were difficult to do. Lee found the first scene difficult to film and has stated he has great respect for the two main actors for their [...] "courage". Ledger's performance was described by Luke Davies as a difficult and empowering portrayal given the environment of the film: [...] "In Brokeback Mountain the vulnerability, the potential for danger, is so great – a world so masculine it might destroy you for any aberration – that [...] real brilliance was to bring to the screen a character, Ennis Del Mar, so fundamentally shut down that he is like a bible of unrequited desires, stifled yearnings, lost potential." ...|$|E
