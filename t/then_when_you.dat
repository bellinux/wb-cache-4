5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} book, Melanie C further elaborated: [...] "'Mama's {{all about how}} you're such a cow to your mum when you're going through that rebellious teenage stage. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get a bit older, you realise that {{whatever}} she was doing, she was only doing it for your own good. And you think: 'God, I was really horrible.'" [...] "Mama" [...] was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] in March 1997, timed {{not only for the}} Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.|$|E
500|$|On July 8, he {{was seriously}} wounded by mortar fire, having just {{returned}} from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for {{the men at the}} front line. Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: [...] "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you... <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you." [...] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan. He spent six months at the hospital, where he met and formed a strong friendship with [...] "Chink" [...] Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future American foreign service officer, ambassador, and author Henry Serrano Villard.|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} the [...] "menacing rhythm and chanted vocals" [...] on [...] "Diva", mark the album's biggest departure. Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times felt that the song was {{influenced}} by Beyoncé's husband, American rapper Jay-Z as it has a [...] "bad soft-core gangster rap". He also noted that its contains words that could get an [...] "explicit" [...] sticker by the chain stores. Similarly, Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix remarked that the song is [...] "particularly intriguing" [...] as it progresses through [...] "hard-knockish robbery scenarios" [...] which does not resemble Beyoncé's clean public image. Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine noted that [...] "Diva" [...] places a [...] "startling, sexy snarl over window-rattling bass". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted Beyoncé turns out [...] "modal-sounding hooks" [...] over 808 bass on the song. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described Sasha Fierce as [...] "suffer no such identity crisis, brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty...", reflected on [...] "Diva". James Reed of The Boston Globe described [...] "Diva" [...] as a [...] "glitchy, bass-heavy thumper with the most ridiculous chorus of the year". Reed nevertheless added that the song is [...] "insanely catchy, but <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hear something looped incessantly, no matter how mindless, it's bound to stick".|$|E
500|$|Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law {{enforcement}} authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, {{he was assigned to}} the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived there on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: [...] "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go to jump school... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting." [...] In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: [...] "I really need it now." [...] His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words [...] "Betty Jean" [...] to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "23", {{is heavily}} {{inspired}} by her boyfriend Gerard Piqué, is a melodic pop rock song with lyrics as; [...] "Hey, {{do you believe}} in destiny? 'Cause I do as I did <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were only 23." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All right, sir," [...] said Baldwin, {{returning}} the letter {{without looking at}} it; [...] "I'll take your word for it, sir, as it's not much in my line {{to make out the}} meanin' o' pot-hooks and hangers.--Now, <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> will <b>you</b> have your first lesson?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Michael {{was arrested}} by {{undercover}} policeman Marcelo Rodríguez, in a sting operation using so-called [...] "pretty police". In an MTV interview, Michael stated: [...] "I got followed into the restroom and then this cop—I didn't {{know it was a}} cop, obviously—he started playing this game, which I think is called, 'I'll show you mine, you show me yours, and <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> show me yours, I'm going to nick [...] you!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nilsson's autobiography, Mina minnesbilder (My memoirs in pictures) was {{published}} in Stockholm in 1977. She retired in 1984 to her childhood home in the Skåne province of southern Sweden, where {{her father had been}} a sixth-generation farmer and she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. In an interview in the mid-1990s, she appeared happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. [...] "I've always tried to remember what my mother used to tell me", she said. [...] "Stay close to the earth. <b>Then</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fall down, it won't hurt so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is no mystery, my dear madam," [...] said he, smiling. [...] "The {{left arm}} of your jacket is spattered with mud in {{no less than}} seven places.
