Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E

Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, Elsa Triolet, Eugène Guillevic, Raymond Queneau, Francis Ponge, Jacques Prévert and painter Pablo Picasso.|$|E
50|$|In studies {{there was}} a {{positive}} correlation between Machiavellianism and workplace bullying. Machiavellianism predicted involvement in bullying others. The groups of bullies and bully-victims had a higher Machiavellianism level compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> groups of victims and persons non-involved in bullying. The results showed that being bullied was negatively related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of clan and adhocracy cultures and positively related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of hierarchy culture.|$|R

5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{known as}} the Alumnae Gymnasium, the {{building}} was erected as a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that Vassar's physical education program was falling behind those of other Seven Sisters colleges. Plans for the hall were made, scrapped, and remade as the college and alumnae benefactors struggled to raise sufficient funds. Ultimately, the building was designed by William Tubby and constructed in 1889, signaling a physical decentralization away from the college's Main Building. When it opened, the gymnasium featured a large pool {{and a variety of}} other athletic spaces. Vassar's enrollment quickly outgrew the limited space within the building, and it was first expanded and then superseded by Kenyon Hall in the 1930s. The Geology Department moved into the building shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The large, mostly {{spontaneous}} gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop {{events were}} an important {{sign of a}} change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error may have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the working}} environment, {{the attitudes and}} {{behaviours}} individuals display toward change are a fundamental part of whether change initiatives succeed or fail. In a growing world of computer-mediated communication, social networking sites are being incorporated into <b>the</b> corporate arena <b>to</b> better communication and functionality. Yet it still remains as a change initiative. This research report looked at whether readiness for organisational change, resistance toward organisational change and behavioural support for organisational change related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> and usage of a corporate SNS. Similarly demographic characteristics were also explored. Correlations, ANOVAs, a Chi squared, a Multiple Linear Regression and a Moderated Multiple Regression were conducted. The sample consisted of 118 participants of which, 65 % were female, 59 % were white, 49 % were married and the 69 % were under 49 years of age. The researcher found that readiness and behavioural support for organisational change related positively <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of <b>the</b> SNS whereas resistance to organisational change did not. Race significantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of <b>the</b> SNS and SNS usage significantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SNS uptake data categories.

5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Yagnavalkya {{explains}} that warm air inhaled passes to the Brahmarandhra via the navel which helps in curing diseases.

When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman (Atman), which is the heart, according to verses 12.15–22, the fire located {{in the region of}} Susumna, which is between the eyebrows glows. These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire-like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta (mind).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E

5|$|Several {{universities}} on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, {{replaced the}} sport with rugby. At the time, {{the future of}} football {{was very much in}} doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive {{for the purposes of}} recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

This study set out to examine factors influencing employees’ organisational justice perceptions in a South African government department. <b>The</b> <b>perceptions</b> of <b>the</b> 289 participants were investigated by using the Organisational Justice Measurement Instrument (OJMI) {{as a measure of}} organisational justice. Descriptive statistics of the sample and factor analysis were conducted <b>to</b> analyse <b>the</b> data and <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> factors that contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of organisational justice of government employees.
