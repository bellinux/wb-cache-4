5|$|In summer 727, another {{large-scale}} invasion {{was led by}} Mu'awiya, with Abdallah al-Battal heading <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the army. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor {{claims that}} <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> alone numbered 15,000 men and the entire invasion force 100,000, clearly a grossly inflated number. Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu'awiya's second-in-command, but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard. The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor, and <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> under al-Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a place called in Arab sources Tabya, possibly the fort of Ateous in Phrygia. Gangra was razed to the ground, but during the attack on Tabya the Arabs, especially the Antiochene contingent, {{are said to have}} suffered heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|Women {{of color}} usually {{operated}} separately. Juanita Craft (1902–85) {{was a leader}} {{in the civil rights movement}} through the Dallas NAACP. She focused on working with black youths, organizing them as <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of protests against segregationist practices in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. <b>The</b> <b>vanguard</b> fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of Alsace and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had been reluctant at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from Alsace. This reduced Roman forces in Alsace by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but it seems unlikely that the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E

5|$|Once Edward had {{regained the}} support of Clarence, he mounted a swift and decisive {{campaign}} to regain the Crown through combat; {{it is believed that}} Richard was his principal lieutenant as some of the king's earliest support came from members of Richard's affinity, including Sir James Harrington and Sir William Parr, who brought 600 men-at-arms to them at Doncaster. He may have led <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> at the Battle of Barnet, in his first command, on 14 April 1471, where he outflanked the Duke of Exeter's wing, although the degree to which his command was fundamental may have been exaggerated. That his personal household sustained losses indicates he was {{in the thick of the}} fighting. A contemporary source is clear about his holding <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> for Edward at Tewkesbury, deployed against the Lancastrian vanguard under the Duke of Somerset on 4 May 1471, and his role two days later, as Constable of England, sitting alongside John Howard as Earl Marshal, in the trial and sentencing of leading Lancastrians captured after the battle.|$|E

5|$|The British advance resumed at 05:30, and {{at about}} 08:30 <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the west end}} of Villers-Bocage. A {{squadron}} of the 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), moved through the town and occupied Point 213, an area of high ground to the east on the Caen road. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the {{breakout}} began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the retreating column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the breakout, the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

In 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell, who had previously commanded at company-level in Greece and the Middle East, the battalion was attached to the 5th Division and on 4 November the 14th/32nd Battalion, forming <b>the</b> <b>vanguard</b> of the 6th Brigade, carried out an amphibious landing at Jacquinot Bay on New Britain.|$|E

When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute.
