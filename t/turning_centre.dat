30|$|Auxiliary attachments—These are the {{additional}} attachments provided with CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> {{to enhance their}} overall machining performance. For example, guards are added to increase operator safety, automatic tool and job changers are often provided to reduce human interference and total machining time, and turret may be equipped with multiple tool holders so that a range of different machining operations can be performed simultaneously.|$|R
30|$|Power requirement—It {{deals with}} the power rating of a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre,</b> i.e. amount of power {{required}} to operate it. It is always beneficial to have machines which consume less power.|$|E
30|$|Maximum {{diameter}} (mm)—It {{is related}} to the maximum diameter of a workpiece that can be machined on a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre.</b> Like maximum length, it is also related to the capacity of the machine.|$|E
30|$|The interrelationship {{matrices}} for {{flexible and}} mass production plans are slightly {{different from each}} other. For example, presence of auxiliary attachments in a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> makes it more flexible. This affects the overall cost of the machine more strongly in flexible production than mass production. In flexible production plan, the correlation indices between flexibility and all other technical requirements are high due to greater impact of these requirements on flexibility. Moreover, a large volume of finished products is required in mass production and hence, {{if the number of}} tools is more in a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre,</b> its productivity will also be high. Therefore, there exists a stronger relationship between productivity and number of tools in mass production than flexible production. Similarly, the capacity of a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> for mass production should be such that it can accommodate more number of tools so that several machining operations can be performed simultaneously. Hence, capacity of the machine and number of tools are more strongly related in mass production than flexible production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{parameters}} {{impacting vehicle}} kinematics of turn – a time period needed for turning a steering wheel, {{a ratio of}} vehicle crosbases and wheelbases were analysed. By using a model, the entering of turns by vehicles and semitrailers was researched. The momentary <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> for vehicles and semitrailers diverged, depending on the researched turning radiuses. All vehicles with semitrailers, when turning, move along a circle after a 90 ° turn is performed. Articulated vehicles are an exception – their movement along a circle is possible only at large turning radiuses. It {{can be explained by}} the fact that semitrailers have large wheelbases...|$|R
