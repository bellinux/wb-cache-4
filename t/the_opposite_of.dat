5|$|The word Ahimsa—sometimes spelled as Ahinsa—is {{derived from}} the Sanskrit root hiṃs – to strike; hiṃsā is injury or harm, a-hiṃsā is <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> this, i.e. non harming or nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} is <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation {{tends to be}} weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E

5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, and {{intended}} to represent <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the protagonists' morals and values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, retroviruses and reverse {{transcriptase}} were discovered, showing {{for the first}} time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (<b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E

5000|$|Evils or vices (kakia), <b>the</b> <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> virtues. These {{have been}} {{discussed}} already in Book II because, like the virtues, vices are stable dispositions (hexeis), [...] "knowingly and deliberately chosen" [...] (Sachs p. 119).|$|R
5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Swift, the Drapier unites {{all of the}} various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> {{convergence}} is divergent evolution, where {{related species}} evolve different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution occurs when two independent but similar species evolve {{in the same direction}} and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> his heroines: his male characters {{are not particularly}} handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5000|$|As Aristotle noted, {{however, the}} virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be {{considered}} the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates in medio stat virtus - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; <b>the</b> <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more [...] "modern" [...] virtue, tolerance, {{can be considered}} the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness {{on the one hand}} and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as <b>the</b> <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.|$|R

5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} in some ways <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Connecticut's: while UConn dominated {{on the ground and}} barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9yards.|$|E
5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and {{may be involved in}} the regulation of transcription.|$|E

5|$|In 1836 {{the hotel}} was changed into a private lodging house and an extra storey of {{bedrooms}} added. The two watchman's boxes outside the museum were added around 1840. From 1853 until 1880 the building was let to the Bath Proprietary College. In 1891 the original 99-year lease of Sydney Gardens expired and its financial affairs had to be wound up. The Hotel and gardens were then sold, with plans published {{for the construction of}} a five-storey hotel to be built on the site. These plans were abandoned when the Empire Hotel was built on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the River Avon instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948 Pei was {{recruited}} by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> his own; his new boss {{was known for his}} loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
