5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution at the behest of <b>the</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Right.</b> Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

25|$|By the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan as {{president}} and the growing involvement of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> in conservative politics, Goldwater's libertarian views on personal issues were revealed; he {{believed that they were}} an integral part of true conservatism.

25|$|The movie 416 {{is named}} after Initiative 416, Nebraska's {{referendum}} banning same-sex marriage. Fields takes a balanced approach to the issue as he plays the initiative's backers against Nebraskans who oppose the measure, which passed with support from 71% of Nebraska voters. 416 purported to give an objective view of the issue but most reviewers suggested the film was highly critical of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

Berlet criticized Ralph Nader and his associates for a close working relationship with Republican textile magnate Roger Milliken, erstwhile major backer of the 1996 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan, and anti-unionization stalwart.|$|E
25|$|LaHaye {{also took}} more direct roles in presidential politics. He {{supported}} Ronald Reagan's elections as United States president. He was a co-chairman of Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential bid but {{was removed from}} the campaign after four days when anti-Catholic views which he had expressed became known. LaHaye {{played a significant role in}} getting <b>the</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Right</b> to support George W. Bush for the presidency in 2000. In 2007, he endorsed Mike Huckabee during the primaries and served as his spiritual advisor.|$|E

Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> and the Republican Party, with George W.

25|$|Factors {{that have}} been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include {{economic}} and political changes {{at the end of}} the 1970s, as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants. In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures. The backlash also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative Ronald Reagan in 1980 which also lead to Republican control of the United States Senate for the first time since 1954 plus the subsequent rise of <b>the</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Right</b> around the same time.|$|E
25|$|National Republicans such as Richard Nixon {{began to}} develop their Southern {{strategy}} to attract conservative white Southerners, especially {{the middle class and}} suburban voters, in addition to migrants from the North and traditional GOP pockets in Appalachia. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002. In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.|$|E

25|$|Owing {{largely to}} the {{prominence}} of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> in conservative politics in the United States, the Republican Party has taken positions regarded by many as outwardly hostile to the gay rights movement. Republicans have historically strongly opposed same-sex marriage (the party's overall attitude on civil unions is much more divided, with some in favor and others opposed), with the issue a galvanizing one that many believe helped George W. Bush win re-election in 2004. In both 2004 and 2006, congressional Republican leaders promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples. In both attempts, the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture, and thus, ultimately was never passed. As more states legalized same-sex marriage in the 2010s, Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy.|$|E
25|$|A major {{divide in}} {{political}} opinion separates the region's greatly more populated urban core {{and rural areas}} west of the mountains from its less populated rural areas to their east and (in British Columbia and Alaska) north. The coastal areas—especially in the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Portland, Eugene, and Ashland—are {{some of the most}} politically liberal parts of North America, regularly supporting left-wing political candidates and causes by significant majorities, while the Interior and North tend to be more conservative and consistently support right-wing candidates and causes. It should be noted that <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> has far less influence throughout the region than elsewhere in the U.S., and that certain areas of the BC Interior, particularly the West Kootenay and some areas of Vancouver Island and the BC Coast, have long histories of labour, environmental and social activism (see History of British Columbia#Rise of the labour movement).|$|E
25|$|Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table {{his experience as a}} senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's views that he became a vocal opponent of <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>right</b> on issues such as abortion, gay rights, and {{the role of religion in}} public life. After narrowly winning re-election to the Senate in 1980, he chose not to run for a sixth term in 1986, and was succeeded by fellow Republican John McCain. A significant accomplishment in his career was the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by placing the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.|$|E

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of making a determination in the matter, the court {{found it necessary to}} adopt the approach most favourable to the appellant and assume, without deciding, that <b>the</b> appellant's <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> under sections 15 and 31(1) were both in issue. It was also necessary to assume, again without deciding, that corporal punishment as practised by the appellant's members was not inconsistent with any provision of the Bill of Rights as contemplated by section 31(2). In the light of these assumptions, section 10 of the Act limited <b>the</b> parents' <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> both under section 31 and under section 15.|$|R

25|$|Jerome Himmelstein {{identified}} two main {{theories about the}} appeal of antifeminism {{and its role in}} opposition to the ERA. One theory is that it was a clash between upper-class liberal voters and the older, more conservative lower-class rural voters who often serve as the center for right-wing movements; in other words, this theory identifies particular social classes as more inherently friendly to antifeminism. Another theory holds that women who feel vulnerable and dependent on men are likely to oppose anything that threatens that tenuous stability; under this view, while educated, independent career women may support feminism, housewives who lack such resources are more drawn to antifeminism. Himmelstein, however, says both views are at least partially wrong, arguing that the primary dividing line between feminists and antifeminists is cultural rather than stemming from differences in economic and social status. There are, in fact, similarities between income between activists {{on both sides of the}} ERA debate. As it turned out, the most indicative factors when predicting ERA position, especially among women, were race, marital status, age, and education. ERA opposition was much higher among white, married, older, and less educated citizens. Women who opposed the ERA tended to fit characteristics consistent with <b>the</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Right.</b>|$|E

40|$|Native peoples {{account for}} {{a disproportionate number of}} inmates in the current American prison population.

In the course of this paper I will discuss the disparities in <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> accommodation of Native inmates, explore how <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> of imprisoned Natives have been violated, and present arguments concerning the validity of spirituality as a means of inmate therapy and rehabilitation...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire (contracts with European powers) were negotiated, {{protecting}} <b>the</b> <b>religious</b> <b>rights</b> of Christians {{within the}} Empire.

Many civil rights organizations also were not supportive, such as the Human Rights Campaign, which argued that the policy's exclusion of transgender individuals rendered the ordinance not worth defending.|$|R
