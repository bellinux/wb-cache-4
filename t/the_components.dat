5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, <b>the</b> <b>components</b> of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of <b>the</b> <b>components</b> of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for cleaning surface of precision processing aluminum containing <b>component,</b> comprises treating <b>the</b> <b>component</b> with a cleaning agent with a pH value of less than 6, which dissolves aluminum containing passivation layer present on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>component,</b> under removal of contaminations contained in the passivation layer, cleaning <b>the</b> <b>component</b> with water under formation of a fluid film wetting the surface of <b>the</b> <b>component,</b> drying <b>the</b> <b>component</b> through controlled removal of the fluid film, and developing a homogeneous or contamination free passivation layer. The cleaning agent is watery solution containing hydroxycarboxylic acid with an acid concentration of 0. 5 - 3 wt. % and a pH value of 2 - 4. <b>The</b> <b>component</b> is wetted with water, watery solution of surfactant, alcohol and/or watery solution of alcohol. The water has a conductance of maximum 0. 5 mu S/cm.

The partial wetting of <b>the</b> <b>component</b> with deionised water is carried out at a water temperature of 15 - 25 degrees C and the partial wetting of <b>the</b> <b>component</b> with watery solution of acid is carried out at acid temperature of 50 - 70 degrees C. USE - Method for cleaning surface of precision processing aluminum containing component such as reflexive and/or reflective optical component, mirror, patterns, reference object, tools, baffle, frames and grating (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method ensures cleaning of surface of precision processing aluminum containing component with high standards of cleanliness and high optical quality...|$|R
