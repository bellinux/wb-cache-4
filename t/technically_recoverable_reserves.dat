50|$|However, {{implementing}} Pickens Plan {{does not}} require {{an increase in the}} supply of natural gas; it calls for a shift in its use, rather than an increase. Natural gas production has been slightly and consistently increasing in the United States for more than two decades. Proven recoverable U.S. gas reserves have slightly but consistently risen since 1996 and are about the same as in 1976.Estimates of <b>technically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> in the United States vary as they are generated by geological inferences, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration 2009 estimate is 1747 trillion cubic feet, enough to provide domestic production at 2005 rates for nearly 80 years.|$|E
30|$|Pakistan’s {{shale gas}} {{reserves}} of about 105 trillion cubic feet {{have been reported}} by EIA’s (2013), and these reported reserves are <b>technically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of the country. However, Pakistan’s E&P companies are reluctant to invest their capital on such low permeable reservoirs, as the gas production from tight gas sandstone reservoirs is often marginally profitable; reducing costs is a key strategy for every investor and to improve profitability from such low-permeability reservoirs. For profitability and increased gas recovery from shale gas reservoirs, {{it is essential for}} government to provide investors with certain incentives and security for development of shale gas reservoirs. However, the development of such resources is extremely challenging because of instability within the region, difficult to access the locations, the gas prices in Pakistan and key thing is the constraints related to environmental. Although Pakistan has huge amount of shale gas reserves and conventional gas reserves, it has declined steadily over the years. More recently, many national and multinational companies have also made gas discoveries but are not enough to compensate production declines.|$|E

5000|$|As of 2013 the Cline Shale, also {{referred}} to as the [...] "Wolfcamp/Cline Shale", the [...] "Lower Wolfcamp Shale,", or the [...] "Spraberry-Wolfcamp shale", or even the [...] "Wolfberry", is a promising Pennsylvanian oil play east of Midland, Texas which underlies 10 counties: Fisher, Nolan, Sterling, Coke, Glasscock, Tom Green, Howard, Mitchell, Borden and Scurry County, Texas. Exploitation is projected to rely on hydraulic fracturing.an organic rich shale, with Total Organic Content (TOC) of 1-8%, with silt and sand beds mixed in. It lies in a broad shelf, with minimal relief and has nice light oil of 38-42 gravity with excellent porosity of 6-12% in thickness varying 200 to 550 feet thick. The total recovery was estimated to 30 billion barrels in 2012, and United States Geological Survey estimated the <b>technically</b> <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> to 20 billion barrels in 2016, the largest USGS estimate ever and nearly three times larger than that of the 2013 USGS Bakken-Three Forks resource assessment in North Dakota. The field also seems to contain 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This is the first assessment of continuous resources in the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian. During the 1980s, vertical wells produced oil in the Wolfcamp area. However, since 2000 in North America, horizontal drilling or porpoising along with hydraulic fracturing have grown tremendously and are tapping the continuous oil reserve. In Odessa, Chris Schenk, a Denver-based research geologist and assessment team member, told KWES, [...] "This oil has been known {{there for a long time}} -- our task is to estimate what we think the volume of recoverable oil is." [...] According to Morris Burns, a local oil expert and former president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, 50% to 60% is recoverable beginning at a price range of $60 to $65 per barrell. This area is the largest continuous oil discovery in the United States and encompasses the cities of both Lubbock and Midland which are 118 miles apart.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a prolific deep water marine source rock (it has been called the world's largest oil source rock) the formation is believed to contain substantial reserves of tight oil. An estimate by Wood Mackenzie of the Bazhenov Formation puts oil in place at 2 trillion barrels. In 2013, the Russian oil company Rosneft estimated <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of 22 billion barrels for the formation.

40|$|Gas fracking: can we safely {{squeeze the}} rocks? Hydrological {{fracturing}} techniques have made accessible vast unconventional gas reserves. However, observed {{impacts on the}} environment and human health raise legitimate public concerns. The potential climate benefits of coal-to-gas substitution are both less clear and more limited than initially claimed. The question of whether to allow or ban gas fracking needs to be carefully assessed by relevant authorities. A review of current related policies and regulations is critically needed. Why is this issue important? Fossil fuels are the world's main source of energy, accounting for 81 % of global primary energy use in 2010 (IEA, 2011). However, as conventional reserves are depleted (IEA, 2010) and demand for energy rises, there is increasing pressure to exploit unconventional energy sources (UNEP, 2011 a; UNEP, 2011 b). Hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) is a gas extraction technique used in low permeable rocks. This is referred as unconventional gas (UG) production. UG has triggered both strong opposition and heightened economic interest.
