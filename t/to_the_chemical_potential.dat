40|$|At high densities and low temperatures, the {{conventional}} Widom test particle method <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> {{of a system}} of particles with excluded volume interactions fails owing to bad statistics. A way to circumvent this problem is the use of expanded ensemble simulation techniques or thermodynamic integration.

The advantage of our technique is that the densities of states of the N and N + 1 particle system are computed in an ensemble in which particles can pass each other, resulting in a more efficient sampling. We will demonstrate our method not only for single particles but also for chain molecules with intramolecular interactions. By using an infinite temperature expansion and an extension of the density of states to very high energies, we will show that it is also possible <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> without having <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> density of states for the N + 1 particle system...|$|R
