5000|$|... "Understanding in a Car Crash" [...] is a {{prime example}} of Thursday's style of emotional, poetic lyrics and {{instrumentation}} paired with intense backup screams, heavy chords, and fierce percussion. It begins quickly with matching snare hits immediately followed by a full ensemble led by a dizzying lead guitar and cymbal-crashing introduction. As the verse begins, a somber lead riff takes over backed a steady beat, crooning bass, and melodic, clean vocals detailing <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> physical <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> a car wreck. The chorus returns to the introductory heaviness with aggressive, cracked backup vocals, intense drumming, and whirling guitars.|$|R

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished {{the death penalty in}} all circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> many {{thousands}} <b>of</b> Hungarians were arrested.

Hundreds were also deported to the Soviet Union, many without evidence. Approximately 200,000 fled Hungary as refugees. Former Hungarian Foreign Minister Géza Jeszenszky estimated 350 were executed. Sporadic resistance and strikes by workers' councils continued until mid-1957, causing economic disruption. By 1963, most political prisoners from the 1956 Hungarian revolution had been released.|$|R

5000|$|The Stewarts of Ardsheal {{were the}} most {{important}} Cadet family of the Stewarts of Appin. Totally loyal to the Jacobite cause, Stewart of Ardsheal led the regiment raised by the Stewarts of Appin at Culloden. They suffered appalling casualties when breaking the ranks of Barrell’s and Munro’s regiments of foot of the Hanoverian army. However the outcome of Culloden was almost certain before it began. The Jacobite army, tired, hungry, improperly equipped and grossly out numbered were decisively defeated. After their victory the English, led by the Duke of Cumberland, were ordered to execute all the Jacobite wounded and imprisoned. For this he was hereafter known as [...] "The Butcher".Having escaped death both in battle and <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> Stewart <b>of</b> Ardsheal made for his family seat, Ardsheal House, Kentallen Bay. His hope was that if he could evade capture for long enough some sort of amnesty or deal would eventually be struck.

5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was light, with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} minor actions {{followed}} as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway. After {{a month of}} fighting, the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the Japanese sued for peace and hostilities came to an end. During the fighting in Borneo the 2/33rd had lost 25 dead and 57 wounded. In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war, the Australians remained on Borneo as an occupation force, while the Army was slowly demobilised. During this time the battalion was steadily reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for discharge, or were transferred to other units for further service, including providing personnel to the 34th Brigade, which was raised for occupation duties in Japan.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath,</b> Julie Siddiqi <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic Society of Britain {{expressed}} concern that the killing would be used to create ethnic and community divisions.

Across London our officers are in contact with their communities too." [...] Commander Simon Letchford later noted community concerns following the incident and assured that an investigation was under way. He also appealed for calm and avoidance of speculation. An additional 1,200 police officers were deployed across London to prevent revenge attacks on Muslim communities.|$|R
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in <b>the</b> smog's <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|R
500|$|Approximately 100 {{people lived}} {{in the path of}} destruction, located between the CPR tracks and the river. The death toll is uncertain; {{estimates}} range between 70 and 90. [...] It is the deadliest landslide in Canadian history and was the largest until the Hope Slide in 1965. [...] It is possible that the toll may have been higher, since as many as 50 transients had been camped {{at the base of the}} mountain while looking for work. Some residents believed that they had left Frank shortly before the slide, though there is no way to be certain. Most of the victims remain entombed beneath the rocks; only 12 bodies were recovered in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath.</b> <b>The</b> skeletons <b>of</b> six additional victims were unearthed in 1924 by crews building a new road through the slide.|$|R
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{the fort}} {{remained}} standing into the 1840s; in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war's conclusion {{the site was}} occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased {{the land and the}} fort from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from the fort, dismantling it in the process, and used them to construct a barn on his property. The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. <b>The</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
50|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} the bomb had been {{attached to a}} parked motorbike. The blast dealt severe damage to buildings in the area, destroying at least one two-story house and trapping many under rubble. Sporadic gunfire was reported after the attack, and locals were reportedly hesitant to approach the site in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> for fear <b>of</b> more bombs. Angry members of the Hazara minority set up roadblocks with burning tires and fired into the air {{in order to keep}} people away from the blast site in case of a second attack. Photos from the scene showed groups of desperate people rushing the injured into ambulances and private vehicles, as emergency services quickly became overloaded. Nevertheless, police forces worked throughout the evening and into the night, with the death toll being updated several times due to more bodies being pulled out from beneath rubble.|$|R
50|$|Tempest Anderson {{spent nine}} months in Mexico, Guatemala and the West Indies in 1906/1907.

The eruption was heard as far away as Guatemala City, the noises so strong, they were assumed to come from neighbouring volcanoes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) on the competitive advantage of All-Star analysts. We find that Institutional Investor All-Americans, chosen by the votes of institutional investors based on overall helpfulness to the buy-side, experienced {{a significant increase in}} turnover during <b>the</b> implementation and <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> Reg FD. We do not observe a similar change in the Institutional Investor buy-side rankings of non-U. S. analysts or in the Wall Street Journal’s Best on the Street rankings which are based solely on returns generated from the analyst’s public stock recommendations. Furthermore, the significant change in All-American rankings is concentrated in those sectors identified by DIRI and Hutton (2005) as being most affected by Reg FD. By 2003, the competitive environment for All-Americans had stabilized, with turnover returning to (approximately) pre-Reg FD levels. This suggests that within a few years, All-Americans had built a new competitive advantage stressing aspects of performance less dependent on privileged communication with management. ...|$|R
