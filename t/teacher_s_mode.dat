This Paper speaks about structure and ideas of the <b>teacher</b> <b>s</b> Organizations. The Work focus on some themes namely: Reform of <b>teacher</b> <b>s</b> education, possibilities of cooperation among <b>Teacher</b> <b>s</b> Associations and so- called "Příhodovskou" reform. The Paper treats of the situation in the German language area and in Slovakia and also of course in Czech Associations. The Work is based on analysis of press from 1918 till 1938, which provide the presentable summary about ideas and positions of the most important <b>Teacher</b> <b>s</b> Organizations. The Diploma Paper pointed to the fundamental importance of <b>Teacher</b> <b>s</b> Organization for reformative Efforts in Czechoslovakia. The <b>Teacher</b> <b>s</b> Associations were big Organizations with wide activities (such as: social, promotive, educational, tutorial) and they substituted for the role of country (f. e. the Foundation of privat university).

40|$|AbstractIn small cell-attached patches {{containing}} one {{and only}} one Na+ channel, inactivation was studied in three different gating modes, namely, the fast-inactivating F mode and the more slowly inactivating <b>S</b> <b>mode</b> and P mode with similar inactivation kinetics. In each of these modes, ensemble-averaged currents could be fitted with a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model with a single exponential for inactivation (τh). τh declined from 1. 0 ms at − 60 mV to 0. 1 ms at 0 mV in the F mode, from 4. 6 ms at − 40 mV to 1. 1 ms at 0 mV in the <b>S</b> <b>mode,</b> and from 4. 5 ms at − 40 mV to 0. 8 ms at + 20 mV in the P mode, respectively. The probability of non-empty traces (net), {{the mean number of}} openings per non-empty trace (op/tr), and the mean open probability per trace (popen) were evaluated at 4 -ms test pulses. net inclined from 30 % at − 60 mV to 63 % at 0 mV in the F mode, from 4 % at − 90 mV to 90 % at 0 mV in the <b>S</b> <b>mode,</b> and from 2 % at − 60 mV to 79 % at + 20 mV in the P mode. op/tr declined from 1. 4 at − 60 mV to 1. 1 at 0 mV in the F mode, from 4. 0 at − 60 mV to 1. 2 at 0 mV in the <b>S</b> <b>mode,</b> and from 2. 9 at − 40 mV to 1. 6 at + 20 mV in the P mode. popen was bell-shaped with a maximum of 5 % at − 30 mV in the F mode, 48 % at − 50 mV in the <b>S</b> <b>mode,</b> and 16 % at 0 mV in the P mode. It is concluded that 1) a switch between F and <b>S</b> <b>modes</b> may reflect a functional change of inactivation, 2) a switch between <b>S</b> and P <b>modes</b> may reflect a functional change of activation, 3) τh is mainly determined by the latency until the first channel opening in the F mode and by the number of reopenings in the <b>S</b> and P <b>modes,</b> 4) at least in the <b>S</b> and P <b>modes,</b> inactivation is independent of pore opening, and 5) in the <b>S</b> <b>mode,</b> mainly open channels inactivate, and in the P mode, mainly closed channels inactivate...|$|R

40|$|Context. Quasi-periodic {{pulsations}} (QPP) of {{the electromagnetic}} radiation emitted in solar and stellar flares are often detected in microwave, white light, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. Mechanisms for QPP are intensively debated in the literature. Previous studies revealed that QPP may manifest non-linear, non-stationary and, perhaps, multi-modal processes operating in flares. Aims. We study QPP of the microwave emission generated in an X 3. 2 -class solar flare on 14 May, 2013, observed with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), aiming to reveal signatures of the non-linear, non-stationary, and multi-modal processes in the signal. Methods. The NoRH correlation signal obtained at the 17 GHz intensity has a clear QPP pattern. The signal was analysed with the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) that allows one to determine its instant amplitude and frequency, and their time variation. Results. It was established that the QPP consists {{of at least three}} well-defined intrinsic modes, with the mean periods of 15, 45, and 100 <b>s.</b> All the <b>modes</b> have quasi-harmonic behaviour with different modulation patterns. The 100 <b>s</b> intrinsic <b>mode</b> is a decaying oscillation, with the decay time of 250 s. The 15 <b>s</b> intrinsic <b>mode</b> shows a similar behaviour, with the decay time of 90 s. The 45 <b>s</b> <b>mode</b> has a wave-train behaviour. Conclusions. Dynamical properties of detected intrinsic modes indicate that the 100 s and 15 <b>s</b> <b>modes</b> are likely to be associated with fundamental kink and sausage modes of the flaring loop, respectively. The 100 s oscillation could also be caused by the fundamental longitudinal mode, while this interpretation requires the plasma temperature of about 30 million K and hence is not likely. The 45 <b>s</b> <b>mode</b> could be the second standing harmonics of the kink mode...|$|R

40|$|Background: Unintentional leaks, patient-ventilatory asynchrony, and obstructive {{or central}} events (either {{residual}} or induced by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NPPV]) occur in patients treated with NPPV, but {{the impact of}} ventilator settings on these disturbances has been little explored. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of backup respiratory rate (BURR) settings on the efficacy of ventilation, sleep structure, subjective sleep quality, and respiratory events in a group of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Methods: Ten stable patients with OHS treated with long-term nocturnal NPPV underwent polysomnographic recordings and transcutaneous capnography on 3 consecutive nights with three different settings for BURR in random order: spontaneous (<b>S)</b> <b>mode,</b> low BURR, and high BURR. No other ventilator parameter was modified. Results: The <b>S</b> <b>mode</b> was associated with the occurrence of a highly significant increase in respiratory events, mainly of central and mixed origin, when compared with both spontaneous/timed (S/T) modes. Accordingly, the oxygen desaturation index was significantly higher in the <b>S</b> <b>mode</b> than in either of the S/T modes. The results of nocturnal transcutaneous PCO 2 (PtcCO 2) (mean value and time spent with PtcCO 2 > 50 mm Hg) were similar over the three consecutive nocturnal recordings. The quality of sleep was perceived as slightly better, and the number of perceived arousals as lower with the low- vs high-BURR (S/T) mode. Conclusions: In a homogenous group of patients treated with long-term NPPV for obesity-hypoventilation, changing BURR from an S/T mode with a high or low BURR to an <b>S</b> <b>mode</b> was associated with the occurrence of a highly significant increase in respiratory events, of mainly central and mixed origin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relationship}} between causal attribution beliefs of students and their self-esteem. The sample of the study comprised of 3614 students including 1868 male and 1746 female students studying in the 10 th grade from 72 public sector schools across 6 districts (selected on the geographical basis) of Punjab. The data were collected by using two research instruments. A 5 -point rating scale, Causal Attribution Beliefs Scale (CABS) was used to measure causal attributions beliefs of students. Eight attributes were included in the instrument i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. <b>s</b> influence and <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence. Another instrument, a 5 -point rating scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure self-esteem of the students. According to the nature of the data and to address the research questions, different statistical techniques i. e. inferential statistics like Independent Sample t-Tests, MANOVA, Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were applied. The results of the study revealed that students endorsed all given causes (ability, effort, strategy, interest, luck, task difficulty, parent. <b>s</b> influence and <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence) as a potential cause of both success and failure. Identical patterns of success were observed in mathematics and English. Both girls and boys ranked <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence, effort and parent. s influence as their prime causes of success in mathematics. Both male students and female students believe <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence, effort, parent influence and ability as the primary causes of their success in English. However, there were significant differences in failure attribution patterns. Male students consider lack of effort, lack of interest and wrong use of strategy as the main causes of their failure in mathematics. Whereas, female students considered lack of effort, wrong use of strategy and task difficulty as major causes of their failure in mathematics. In the same way, male students. main causes of failure in English were ranked as lack of interest, lack of effort and wrong use of strategy. While female students ranked failure causes in English as lack of effort, task difficulty and wrong use of strategy. Majority of the students showed high self-esteem levels. Only 14 % of the male students and 10 % of the female students exhibited low self-esteem level. Gender difference was found in self-esteem. Girls showed higher self-esteem level than boys. Similarly, urban students showed higher self-esteem level than rural students and science students showed higher self-esteem level than arts students. Relationship between causal attribution beliefs of students and self-esteem was found at secondary level. A small, negative but significant correlation was found in failure attributions and self-esteem level of the students. The relationship between failure attributions in mathematics and self-esteem was found in three attributions i. e. ability, luck and parent. s influence: whereas the relationship between failure attributions in English and self-esteem was found in five attributions i. e. ability, strategy, luck, parent. <b>s</b> influence and <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence. A small but positive correlation was found between success attributions and self-esteem level of the students. As far as success attributions in mathematics and self-esteem were concerned, four attributions i. e. ability, effort, interest and parent. s influence were positively correlated. Similarly, relationship between success attributions in English and self-esteem was found in six attributions i. e. ability, effort, strategy, interest, parent. <b>s</b> influence and <b>teacher.</b> <b>s</b> influence.
