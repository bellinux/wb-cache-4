5000|$|Prior to 2007, Ibn Warraq refused <b>to</b> show <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in public. This was due <b>to</b> {{fears for}} <b>his</b> {{personal}} safety and also due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> desire <b>to</b> travel <b>to</b> see <b>his</b> family in Pakistan without being denied access <b>to</b> Muslim countries. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> was blacked {{out on the}} ISIS website. [...] More recently, he has decided <b>to</b> show <b>his</b> <b>face</b> openly and take part in public debates.|$|R

5|$|Bart and Milhouse visit a joke shop. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so {{they can}} see the Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to a doctor instead, since he has superglued various novelty items <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, {{injured by}} bomb wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and head, Cherry was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{where he was}} commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 December.

5|$|The {{reason behind}} the pursuit was {{explained}} in the following episode in a promo, where he claimed that Vampiro rigged a casket with explosives during a match, with the explosion resulting in the damage done <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> On the eighth episode (which was taped on November 15, 2006) of the series, Banderas won the WSX Championship in his debut match for the promotion. Beforehand, {{he was involved in}} a series of brawls with Youth Suicide (Andre Verdun), as well as an allusion to a partnership with 6-Pac (Sean Waltman).|$|E
5|$|As {{the ships}} are {{prepared}} Sati {{gives birth to}} Kartik, her son with Shiva. The journey to Branga starts, with Sati staying back at Kashi to help the King with a lion attack on the local villagers. When Sati and her soldiers {{are on the verge}} of losing against the lions, a group of Naga soldiers led by a man and a woman arrive and assist them in killing the lions. The Naga woman reveals herself to be Kali, Sati's twin sister. She was denounced by their father Daksha since she was born with deformities, including two extra, functioning hands. The man reveals himself as Ganesh, Sati's first child, whom she believed to have died at child birth. Since Ganesh was also born with deformities, which led <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> resembling that of an elephant’s, Daksha denounced him and lied to Sati. Both Kali and Ganesh are brought back to Kashi by Sati and they wait for Shiva's arrival.|$|E
5|$|In class, Veronica and {{the whole}} class are asked to {{participate}} in Woody Goodman's (Steve Guttenberg) essay contest. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) invites Veronica to visit Hearst College. Logan abruptly breaks up with Hannah without giving an explanation, leaving her heartbroken. A student named Dean (Michael Cera) conducts Veronica and Wallace's tour of Hearst, and the pair suddenly run into Troy. Veronica mocks Troy <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> but he insists that he has changed his ways. At a party, {{one of the students}} hits on Veronica. The student gets more aggressive with Veronica, and when Troy begins to defend her, the student punches him. Later that night, Veronica sees Troy making out with Stacy (Alia Shawkat). When Veronica is sleeping, Troy calls her unexpectedly, pleading for help, and Veronica visits him at the police station, where he has been charged in the date-rape of Stacy. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) comes to the aid of Cliff (Daran Norris), from whom a briefcase of legal documents was stolen.|$|E

5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, Mölders was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. Mölders was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, Mölders asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating Mölders, Mölders approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|E
5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} of some kind. In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes into the ship. The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan {{responded to}} the ban by putting {{pressure}} on the state authorities to enforce isolation of the Johor hockey teams from all national tournaments. In November 1992, Douglas Gomez, a coach for the Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar field hockey team, expressed his displeasure of being called to withdraw from a semi-final national hockey match by the Director of the Johor Education Department. The incident {{attracted the attention of}} the Sultan, who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the Sultan. Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries.|$|E

50|$|Obsessively narcissist and vain, Vega {{considers}} himself {{the epitome of}} beauty and perfection. As such, he does not wear <b>his</b> expressionless mask <b>to</b> conceal <b>his</b> <b>face</b> or identity, as he removes it after winning fights, {{as well as in}} certain character-select images in various games he appears in. Instead, he wears the mask <b>to</b> protect <b>his</b> <b>face</b> from scarring or bruising during battle.|$|R
5|$|The future Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith {{served in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War, {{interrupting}} his studies at Rhodes University in South Africa to join up in 1941. Following a year's pilot instruction in Southern Rhodesia under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he was posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, then stationed in the Middle East, in late 1942. Smith received six weeks' operational training in the Levant, then entered active service as a pilot officer in Iran and Iraq. No. 237 Squadron, which had operated in the Western Desert from 1941 to early 1942, returned to that front in March 1943. Smith flew in the Western Desert until October that year, when a crash during a night takeoff resulted in serious injuries, including facial disfigurements and a broken jaw. Following reconstructive plastic surgery <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> other operations and five months' convalescence, Smith rejoined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica in May 1944. While there, he attained his highest rank, flight lieutenant.|$|E

25|$|To {{put that}} scale in another context, the {{comparative}} {{size of a}} nanometer to a meter {{is the same as}} that of a marble to the size of the earth.
