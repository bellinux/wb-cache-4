With the rapid advances in electronics, hardware, and software, 3 D imaging techniques can now be implemented with commercially available components and can be used for many applications. This volume discusses the state-of-the-art in 3 D display and visualization technologies, including binocular, multi-view, holographic, and image reproduction and capture techniques. It also covers 3 D optical systems, 3 D display instruments, 3 D imaging applications, and details several attractive methods for producing 3 D moving pictures. This book integrates the background material with new advances and applications in the field, and the available online supplement will include full color videos of 3 D <b>display</b> systems. <b>Three-Dimensional</b> <b>Imaging,</b> Visualization, and <b>Display</b> is suitable for electrical engineers, computer scientists, optical engineers, physicists, graduate students, government and industry technology managers, as well as anyone with an interest in this exciting future technology...|$|R
40|$|Holographic sensors are {{analytical}} {{devices that}} systematically diffract narrow-band {{light in the}} ultraviolet to near-infrared range for application in the detection and quantification of analytes and/or physical parameters. They can be functionalized with analyte-responsive materials to construct highly sensitive optical sensors for use in testing, where a visual readout, fast turnaround time, and reversibility are needed. Holography allows fabrication of disposable sensors that are lightweight for miniaturization and multiplexing purposes. 3 Holographic sensors offer three capabilities on a single analytical device: (i) label-free analyte-responsive polymer, (ii) real-time, reversible quantification of the external stimuli, and (iii) <b>three-dimensional</b> visual <b>image</b> <b>display...</b>|$|R
40|$|Information display {{technology}} is a rapidly growing research and development field. Using state-of-the-art technology, optical resolution can be increased dramatically by organic light-emitting diode - since the light emitting layer is very thin, under 100 nm. The main question is what pixel size is achievable technologically? The next generation of display will considers <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> <b>display.</b> In 2 D, one is considering vertical and horizontal resolutions. In 3 D or holographic images, there is another dimension – depth. The major requirement is the high resolution horizontal dimension in order to sustain the third dimension using special lenticular glass or barrier masks, separate views for each eye. The high-resolution 3 D display offers hundreds of more different views of objects or landscape. OLEDs have {{potential to be a}} key technology for information displays in the future. The {{display technology}} presented in this work promises to bring into use bright colour 3 D flat panel displays in a unique way. Unlike the conventional TFT matrix, OLED displays have constant brightness and colour, independent from the viewing angle i. e. the observer's position in front of the screen. A sandwich (just 0. 1 micron thick) of organic thin films between two conductors makes an OLE Display device. These special materials are named electroluminescent organic semi-conductors (or organic photoconductors (OPC)). When electrical current is applied, a bright light is emitted (electrophosphorescence) from the formed Organic Light-Emitting Diode. Usually for OLED an ITO layer is used as a transparent electrode. Such types of displays were the first for volume manufacture and only a few products are available in the market at present. The key challenges that OLED technology faces in the application areas are: producing high-quality white light achieving low manufacturing costs increasing efficiency and lifetime at high brightness. Looking towards the future, by combining OLED with specially constructed surface lenses and proper image management software {{it will be possible to}} achieve 3 D images...|$|E

We also report the implementation of stereogram computing techniques that employ the PC hardware acceleration to generate and update holographic images at rates of up to two frames per second. These innovations shrink the system’s physical footprint to fit on the table-top and mark the fastest rate at which full computation and update have been achieved on this system to date.
