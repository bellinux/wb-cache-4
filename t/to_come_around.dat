5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E

500|$|After the {{intermediate}} sprint – won by Chavanel – the breakaway broke up, with Tjallingii and Gougeard continuing in the lead; {{at one point}} they were 1' 40" [...] ahead of the chasing peloton. The peloton was controlled by Tinkoff-Saxo (riding for Peter Sagan) and Giant-Alpecin (riding for John Degenkolb). The combined pressure of these teams caused Caleb Ewan (...) to be dropped and the breakaway was caught soon afterwards. Giant-Alpecin led out the sprint, but Sagan and Bouhanni were able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> Degenkolb and Sagan took the stage victory. The victory was Sagan's first in a Grand Tour in over two years, since stage 7 of the 2013 Tour de France.|$|E

On the last of these attacks, Hayman accelerated past him and the two riders came together into the velodrome, with Vanmarcke joining soon afterwards. With one [...] lap remaining, Stannard and Boasson Hagen rejoined the group. Hayman led out the sprint: Boonen was on his wheel and Stannard came around the outside. Neither was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> him and Hayman crossed the line first to take the victory. Boonen was second with Stannard third. Vanmarcke finished with them in fourth place; Boasson Hagen was three seconds behind in fifth place.|$|E

He was pleased in 1775 when the colonies began to replace their old governments with independent republican governments. He praised Thomas Paine's popular pamphlet Common Sense, writing as [...] "Candidus" [...] in early 1776, and supported the call for American independence. On June 7, Adams's political ally Richard Henry Lee introduced a three-part resolution calling for Congress to declare independence, create a colonial confederation, and seek foreign aid.

GameSpot commended it as [...] "not just a fine Castlevania game—it's also one of the better Game Boy Advance games <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> in a while". GameSpy stated: [...] "Despite its unevenness, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance is a quality adventure that represents the best attempt yet made at miniaturizing the brilliance of Symphony of the Night." [...] While worrying about the loss of originality of the franchise and noting that [...] "Harmony of Dissonance almost obsessively copies Symphony of the Night", GamePro called it [...] "a fun action game and a fine Castlevania game in its own right." [...] The improved graphics of Harmony of Dissonance, especially the backgrounds, 3D effects, and multi-jointed bosses, received praise from reviewers, who called them [...] "plentiful and visually stunning", and [...] "top-notch".|$|E
500|$|Before the 2015 season, Pujols {{enjoyed his}} first offseason {{in his time}} with the Angels {{in which he was}} either free of injury or {{recuperation}} from injury. [...] However, his offensive production lagged behind his career levels the first month of the season. [...] By the end of April, Pujols was batting [...]208 with three home runs and nine RBI in 86 plate appearances. [...] While it was suggested that this was because of older age, or his recent poor health while with the Angels, it seemed to be simply due to bad luck. [...] The next month, Pujols' offensive production had started <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around.</b> [...] Between May 28, 2015 and June 22, 2015, he batted [...]356 with 15 homers, 30 RBI and 1.326 OPS.

500|$|Dawson and Powter {{included}} the song on a disc that was offered to record labels that asked Powter to audition in New York; but {{his lack of}} stage presence led to the labels turning him down. Disappointed, he returned to Vancouver to move on because: [...] "once a record company says no, it's difficult <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> again". After this failure, his new representative, Gary Stamler, played a demo tape for Tom Whalley, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Records. Whalley offered Powter a contract but {{he was reluctant to}} sign it because he considered himself primarily a songwriter. He accepted the offer in April 2003 and, along with Dawson and producer Mitchell Froom, worked on his album and the song in Los Angeles, California. The album was originally recorded in Powter's Vancouver apartment but Warner Bros. asked that it be rerecorded. However, because Froom wanted to keep its [...] "original feel", in Powter's words it was just [...] "touch up".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "neo-operatic" [...] {{opening track}} [...] "Foolish Love", {{arranged}} by Van Dyke Parks, {{was described by}} Allmusic contributor Matthew Greenwald as a [...] "lush, orchestral-soaked ballad, with incredible strings". He asserted that Wainwright's lyrics {{took the form of}} a letter to himself, defining his goals and [...] "sense of purpose". The song [...] "Danny Boy", with its [...] "fabulous wordplay that stays literate and easy to understand at the time", contains [...] "subtle" [...] horn lines and sampled percussion. The song alludes to Wainwright's homosexuality, which Greenwald considered a [...] "brave move". According to biographer Kirk Lake, [...] "Danny Boy" [...] is a companion piece to [...] "Foolish Love" [...] and together they represent the start and end of a relationship between a gay and a straight man. Danny, the straight [...] "drug-addled" [...] title figure with whom Wainwright had a three-year relationship, is the subject of both songs in addition to others on the album; he appears in the album's collage artwork. Wainwright sings of being so blinded by love that he fails to notice the [...] "ship with eight sails" [...] threatening <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> the bend, a reference to Bertolt Brecht's 1928 musical The Threepenny Opera.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E
500|$|Klemme got the team's first-ever win {{early in}} the spring season, at Le Samyn. After a solo escapee was caught by an elite 12-rider group that came clear of the peloton, Klemme timed his attack on the day's final climb with {{precision}} and stayed out front for victory by eight seconds over Kevyn Ista. The team came to the first monument race of the season, Milan–San Remo, with high ambitions. Cancellara aimed for a second triumph in the race, having previously won the 2008 edition, but he recognized that slipping away unmarked in the race's final kilometers as he did three years prior {{would be difficult to}} do again. He considered Philippe Gilbert to be his principal rival for the race. Cancellara and O'Grady made the day's major selection on the Le Manie climb, after a crash [...] from the finish. O'Grady hit out on the attack a few times shortly {{before the end of the}} race, but it was Cancellara who was present in an eight-rider group that formed on the Poggio which decided the race. These eight riders represented eight different teams, so no one was able to get a proper leadout. After Gilbert, Vincenzo Nibali, and Yoann Offredo opened up the sprint, Cancellara tried <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>around</b> them for the win, but was beaten at the line by 's Matthew Goss. Cancellara was deeply disappointed to finish second, feeling that even though he had done one of the best sprints of his life, he had not done adequately to pay off his team's efforts on the day.|$|E
