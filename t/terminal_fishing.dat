40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{reconstruct}} historical sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) runs to Bristol Bay, Alaska {{for use by the}} Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) in evaluating biological escapement goals for component populations. Annual inshore run sizes (1963 - 2011) were reconstructed for each of the 18 observed age classes by partitioning annual catches from the mixed-stock <b>terminal</b> <b>fishing</b> districts and accounting for observed interception of stocks in non-destination fishing districts. Age and genetic composition of catch data were used to partition catches and estimate escapement age composition for years in which those data were unavailable. Results of this reconstruction process indicate that in western Bristol Bay the traditional run reconstruction methods routinely overestimated the productivity (recruits/spawner) of Igushik River (mean: 32 %) and Nushagak River (mean: 15 %) stocks while underestimating the productivity of the Wood River stock. In eastern Bristol Bay, differences in annual productivity estimated by the run reconstruction procedure incorporating both age and genetic-composition of catch data and that estimated by traditional methods were more varied across the time series, with productivity of the Egegik River stock routinely overestimated (mean: 9 %) and productivity of the Alagnak River stock routinely underestimated (mean: 15 %) by the traditional method. ...|$|E

40|$|Georges Bank is {{a highly}} {{productive}} marine ecosystem {{with a long history}} of exploitation. This ecosystem has undergone profound changes in fish abundance and species composition in the past three decades. In this dissertation, I applied multispecies virtual population analysis to the Georges Bank fish community to evaluate the combined effects of harvesting and predation on the fish-community structure. By applying MSVPA to nine commercially and ecologically important fish species on Georges Bank, I estimated predation mortality of prey species, fishing mortality, and population abundance from 1978 to 1992. The results indicated that predation mortality on the prey species was highest at ages 0 and 1 and was much higher than the fishing mortalities for these species. As a consequence, recruitment levels were mediated by predation. The sensitivity of MSVPA to perturbations in the inputs was assessed with a two-level fractional factorial experimental design that included ten factors and nine response variables. Results of the sensitivity test indicated that MSVPA model outputs were most sensitive to predator consumption rates and <b>terminal</b> <b>fishing</b> mortalities. ^ In this study, I evaluated the consequences of different harvest policies under single and multispecies models by constructing an adaptive management framework for the Georges Bank fish community. The single-species virtual population analysis and two multispecies virtual population analysis runs based on two different sets of predator-consumption rates were used as alternative hypotheses to describe population dynamics; these three models were used to evaluate three harvest policies. The sum of cumulative revenues over species was used as a criterion to evaluate the performance of each hypothesis-policy combination in the adaptive-management framework. The best harvest policy was a conservative policy that allowed the valuable demersal species to recover and maintain a sustainable yield. ...|$|E

FISH with four DNA probes was used to examine the involvement of specific chromosomes or chromosome fragments in gamma ray-induced micronuclei formation and then to explain their origin. Additionally, a comparison of the possible origin of the micronuclei induced by physical and chemical treatment: maleic hydrazide (MH) and N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) was done. The micronuclei induced by gamma ray could originate from acentric fragments after chromosome breakage or from whole lagging chromosomes {{as a result of a}} dysfunction of the mitotic apparatus.

Comparison of the terminal year F and SSB with the biological reference points found the stock to be overfished (SSB 2007 / SSBmsy = 1, 922 / 7, 790 = 0. 25) and undergoing overfishing (F 2007 / Fmsy = 0. 414 / 0. 239 = 1. 73).

40|$|Two {{monkfish}} {{species are}} caught {{off the coast}} of Namibia. These are Lophius vomerinus Valenciennes (1837) and L. vaillanti Regan (1903). L. vomerinus is the more abundant of the two and contributes approximately 99 % to the total Namibian monkfish landings. The Namibian monkfish fishery {{is one of the largest}} and most valuable of its kind in the world. Two fishing fleets harvest the resource, viz. the monkfish and sole fleet and the hake directed fleet. In 1998 and 1999, monkfish were also harvested by one gillnet vessel that had an experimental right. In this study, the biology, abundance and exploitation patterns of monkfish were investigated and used as inputs into a stock assessment framework as a contribution towards the development of a management procedure for this species. Ground and sectioned otoliths and sectioned illicia were used to age Lophius vomerinus. The illicia provided more precise estimates of age, and growth was subsequently modelled using these age estimates. Growth in length and weight was best described by the threeparameter specialised von Bertalanffy model as Lt (cm TL) = 72. 29 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁴⁽t⁺°·³°⁾) and Wt (kg) = 3. 96 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁺°·¹°⁾) ²·⁹⁹ for males, and Lt (cm TL) = 111. 98 (1 -e⁻°·°⁸⁽t⁺°·³⁶⁾) and Wt (kg) = 6. 92 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁻°·⁶⁴⁾) ³·°³ for females. L. vomerinus is a slow-growing species with a life span in excess of 10 years. Reproductive activity was shown to occur throughout the year, with a slight peak during the winter months. The adult sex ratio of fish > 37 cm TL was biased towards females. Length-at- 50 % sexual maturity was attained at 32. 1 cm TL for females and 23. 7 cm TL for males. The rate of natural mortality was estimated at 0. 15 year⁻¹, while fishing mortality rates during the 1970 s, 1980 s and 1990 s were estimated at 0. 01 year⁻¹, 0. 04 year⁻¹ and 0. 14 year⁻¹, respectively. Gillnetting for monkfish (300 mm stretched mesh) was highly efficient with a moderate bycatch of around 20 % during the two years of operation. The main bycatch species were red crab, spider crab, squalid sharks, rays and Cape and Deep-water hake. The mean length of the monkfish caught in gillnets (67 cm TL) was significantly larger than the monkfish landed by the trawlers (38 cm TL) and less than 1 % of immature fish were landed. Gillnet catch-per-unit-effort for monkfish fluctuated between 0. 03 and 0. 67 kg. day⁻¹. 50 m net panel⁻¹, with a soak time of between one and sixteen days. More than 50 % (by weight) of monkfish landed by monkfish and sole trawlers, consisted of fish below 36 cm TL. There was a significant increase in catches of juvenile monkfish during 1997 and 1998 in comparison to the period 1994 to 1996. Various types of rigid sorting grids were tested to release juvenile monkfish below 32 cm TL. Five grid designs were tested. These included an “Ex-it” grid with horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm, single grids with vertical and horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm and grids with circular openings of 110 and 168 mm in diameter. The most efficient design was the grid with circular openings of 110 cm in diameter, which ensured the escape of 66 % of monkfish smaller than 31 cm TL. However, studies need to be undertaken to quantify the survival of released fish and to test the feasibility of using grid sorters on commercial monkfish and sole trawling gear. The monkfish resource was assessed by means of length cohort analyses, the Thompson and Bell predictive model and by way of a deterministic age-structured production modelling approach. The length cohort analysis models were sensitive to the rate of natural mortality and insensitive to changes in the <b>terminal</b> <b>fishing</b> mortality rate. These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes. Fish ranging between 26 and 59 cm TL are the most heavily exploited. The Thompson and Bell model predicted that the monkfish resource is exploited above MSY -levels and a reduction of approximately 40 % in fishing effort would provide a higher yield. Yield-per-recruit ranged between 10 000 and 14 000 tonnes. Results should, however, be treated with caution, as the condition of steady state was not satisfied. The age-structured production model was tuned using trends in catch-per-unit-effort data, estimated by Generalised Linear Modeling, as well as relative abundance indices calculated from hake biomass surveys. The model was found to be sensitive to both the ‘steepness’ parameter h and estimates of natural mortality. The ‘depletion’ level of the monkfish resource is currently estimated to be 49 %. Estimated coefficients of variation were high (> 63 %) due to the lack of a consistent trend within the abundance indices to tune the model. Overall productivity of the monkfish resource was estimated to be approximately 16 %, similar to other southern African demersal resources. Results of the risk analyses suggest that catches in excess of 7 000 tonnes may be unsustainable and that catches of 5 000 or 6 000 tonnes would decrease the risk of stock collapse and possibly lead to a recovery in the stock. Monkfish management strategies were reviewed and these were considered in relation to the results of this study. The following management recommendations were made: to follow the precautionary approach and implement a total allowable catch for monkfish; to implement rigid sorting grids as these would be the most appropriate way in which to reduce catches of juvenile monkfish; to restrict soak time, depth of operation and implement means to reduce ‘ghost fishing’ by gillnetting and finally, to develop a management procedure for Namibian monkfish with the main objective being the sustainable exploitation of the resource...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{analysed}} the male meiosis, {{the content and}} distribution of heterochromatin and the number and location of nucleolus organizing regions in Microtomus lunifer (Berg, 1900) by means of standard technique, C- and fluorescent bandings, and fluorescent in situ hybridization with an 18 S rDNA probe. This species is the second one cytogenetically analysed within the Hammacerinae. Its male diploid chromosome number is 31 (2 n= 28 +X 1 X 2 Y), including a minute pair of m-chromosomes. The diploid autosomal number {{and the presence of}} m-chromosomes are similar to those reported in M. conspicillaris (Drury, 1782) (2 n= 28 +XY). However, M. lunifer has a multiple sex chromosome system X 1 X 2 Y (male) that could have originated by fragmentation of the ancestral X chromosome. Taking into account that M. conspicillaris and M. lunifer are the only two species within Reduviidae that possess m-chromosomes, the presence of this pair could be a synapomorphy for the species of this genus. C- and fluorescent bandings showed that the amount of heterochromatin in M. lunifer was small, and only a small CMA 3 bright band was observed in the largest autosomal pair at one <b>terminal</b> region. <b>FISH</b> with the 18 S rDNA probe demonstrated that ribosomal genes were terminally placed on the largest autosomal pair.

Color change can be artificially induced by injecting testosterone. 2) These fish are omnivorous, and feed strictly on coral polyps and algae. In feeding, they form mixed foraging groups with other scarids, mullids and labrids. Such groups are often attacked by several pomacentrid fishes, which hold territories on coral substrata within the lagoon moat. Individuals within mixed foraging groups, however, can get food from the pomacentrids 2 ̆ 7 territories by swamping. At night, these fish sleep within mucous envelops. 3) S. sordidus spawns from April to August at Kuroshima. Spawning begins immediately after high tide and continues for about one hour at reef channels or outer reef slopes. Both pair and group spawning were observed. Terminal males spawn in pairs with single females, whereas, initial males spawn in groups. ハゲブダイScarus sordidus Forsskalはインド-太平洋の浅海岩礁に広く分布し,ブダイ科魚類のうちでは全長 30 cmほどの比較的小型のもので,わが国では大隅諸島から琉球列島に生息している(Gushima and Murakami, 1976;吉野ら, 1975). Choatand Robertson(1975) はオーストラリアのヘロン島において,本種を含むブダイ類の性転換と産卵行動について研究し,本種が顕著な性的二型を示し,雌性先熟性の性転換を行うことを明らかにした. また,日本産ブダイ類については,ブダイCalotomus japonicus (Cuvier et Valenciennes) の成熟,年齢と成長および資源量(静岡県水試, 1974;河尻, 1975, 1976),ブダイ類の食性(橋本, 1977) およびブダイ類を含む磯魚の混成群の生態(具島・村上, 1979) などの研究がある. 著者らは増殖学的立場から岩礁性魚類の繁殖生態を明らかにする研究を行いつつあるが,その一環としてベラ亜目魚類の産卵行動を潜水観察するとともに,性転換について研究を行つている,今回は沖縄県八重山郡竹富町黒島で調査したハゲブダイの雌雄性と性転換,一般生態および産卵生態について報告する...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{importance}} of the relationships between the neighborhoods along the Golden Horn with the actual waterfront was the reason to explore the ways to redefine this degenerated connection. The disconnection is the result of Istanbul’s XXth century industrialization, when the city walls were demolished to construct a highway between the waterside and the neighborhoods. Through researching the organization strategies applied by the Ottomans to structure the waterfront, I propose a new urban scheme, reconnecting the network of neighborhoods with its traditional habitat – the waterfront. The scheme suggests implementing new gateways of the city (Constantinople), the bodily experiences for individuals to reconnect with the tradition of bathing – water. now The neighborhood of Balat {{is one of the oldest}} and historically most important neighborhoods of Istanbul’s old peninsula. Before realizing its historical significance, my fascination was triggered by the existent atmosphere. Secluded from the rest of the city from all sides by its urban scheme (layers of the different cities clashing, (Byzantine Constantinople, Ottomans and Turkish Republic), or natural terrain, this network of small, almost gated community-like neighborhoods practically try to burst out onto the Golden Horn. The pressure of seclusion was historically released by the openness to the waterfront and neighborhoods still reach out to restore the balance, destroyed by the segregation due to the construction of the highway, and faceless waterfront. then Looking back in time, the waterfront of the Golden Horn used to be a fruitful industrial and recreational area, organized by the Ottomans in a fashion related to the waterfront. The layers of functions are organized perpendicular, going from neighborhoods, through gateways (through walls) to the waterfront and finally to the actual body of water. Here, gateways enable transition between in (neighborhood, residence, private) and out (waterfront, industrial, recreational, public). method Choosing the site of Balat as a case study for all Golden Horn waterfront neighborhoods, I suggest an urban scheme based on the genealogy of the use of the waterfronts for centuries, altering on a spectrum of recreation, trade, industry and logistics. Green strips of recreational functions (further referred to as the plots) are arranged perpendicular to the water. The precise function depends on the immediate needs of a neighborhood; the width depends on the function. To release pressure from the city, the scheme proposes mitigation points: new gateways, transporting from neighborhoods - in, to the waterfronts - out. new gateways purpose New gateways are the built extrusions of the plots. Their main purpose is providing the experience for transitioning the body to the water. function Their function is merely related to the bodily and mental experience of the water. Like: swimming pool, bathhouse, ferry <b>terminal,</b> <b>fish</b> market, scuba diving or canoeing school, aquarium, cisterns 8 ̆ 5 The function for the case study is an aquatic center, complex of swimming pools and diverse bathing experiences. in and out The building repeats the characteristics of the gateways. It is composed of walls and inbetween open spaces. Transition between these walls and open spaces explores further the coexistence of public and private, open and close, in and out, tradition and modern. The walls accommodate the private, mostly closed traditional functions; they house hammam, private bathes, massage therapies and changing rooms. The visitors are segregated either by gender (hammam, changing rooms), or choice (massage therapy, balneotherapy). The atmosphere here is secure, calm and dimmed, a bodily experience - sheltered. Outside, the walls are surrounded by open, public, modern functions; here men, women and children bath under the sun together. Lazy sunbathers lay on the grass, lively kids slide or play with the shallow pool water. Water reflects the sunlight; the atmosphere is - exposed. material The walls are the gates (from public to private, tradition to modern, open to close 8 ̆ 5) within the gateway (built extrusion of the plot), reminiscent of Constantinople’s city walls; they wrap themselves with limestone, exposing their real (true) nature (poured concrete) only where it’s been carved out (portals). Conclusion The project can be read as a conceptual fractal system. On each scale, starting from the urban scheme up to the materialization, the theme of gateways—transition from one state to another, related to the bodily experience—is attempted. The aim was to create contrasting spaces, located in proximity of each other, and lead visitor from one to another thru architecture, by exposing to the somewhat preview of what awaits, drawing to explore and go further.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is a bibliographic {{revision}} of longliner fisheries off south and southeast Brazil. The yield, effort and CPUE data of the main species, like tuna, shark and swordfish, from Santos longliner catches in the 1971 - 2001 period, are also included. Some people were interviewed, using the human memory in order to complement the information related to different results of this analysis. The importance of the <b>Fishing</b> <b>Terminal,</b> and its history, shows the great value of "Baixada Santista " for the tuna fisheries in the studied region, as well as the fisheries in a general way. In the studied period, comprising 30 years, the analysis was done by decades. In the 70 s the tuna yield was the highest, comprising three main species: yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). It has decreased dramatically in the following decades. In those years there was an advance in the fishery strategy, including the choice of better fishing areas and the use of more sophisticated equipment. All these changes stimulated the exportation of these species. In the 80 s the shark yield was the highest, specially the blue shark (Prionace glauca). It was followed by new ways of commercialization and a raise in the commercial value of the fins. In the 90 s, and also in 2000 and 2001, the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) was the most importan...|$|R

The estimated total yearly kills (1988 / 1989) at this port are 2, 289 (SE= 130) and 2, 320 (SE= 117) animals, including 1, 725 / 1, 893 dusky dolphins, 383 / 331 Burmeister's porpoises, 155 / 57 common dolphins, 18 / 31 bottlenose dolphins and 8 / 8 specimens of other species. With few exceptions, {{the animals were}} captured incidentally or directly in gillnets in a multispecies artisanal fishery (only about twelve animals were seen with harpoon wounds). The total kill at Pucusana in 1989 had increased roughly {{by a factor of}} three compared to 1986 levels and tenfold compared to 1985. A shift was observed in seasonality of peak landings of dusky and common dolphins. Catch estimates for another port, Cerro Azul (13 ° 00 ’S), are 68 (SE= 17) dolphins and porpoises in December 1987 and 131 (SE= 47) in July 1988. Analysis of statistics provided by the Ministry of Fisheries (MIPE) suggest a steady decline in small cetacean catches for the entire coast of Peru, from an estimated 9, 700 animals (756 metric tonnes) in 1985 to 5, 500 (426 metric tonnes) in 1988; {{the reason for this is}} unknown since the trend in artisanal fishing effort associated with cetacean mortality cannot be deduced from existing data.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} myxosporean parasite Enteromyxum leei causes severe desquamative enteritis in gilthead {{sea bream}} (Sparus aurata) (Teleostei) that impairs nutrient absorption causing anorexia and cachexia. In fish, as in terrestrial vertebrates, intestinal goblet cells {{are responsible for}} the adherent mucus secretion overlying epithelial cells, which constitutes a first line of innate immune defense against offending microorganisms but serves also as substrate and nutrient source for the commensal microflora. The secreted intestinal mucus of parasitized (n = 6) and unexposed (n = 8) gilthead sea bream was isolated, concentrated, and subjected to downward gel chromatography. Carbohydrate and protein contents (via PAS and Bradford stainings), terminal glycosylation (via lectin ELISA), and Aeromonas hydrophila and Vibrio alginolyticus adhesion were analyzed for the isolated intestinal mucins. Parasitized fish, compared with unexposed fish, presented intestinal mucus mucins with a lower glycoprotein content and glycosylation degree at the anterior and middle intestine, whereas both glycoprotein content and glycosylation degree increased at the posterior intestine section, though only significantly for the total carbohydrate content. Additionally, a slight molecular size increase was detected in the mucin glycoproteins of parasitized <b>fish.</b> <b>Terminal</b> glycosylation of the mucus glycoproteins in parasitized fish pointed to an immature mucin secretion (N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine increase, α-l-fucose, and neuraminic-acid-α- 2 - 6 -galactose reduction). Bacterial adhesion to large-sized mucus glycoproteins (> 2, 000 kDa) of parasitized fish was significantly lower than in unexposed fish. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
