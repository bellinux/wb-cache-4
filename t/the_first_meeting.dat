40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study is to explore how {{teachers}} in Early Childhood Education programs(ECE) in Sweden describe and relate to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with migrant children and theirfamilies. The research questions are; how do teachers describe <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with themigrant children and their families? and what kind of difficulties can we distinguish from theteachers’ descriptions? Our essay will answer these questions by analyzing data gatheredthrough a focus group of four teachers. This study has a qualitative approach and the teachersdescriptions are interpreted and analyzed with a postmodern and socially constructive view oninteraction and meeting the Other. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with <b>the</b> immigrant families contain information andquestions of a practical nature. The results also show difficulties during these <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> andthe continuous work with the migrant children and their families due to language barriers. Twothemes are also noticeable in our results: the teachers ambition and dedication and the teachersfeelings of being insufficient. In conclusion our results show that it’s not always easy workingwith immigrant families. Some of the contributing factors to this are inadequate resources, thelack of time and the large groups of children in the Swedish ECE programs.

5|$|Linfield's main rivals are Glentoran {{from east}} Belfast – a rivalry which is {{commonly}} known as Belfast's Big Two. However, this term did not always refer to Linfield and Glentoran. Up until 1949, the Big Two consisted of Linfield and Belfast Celtic, as they had traditionally been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to that point. However, after Belfast Celtic withdrew from the league in 1949, Glentoran gradually established themselves as Linfield's biggest rivals. The earliest recorded match between the two clubs was played on 1 October 1887 – just over a year after Linfield's formation. A friendly match played at King's Field, Westbourne in Ballymacarrett was won 3–1 by Linfield (then known as Linfield Athletic). In 1890, the two teams played each other competitively for the first time, during the inaugural Irish League season. Linfield won 7–0 at Musgrave Park on 18 October, and 6–0 at Ulsterville Avenue on 21 March 1891. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>meeting</b> at the Oval took place on 8 October 1892, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>meeting</b> at Windsor Park took place 13 years later on 2 September 1905.|$|E
