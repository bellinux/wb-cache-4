2500|$|While at Fort Myer, Virginia Emory {{acted as}} a {{correspondent}} for the Baltimore Sun. His series of five articles, entitled [...] "Reports from a Rookie" [...] and carrying his byline, appeared {{from time to time in}} the Sun, and explained many details of camp life and the rigors of military training of the day. In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated what it would mean for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of being an American when he glances about and <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor Altoum, {{father of}} Turandot, {{sits on his}} grand throne in his palace. Weary of having to judge his {{isolated}} daughter's sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria – Altoum, the Prince: Un giuramento atroce – [...] "An atrocious oath"). Turandot enters and explains (In questa reggia – [...] "In this palace") that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom [...] "in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men" [...] until she was ravished and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her, and out of revenge, Turandot has sworn to never let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: Straniero, ascolta! – [...] "What is born each night and dies each dawn?" [...] The Prince correctly replies, Speranza – [...] "Hope." [...] The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (Guizza al pari di fiamma – [...] "What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?") The Prince <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before replying, Sangue – [...] "Blood". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (Gelo che ti da foco – [...] "What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?"). As the prince thinks, Turandot taunts him, [...] "What is the ice that makes you burn?" [...] The taunt makes him see the answer and he proclaims, [...] "It is Turandot! Turandot!" ...|$|E

It is God he wants, and the light of God's countenance, without which he cannot live, and leaving him in misery, and shame, and darkness, {{and out of the}} darkness he cries--My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

5000|$|From the {{demanding}} study of raga music, Manose has acquired technical mastery and an astonishing ability to improvise.

They trudge home, and the next day, Linus visits Charlie Brown. Sally tells him her brother has been in his room all day with the shades down and refuses to see or talk to anybody. Linus tells Charlie Brown that the other kids missed him at school and that his {{baseball}} team finally got their first win of the season, but Charlie Brown says he will never return to school again. As Linus leaves, {{he points out that}} the world did not end despite Charlie Brown's failure. Charlie Brown <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> gets dressed, and goes outside. He sees the other children playing, and when he spots Lucy as she plays with a football which is the same one he failed to kick earlier, he sneaks up behind her to kick it. She pulls it away before he can, and welcomes him home and the two look at the audience before the screen fades out.|$|E

50|$|The {{first chapter}} begins with Sylvester (R. Kelly) waking up at around 7:00 {{in the morning}} in another person's bed. Sylvester realizes when he wakes up that another woman who is not his wife {{approaches}} him and kisses him. After scolding himself for committing infidelity, he puts on the rest of his clothes and grabs his car keys and prepares to make his way home when the woman comes back, stopping him from moving, telling him her husband is coming up the stairs. She insists Sylvester hide in the closet but Sylvester insists on jumping out of a window. When the woman reminds him they are on the fifth floor, Sylvester <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and agrees to hide in the closet. As soon after that, her husband walks in and she lies to him, which gets Sylvester to think she should win an Oscar for her acting. They then began making love in the bed when Sylvester's cell phone goes off. Sylvester tries to put it on vibrate but the husband starts suspecting something is up and goes to investigate. After searching through a shower curtain, under the bed and even the dresser, he slowly approaches the closet. Sylvester takes his gun out in preparation. The chapter ends with the husband opening the closet.|$|E

She later performs for her home crowd, and Morris, in a last attempt to get Isabel for himself, sends Ted to kill [...] "First Eric, then myself," [...] as he constantly repeats under his spell. However, before Ted becomes a ghoul, he is able to write a letter to Isabel that explains what happened to him and who did all of the killings. Plus, he exposes Morris to the gas just before he reverts to his ghoul state, and leaves to fulfill Morris's final bidding. Upon entering the stage where Isabel is, he is promptly dispatched by detectives, just as he is about to shoot Eric, who read the note to Isabel that Ted left in his hands. She and Eric hold each other, knowing that Ted always intended the best for them, and that Morris was behind all of the trouble with which Ted and many others were involved.|$|E

While saving Dhaani, Viplav gets {{a head injury}} and falls unconscious. Dhaani saves him and gets them to a house where a lady lets them stay until Viplav gets better. Dhaani lies to the lady and says they are married to avoid getting kicked out. They spend {{multiple}} days there, and Viplav {{falls in love with}} Dhaani, and is about to confess his love but Tripurari and his goons catch Dhaani and bring her back to Banaras. The people in Banaras try to kill Dhaani seeing her in colored clothers, but Viplav reaches there in time and saves her. He confesses his love for her in front of the crowd, and threatens them against ever trying to hurt her, as she is his future wife. Dhaani gets very confused, and talks to him about his declaration. She doesn't accept his proposal, and says she only views him as a good friend. Viplav doesn't back down, and pretends to be taking a flight to US. Dhaani realizes her love and runs after him, and <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that she has lost him forever.

5000|$|In this pre-show room, {{just before}} the ride, Gru, along with some Minions, enter the room and {{explains}} the public are there for a reason: henching for the world's #1 supervillain. Gru explains his plan of turning everyday ordinary human beings into Minions using a kind of device, called the Minion Gun, created by Doctor Nefario. Next, the whole audience is given a routine body scan {{to make sure there}} are not any [...] "human germs" [...] in the lab by using high-density lasers. However, the scan ends up with a warning: Gru gets disappointed when that some of the guests [...] "have not showered in like a week". Lucky for the audience, Gru is {{in a bit of a}} time crunch and warns for the rest of the audience that he will hit them with his [...] "Pistola de pedo" [...] (Spanish for [...] "fart gun") if any are thinking on backing out. However, at the same moment, the girls show up, and Gru explains to the audience to ignore them. Agnes and Margo start to explain to the audience that they should not be scared of Gru by calling him [...] "just a big, bald teddy bear". Afterwards, Agnes wants to give a present to Gru. He loves to accept it, but tells her to wait, explaining that he is going to be really behind schedule; also, he has to train the public who are on the verge of becoming Minions. Margo eagerly asks Gru if the trio can assist him by training the crowd: Gru <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> but responds with: [...] "I do not think so." [...] However, as Edith starts begging, Gru says that the training is very technical. It all becomes clear when Edith explains that her foster father has been reluctant for a while, not wanting to accept his daughters' willings. When Margo and Edith finally explain to Gru, who is busy shooing the Minions holding fire-works away, that the Minion training is [...] "not like it's rocket science, or even fourth grade science" [...] and that [...] "a training monkey can do it," [...] he agrees irate, calmly explaining to the audience that he will leave his daughters in charge of the training. Once Edith hears this, she explains to the guests that they [...] "are so doomed." [...] Gru, however, orders the public to not listen to her, despite him saying that Edith might be right for once. He leaves the room and wishes the guests good luck, at exactly the same time Agnes attempts to catch up with him to give him her anniversary gift of the girls adoption. Edith, however, explains to her younger sibling that Gru already left, which made Agnes filled with sorrow, realizing that Gru may have forgotten the anniversary of their adoption. Margo says to her that he will not, and that also they have an important job to do: training the audience into Minions for Gru's bidding. Margo's determination to initiate the training causes Edith to be pumped up and say: [...] "Let's do this!". After that, the doors to the ride are opened, the public is let through and Margo instructs to the audience to not put on their minion goggles until they are told to do so by a lab assistant.|$|E
