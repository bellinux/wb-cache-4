5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry.

The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>but</b> distinguished the names of the degrees from those of male masonry.|$|E
