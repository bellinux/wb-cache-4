5|$|More Jews {{came from}} Bukhara, Persia, and, {{following}} the Farhud pogrom in Iraq in 1941, many more immigrants shifted to Bombay. They all used to assemble in <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> Eliyahoo synagogue {{in large numbers}} during festival days and on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. On many such occasions, {{in view of the}} large crowd of devotees, overflow prayer services were held in the neighbouring Cawasjee Jehangir Public Hall.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knesset</b> Eliyahoo, also Knesset Eliyahu, is an Orthodox Jewish synagogue {{located in}} {{downtown}} Mumbai, India. It is the city's second oldest Sephardic synagogue. It {{was established in}} 1884 by Jacob Elias Sassoon, son of Eliyahoo David Sassoon and grandson of David Sassoon; the latter had immigrated from Baghdad to India in 1832 due to persecution and had settled in Mumbai, then known as Bombay. It is maintained by the Jacob Sassoon Trust. The building's significance is attributed to its Jewish traditions as well as Indian and English colonial influences.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever {{terrorist}} attack on Jews in Mumbai occurred on 26 November 2008. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who had conducted Sabbath services on the previous day and also held religious discourses at <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> Eliyahoo, was killed, {{along with his wife}} and a few other Jews at the Nariman House, a community center operated by Chabad. This sowed fear among the Jewish community members residing in Mumbai, and also forged a closer bond between the city's Baghdadi and Bene Israel Jews.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> second <b>Knesset,</b> <b>the</b> third <b>Knesset</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} stable in Israel's history. There were only two governments, and it was <b>the</b> only <b>Knesset</b> to date during which none of the parties split or merged. As with the first and second <b>Knesset,</b> <b>the</b> speaker was Yosef Sprinzak until his death on 28 January 1959. He was {{replaced}} by Ahdut HaAvoda's Nahum Nir.|$|R

5|$|Today, Haifa {{is governed}} by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Yona Yahav. The results of {{municipal}} elections decide on {{the makeup of the}} council, similarly to <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui-Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.|$|E

His opponents then backed Peres in the second round and 86 members of <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> voted in his favor, while 23 objected. He {{resigned}} from his role as a Member of <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> the same day, having been a member since November 1959 (except for a three-month period in early 2006), the longest serving in Israeli political history.

25|$|Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to {{recognize}} foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, however this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights; Israel {{does not recognize}} civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in <b>the</b> <b>Knesset,</b> 39–11, on 16 May 2012.|$|E
25|$|Yizhar {{was elected}} to the first Knesset in 1949, {{remaining}} a Knesset member until the 1955 elections.

In 1965 he defected to David Ben-Gurion's new Rafi party, but resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> on 20 February 1967.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Third <b>Knesset</b> {{is notable}} for being <b>the</b> only <b>Knesset</b> thus far in which {{none of the}} {{represented}} parties merged or split (although two parties did change their names) and no MKs switched parties, making it <b>the</b> most stable <b>Knesset</b> in Israel's history.|$|R

25|$|From 2001 to 2009, Livni {{served in}} the {{cabinets}} of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert, most notably as Israel's Foreign Minister, during which time she led multiple rounds of peace talks with the Palestinians. In September 2008, Livni prepared to take office as Prime Minister of Israel, but the political climate in the country prevented her from forming a government. The following year, she led her party to win a plurality of seats in <b>the</b> <b>Knesset,</b> but was again blocked from becoming prime minister, due to the rightist parties' majority in <b>the</b> <b>Knesset.</b> Consequently, she served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009, until her resignation from <b>the</b> <b>Knesset</b> in 2012.|$|E

50|$|In 1950, <b>the</b> first <b>Knesset</b> came to {{what was}} called the Harari Decision.

Each chapter would be called a Basic Law, and when all had been written they would be compiled into a complete constitution.|$|R
50|$|The only {{long-lasting}} {{faction of}} the collapse was Shinui, which reappeared in <b>the</b> next <b>Knesset,</b> <b>the</b> only party emerging from Dash to do so.
