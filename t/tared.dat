5000|$|Loss on {{ignition}} {{is a test}} used in inorganic analytical chemistry, {{particularly in}} the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances to escape, until its mass ceases to change. This may be done in air, or in some other reactive or inert atmosphere. The simple test typically consists of placing a few grams of the material in a <b>tared,</b> pre-ignited crucible and determining its mass, placing it in a temperature-controlled furnace for a set time, cooling it in a controlled (e.g. water-free, CO2-free) atmosphere, and redetermining the mass. The process may be repeated to show that mass-change is complete. A variant of the test in which mass-change is continually monitored as temperature is changed, is thermogravimetry.|$|E

5000|$|On 25 June 2015 Mahao {{left his}} farm in Mokema with two nephews. According to the nephew's {{testimony}} {{and a letter}} written by Mahao's family to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other African leaders, his car was chased and stopped by three military vehicles. A group of men, including one dressed as a soldier, carrying AK-47 rifles shot at Mahao from the driver's side of the his truck. The boys opened the passenger door but were suddenly stopped by soldiers. In the meantime, Lt. Gen. Mahao fell out of his truck through the open passenger door left open by his nephews. Soldiers then came around and dragged his bleeding body by his feet, face-down on <b>tared</b> road and threw it into one of their trucks. Two vehicles drove off, while the third one stayed behind with the nephews. The two boys were held by soldiers who remained behind for approximately 40 minutes before they were released. One of the soldiers asked one of Mahao's nephews who they were {{and what they were}} doing with him. The nephew told the soldier that he was a student in a university in South Africa, and had come home for winter holidays. The soldier replied, [...] "U tlo lija ha bohloko he?!", meaning the nephew was not going to enjoy the holidays. In the meantime, the soldier had made a call with his mobile phone, apparently reporting to his sender that [...] "Re mo thuntse!", meaning they (soldiers) had shot Lt. Gen. Mahao. The soldier also mentioned on the phone that they were with a particular Sergeant. The soldiers then gave the boys an option to either return to Lt. Gen. Mahao's home and narrate what they had witnessed to Lt. Gen. Mahao's mother, or go to Maseru to report to his wife. The boys opted to go to Maseru. Driving the bloody truck with broken windows, the remaining army truck drove the opposite direction, only {{to catch up with the}} boys shortly after, finding them on the roadside standing outside the truck, fearing a possibility of explosives in the truck.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is discussed {{that may be}} used to estimate <b>tare</b> loads of wind tunnel strain-gage balance calibration data. The algorithm was originally developed by R. Galway of IAR/NRC Canada and has been described in the literature for the iterative analysis technique. Basic ideas of Galway's algorithm, however, are universally applicable and work for both the iterative and the non-iterative analysis technique. A recent modification of Galway's {{algorithm is}} presented that improves the convergence behavior of the <b>tare</b> load prediction process if it is used in combination with the non-iterative analysis technique. The modified algorithm allows an analyst to use an alternate method for the calculation of intermediate non-linear <b>tare</b> load estimates whenever Galway's original approach does not lead to a convergence of the <b>tare</b> load iterations. It is also shown in detail how Galway's algorithm may be applied to the non-iterative analysis technique. Hand load data from the calibration of a six-component force balance is used to illustrate the application of the original and modified <b>tare</b> load prediction method. During the analysis of the data both the iterative and the non-iterative analysis technique were applied. Overall, predicted <b>tare</b> loads for combinations of the two <b>tare</b> load prediction methods and the two balance data analysis techniques showed excellent agreement as long as the <b>tare</b> load iterations converged. The modified algorithm, however, appears to have an advantage over the original algorithm when absolute voltage measurements of gage outputs are processed using the non-iterative analysis technique. In these situations only the modified algorithm converged because it uses an exact solution of the intermediate non-linear <b>tare</b> load estimate for the <b>tare</b> load iteration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{perform a}} {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis comparing {{the use of}} transarterial radioembolization (<b>TARE)</b> with that of sorafenib {{in the treatment of}} patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. MethodsPatient-level data were consecutively recorded and collected at three oncology centers in Italy. A propensity score matching was performed to compare patients with similar clinical characteristics who underwent <b>TARE</b> or sorafenib treatment. Clinical data from the matched cohorts were used to populate a Markov model to project, on a lifetime horizon, life years, quality-adjusted life years, and economic outcomes associated with <b>TARE</b> and sorafenib for both intermediate and advanced HCC stages. ResultsStarting from data covering 389 and 241 patients who underwent <b>TARE</b> and sorafenib treatment, respectively, the propensity score matching yielded a total of 308 matched patients. For intermediate-stage patients, the model estimated for <b>TARE</b> versus sorafenib an incremental cost-utility ratio of € 3, 302 /QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 1, 865 per life year gained), whereas for patients in advanced stage <b>TARE</b> dominated (lower costs and greater health improvements) compared with sorafenib. ConclusionsFrom an Italian health care service perspective, <b>TARE</b> could be a cost-effective strategy in comparison with sorafenib for patients with intermediate or advanced HCC. The results from forthcoming randomized controlled trials comparing <b>TARE</b> with sorafenib will be able to confirm or reject the validity of this preliminary evaluation.
