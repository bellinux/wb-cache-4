5|$|After hearing Sunny on the radio, Robin Hester {{turns up}} in Ramsay Street {{to try to}} get close to her. Sunny {{believes}} he is just being friendly. Robin climbs through Sunny's bedroom window and takes a photo of her. He locks Zeke in Pirate Net's storeroom, so he can spend some time with Sunny alone. Sunny and Robin go to Pirate Net to see if Zeke is there and Robin pretends to find <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> key and unlocks the door. Zeke tells Sunny that Robin locked him in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> but she refuses to believe him. Zeke violently attacks Robin in front of Sunny, scaring her. Zeke apologises and Sunny eventually realises that Zeke had been right about Robin. Sunny meets Robin at Charlie's and tells him that she and Zeke have broken up. Robin confesses to locking Zeke in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> and tries to kiss Sunny, but Zeke appears and tells Robin to stay away them.|$|E
5|$|Nick Dalton, an {{attorney}} and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, and goes to <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck {{with the heel of}} her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate {{and he had no}} motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1993, The National Museum was {{destroyed}} by several rockets that penetrated the roof, top floor {{and most of the}} building doors and windows. Shortly thereafter it was looted where more than four thousand objects deposited in <b>the</b> <b>storerooms</b> of <b>the</b> museum for safe keeping were stolen. Nearby, the Institute of Archaeology was also severely damaged.

25|$|Marshall's initial senior {{appearance}} was a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy (List A) match for Barbados on 13 February 1978; again {{he made a}} duck and did not take a wicket. Four days later, he made his first-class debut against Jamaica, and whilst he failed to score runs, he claimed 6–77 in the Jamaican first innings. On {{the back of this}} single first-class appearance he was selected to tour India in 1978/79, many first-choice West Indian stars being unavailable having committed themselves to playing World Series Cricket. Marshall heard of his selection on the radio while working in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> at Banks Brewery and later claimed he did not know where India was.|$|E
500|$|Tintin is {{informed}} by Thomson and Thompson of a case involving the ramblings of a drunken man, later killed, found with {{a scrap of paper}} from {{what appears to be a}} tin of crab meat with the word [...] "Karaboudjan" [...] scrawled on it. His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a Japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the Karaboudjan, where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and Tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food, leaving the man bound and gagged in the room. Tintin encounters Captain Haddock, an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew's criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats Jumbo, the sailor left in the cabin, while Allan thinks Tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into <b>the</b> <b>storeroom.</b> He blows open <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> door, then finding it empty goes back to the Captain's room, where he finds Jumbo tied to a chair and gagged. Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them. Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the Sahara, where the crew escapes.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom.</b>|$|E

Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas {{to have a look}} at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest of this stuff is stayin' put for who knows how long, but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the bit from [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the good Lord shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, the Ritz became {{integral}} to {{political and social}} life among the elite, {{and a number of}} eminent royals, aristocrats and politicians moved into the hotel. Camilla Russell, the wife of writer Christopher Sykes, stated that the Ritz [...] "enjoyed a tremendous vogue during the war and was, even more than ever, much used as a meeting place", and at night was [...] "crowded yet somehow safe". Angela, Countess of Antrim, Syke's sister, remarked that the Ritz was the ideal meeting place for [...] "gathering news of husbands at the wars". Emerald Cunard took up residence in the Ritz for a period, but later moved to the Dorchester. In the summer of 1940, the Albanian royal family, including King Zog I, Queen Geraldine, Crown Prince Leka, the King's six sisters, two nieces, three nephews and others moved into the hotel and were given their own floor, escorted by Chamberlain, the Albanian diplomats from Paris, and numerous bodyguards. Zog brought the royal gold and jewels with him, which were kept in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> of the Ritz before being deposited in the Bank of England.|$|E

5000|$|Foreign loanwords were {{especially}} reviled. As Korais had written, [...] "To borrow from foreigners—or, to speak more clearly, to beg words and phrases, with which <b>the</b> <b>storerooms</b> of ones language are already replete—creates {{a reputation for}} complete ignorance or even idiocy as well as dishonour." ...|$|R
5000|$|From the {{physical}} point of view, {{at least for}} these multi-ton pithoi, J. L. Stokes' view that they were [...] "unmoveable furniture, being in general, either wholly or partially sunk in the ground", is most likely accurate. Currently at Knossos some empty pithoi have been placed standing in passageways, {{such as those of}} <b>the</b> <b>storerooms.</b> This is a convention of display. Apart from the fact that they would seriously have impeded the dimly-lit corridors, {{there would have been no}} way to access them except by scaffold. They must have been originally placed in the pits of <b>the</b> <b>storerooms,</b> except possibly for the smaller and more easily accessed ones. There is also a question of stability. Only some were of a stable barrel-shape.|$|R

They both came, and the ship headed for Guam on 11 January, and arrived on 26 January, debarking troops. After a very short stay in Guam, orders arrived {{for a return to}} San Francisco. There it was learned that Neshoba would be put out of active service on 13 March. With a new paint job, sealing of guns, compartments and everything ready for <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> Neshoba, commonly known as the [...] "Mighty N", left Mare Island for Stockton, California. She was to be a [...] "mother ship" [...] for five other ships tied together.|$|E

The [...] statue is made of wood from India, ivory and mother of pearl. The Guardian was made by Indian labourers who {{constructed}} the Istana and was presented to Sir Shenton Thomas to commemorate his taking up of residence there. During the Second World War, the statue was placed in a storeroom. It was forgotten until 1995 when Istana guards were tasked to clear <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> at which time it was found lying next to the British coat of arms which used to hang at the main entrance to the Istana.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans {{considered}} the Penates as the gods {{to whom they}} owed their own existence. As noted by Wissowa Penates is an adjective, meaning [...] "those of or from the penus" [...] the innermost part, most hidden recess; Dumézil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of penus as <b>the</b> <b>storeroom</b> of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the Penates publici: Dionysius calls them Trojan gods as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome {{at the foot of}} the Velian Hill, near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at Lavinium, because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.|$|E

2500|$|Within this structure, {{the main}} {{entrance}} opens to a small vestibule. The vestibule in itself is a section of a 12 x 1 meter long corridor {{which led to the}} keeper's quarters. The entrance to the tower, which has a 3.9 meter square base located {{in the center of the}} structure, is across {{the main entrance}}. On both sides of the tower base there were two 4.74m x 4.55m rooms one which served as the engineer's room and the other as a storeroom. North of the tower base the oil room was located. This one measures 3.6m x 1.5m. [...] Therefore, from west to east a structural connection is formed by <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> towers' base, oil room, engineer's room, and the corridor. This section links the keeper's quarters. These were arranged into two parallel sections running north to south and oriented of identical dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|Towards evening a hawker named Gloster camped, as usual, at the station.

[...] Kelly looked up and said, [...] "What is that you say?" [...] Gloster, without waiting to give an explanation, rushed towards the wagon, and Kelly and Joe Byrne {{followed}}. McCauley was worried for the safety of Gloster and followed them. Upon reaching his wagon, the hawker searched for his revolver, but was [...] "covered" [...] by the bushrangers, and McCauley threatened, [...] "Look out Gloster, you will be shot", at the same time appealing to Kelly not to shoot him. Gloster turned and said, [...] "Who are you?" [...] Kelly replied, [...] "I am Ned Kelly, son of Red Kelly, as good a blood as any in the land, and for two pins I would put a match to your wagon and burn it." [...] The stationhands, Gloster, and Beecroft were all placed in <b>the</b> <b>storeroom,</b> under guard. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air. Time passed quietly until two o'clock in the morning, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Steve Hart and Joe Byrne rushed from the building. [...] McCauley was surrounded by the bushrangers and Kelly said, [...] "You are armed, we have found a lot of ammunition in the house." [...] After this episode the outlaws retired to sleep.|$|E
