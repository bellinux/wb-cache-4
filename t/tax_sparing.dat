50|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>sparing</b> {{refers to}} {{granting}} a home country foreign {{tax credit for}} specific foreign taxes {{that would have been}} payable but for tax exemption in the foreign country. The concept of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> was once fairly widespread, but has been reconsidered by many countries. The apparent intent of the provisions was for developed nations to provide economic incentives for enterprises in such nations to invest in developing nations. Under the Germany/Indonesia tax treaty of 1977 (a typical provision), Germany allowed a credit with respect to dividends, interest and royalties for Indonesian taxes that would have been paid but for the provisions of Indonesian law designed to promote economic development in Indonesia.|$|E

For systems that separately tax business entities and their members, a deemed paid credit may be offered to entities receiving income (such as dividends) from other entities, with respect to taxes paid by the payor entities {{with respect to the}} income underlying the income recognized by the member. Systems with controlled foreign corporation rules may provide deemed paid credits with respect to deemed income inclusions under such rules. Some variations on the credit provide for a credit for hypothetical tax to encourage foreign investment (sometimes known as <b>tax</b> <b>sparing).</b>|$|E

The main purpose of these treaties is the avoidance of double taxation on income earned {{in any of these}} countries. Under these agreements, a credit is usually allowed against the tax levied by the country in which the taxpayer resides for taxes levied in the other treaty country and as a result the tax payer pays no more than the higher of the two rates. Further, some treaties provide for <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> credits whereby the tax credit allowed is not only with respect to tax actually paid in the other treaty country but also from tax which would have been otherwise payable {{had it not been for}} incentive measures in that other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax.|$|E

Special attention is paid to the economic in°uence of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> because the OECD proposal to reconsider the inclusion of this provision in bilateral tax treaties is highly controversial. An empirical analysis is proposed in order to apprehend the effects of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> on both credit and exempt investors, since they do not benefit from the same advantages provided by <b>tax</b> <b>sparing.</b> Using data from 54 developing countries over the 1990 - 2000, and distinguishing Japanese credit investors from French exempt investors, we first find that the asymmetrical sensitivity between exempt and credit investors relative to foreign corporate taxes is considerably reduced with tax measures accounting for <b>tax</b> <b>sparing.</b> Second, we find that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions have a favorable impact on the location choices of credit investors and have no influence on the location choices of exempt investors. Third, the non-robust significance of both a <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> adjusted effective interest tax rate and effective royalties tax rate tends to suggest that tax incentives on passive incomes are not really considered by both credit and exempt investors when making the decision of where to invest. foreign direct investment, <b>tax</b> <b>sparing,</b> credit and exempt tax systems, corporate taxes, interest and royalty taxes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>sparing</b> {{occurs when}} {{a country with a}} {{worldwide}} tax system grants its citizens foreign tax credits for the taxes that they would have paid on income earned abroad, but that escapes taxation by virtue of foreign tax incentives. The supporters of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> argue that it is a form of foreign aid, an obligation owed to developing countries, and a legitimate means of improving the competitiveness of resident investors. <b>Tax</b> <b>sparing,</b> however, has long been opposed by the United States {{on the grounds that it}} is an expensive and problematic concession to developing countries, inconsistent with basic and fundamental tax principles, and an inappropriate mechanism for improving the competitiveness of resident investors. The U. S. position appears to be carrying the day as <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> has been on the wane. In contrast with the emerging consensus, I offer a new argument for <b>tax</b> <b>sparing.</b> Drawing on the literature on implicit taxes, I argue that tax incentives produce implicit taxes. From the perspective of the investor, implicit taxes are as real as traditional explicit taxes. Thus, <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> is best viewed as extending the foreign tax credit to include implicit taxes. Accordingly, I argue that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> is consistent with the notion of a single level of taxation and the foreign tax credit. I also argue that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> is necessary to prevent domestic investors from being disadvantaged by foreign tax incentives. In addition, I show that such arguments support a greatly expanded form of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing.</b> Finally, I demonstrate that the <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> credit, as currently calculated, will usually exceed the implicit tax paid and propose an alternative method of calculating the credit that will place investors residing in countries with worldwide tax systems on par with other investors...|$|E

40|$|The {{governments of}} many {{developing}} countries seek to attract inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) {{through the use of}} tax incentives for multinational corporations (MNCs). The effectiveness of these tax incentives depends crucially on MNCs ’ residence country tax regime, especially where the residence country imposes worldwide taxation on foreign income. <b>Tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions are included in many bilateral tax treaties to prevent host country tax incentives being nullified by residence country taxation. We analyse the impact of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions using panel data on bilateral FDI stocks from 23 OECD countries in 113 developing and transition economies over the period 2002 - 2012 (with 8189 observations on 1103 country pairs), coding <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions in all bilateral tax treaties among these countries. We find that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> agreements are associated with a 30 percent increase in bilateral FDI stocks. The estimated effect is concentrated in the year that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> comes into force and the subsequent years, with no effects in prior years, and is thus consistent with a causal interpretation. Four countries- Norway in 2004, and the U. K., Japan, and New Zealand in 2009 - enacted tax reforms that moved them from worldwide to territorial taxation, potentially changing the value of their preexisting <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> agreements. However, there is no detectable effect of these reforms on bilateral FDI in <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> countries, relative to nonsparing countries. These results are consistent with <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> being an important determinant of FDI in developing countries for MNCs from both worldwide and territorial home countries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> agreements on Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) distribution in developing countries. These agreements are sometimes concluded between a developed country and a developing country which grants fiscal incentives to foreign investors. In that case, the former agrees not to tax its outward investors in order that the host country fiscal advantage is not compensated for by the increase in its own income taxes. Apart from the United States, the majority of developed countries have included these <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions in their fiscal bilateral treaties with developing countries. Their impacts are observed {{on the distribution of}} Japanese FDI outflows and average size of capital transaction, on the Japanese firm sales and employment {{as well as on the}} difference between the Japanese and U. S. FDI shares, over the 1989 - 2000 period. The empirical results suggest that each additional year, subsequent to the signature of a <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> agreement, increases Japanese FDI activity by 1. 7 - 11 %. These findings are robust to the use of an instrumental variable specification and give empirical support to the debate on the exclusion or not of these provisions under the bilateral tax treaty. Thus, this study confirms that <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> agreements can be useful instruments to increase the attractiveness of a developing country.

40|$|According to {{the foreign}} direct {{investment}} (FDI) literature, the elasticities between FDI and its determinants vary considerably {{with the level of}} host country development. This may be a major concern when dealing with the influence of corporate tax rates on FDI in developing countries, since most studies concentrate on developed countries. Using data on Japanese firm location choices between 1990 and 2000, we contrast differences in regional tax rates in order to reveal an asymmetry between developed and developing countries. By looking at the interaction effects between Japan and host developing countries' tax systems, we also put forward the idea that special <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> provisions signed with Japan can alter the effect of host country taxes on Japanese firms' location choices. Finally, we find that even though tax competition can be strong in developing countries, this competition should not lead to an effective rate of zero taxation for these countries in their competition for FDI inflows.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} statutory tax rates on the location of Japanese capital in emerging countries. Considering {{the fact that the}} difference between Japan and foreign tax rates can engender transfer pricing manipulation to diminish tax liabilities, and that some firms are more able to manipulate transfer pricing, such as wholly-owned ventures and high technology affiliates, we investigate the sensitivity of Japanese capital to foreign tax rates by distinguishing wholly-owned ventures from joint-ventures and high R&D affiliates from low R&D affiliates. Based on country, parent firm and sector characteristics an investment equation is estimated on a sample of 3774 Japanese affiliates in 49 emerging countries. We obtain a greater semi-elasticity between investment and the statutory tax rate for wholly-owned affiliates and R&D intensive parents.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the ability of {{multinational}} firms to manipulate transfer prices affects the tax sensitivity of foreign direct investment (FDI). We offer a model of international capital allocation where firms are heterogeneous {{in their ability to}} manipulate transfer prices. Perhaps paradoxically, we show that the ability to shift profits can make parent companies' investment more sensitive to host-country tax rates, as long as investors expect fiscal authorities to use price and profit detection methods. We then offer a comprehensive empirical study to test our predictions in the case of Japanese FDI. We exploit the finding that the unobservable ability to manipulate transfer prices is correlated with whole ownership of affiliates and R&D expenditure. Based on country, parent firm and sector characteristics, we estimate an investment equation on a sample of 3614 Japanese affiliates in 49 emerging countries. We obtain a greater semi-elasticity of investment to the statutory tax rate in affiliates that are wholly owned and that have R&D intensive parents. We interpret these results as indirect evidence that abusive transfer pricing is one of the determinants of FDI activity.

40|$|The current {{international}} {{tax system}} allocates the taxation of cross-border income {{by reference to}} the residence of the taxpayer and/or the source of income. The governing rules are contained in domestic tax laws and bilateral tax treaties. As noted by Professor Easson, the current regime of allocation {{is not based on}} any real agreement between nations and cannot be rationalized by any “obvious principle of fairness”. In fact, it is biased in favour of the capital exporting nations that devised the rules of the game. In order to improve fairness, Professor Easson considered it desirable to have some “redistribution” in favour of less developed, net capital-importing nations. Professor Easson was one of few legal scholars that have emphasized the importance of internation equity. International tax literature has recently been preoccupied with efficiency and welfare maximization, predominantly from a one-country perspective. This paper joins Professor Easson in his pursuit of inter-nation equity. The main argument is that inter-nation equity in the sense of fair allocation of tax base as well as international redistribution should be taken seriously in future tax reforms. It demonstrates, at a conceptual level, that inter-nation equity can be improved through adopting a territorial system of taxing business income and redesigning the <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> system. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} tease out the conceptual challenge of identifying inter-nation equity without suggesting any specific mechanism or process by which it might conceivably be resolved...|$|E
40|$|Income {{earned by}} the {{branches}} and subsidiaries of multinational firms {{can be either}} reinvested in the host country or repatriated as dividends to the firms'' headquarters. Despite {{the rapid growth of}} foreign direct investment in the 1990 s, there has been relatively limited analysis of the dividend behavior of multinationals. We find that investors in multinationals from the two largest foreign- investing countries-the United Kingdom and the United States-require a steady flow of dividends, consistent with a view that such regular dividend payments are a mechanism through which to discipline host-country managers. In contrast, German investors, who tend to invest in riskier countries, do not appear to demand persistent dividend payments. Changes in income also influence dividends. This payout ratio from income appears, for example, to be lower for less risky countries. Finally, the evidence suggests that dividend payments do not necessarily aggravate the balance of payments position during crises.

40|$|A {{tax holiday}} is a time-limited {{exemption}} from taxation {{and one of the}} most commonly employed tax incentives in developing countries. The main objective behind tax holidays is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as this is believed to stimulate economic growth and development. An {{exemption from taxation}} under a tax holiday could encourage investors to invest in developing countries. However, this requires the benefit under the tax holiday to actually accrue to the investor and not be consumed by taxation in the investor’s residence country. The subject of this article is the interrelation between tax holidays offered by developing countries and rules in industrialized countries for the taxation of income earned by controlled foreign companies (CFCs). Most countries recognize each company as a separate legal entity (distinct from its shareholders) and as a separate taxpayer. Hence, profits derived by a non-resident company would usually not be taxed to its resident shareholders until profits are remitted as dividends or shares are realized at a gain. This is often described as ‘deferral of domestic tax’, and involves a saving in terms of postponed taxation. If the parent company is resident in a country that does not tax dividends or share gains resulting from foreign subsidiaries (e. g., under participation exemption rules or <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> credit) the investors would receive the full benefit of the tax holiday. This would lead to double non-taxation of the tax holiday income. The question to be raised – in light of the Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) initiative – is whether such double non-taxation should be eliminated, or whether such tax benefits should be recognized as acceptable policy measures of developing countries...|$|E

After presenting some basic sample characteristics, we investigate the scope and prevalence of hidden employment (both unreported employment and employment masked as contract with a subcontractor), its underlying social and economic factors and the main reasons behind accepting or turning down work offers in the hidden economy. Our results suggest that the selection of the particular form of <b>tax</b> <b>sparing</b> employment, i. e. the choice between accepting unreported employment (receiving unreported wage directly into one's own pocket) and employment masked as pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d is determined by the worker's socio-economic background to a great extent. Accepting unreported employment (unreported wage) is more prevalent amongst those {{on the periphery of the}} labor market, while pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d occurs more frequently amongst graduates and those working in public administration, health care, education and culture. We also investigate to what extent the respondents engage in purchasing products and services form the hidden economy. Men purchase from the black economy more often then women, and those living in Budapest also buy products and services there (thus evading VAT payments) more frequently than the rest of the population. Although one would probably expect that members of families with low income engage in unreported transactions more frequently than the others, our results do not support this hypothesis. We also look at the reactions of respondents to hypothetical situations in which reliance on tax evasion and/or corruption seemingly offer a relatively easy and favorable solution. Answers to questions on such hypothetic situations can serve as a control to our results on actual behavior. Those who estimate the share of population receiving income from the hidden economy higher in their neigborhood would be more likely to rely on illegal but economically favorable solutions (such as tax evasion or corruption) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} nature and extent of, and {{possible}} responses to, two of the central challenges that globalization poses for revenue mobilization in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) : from corporate tax competition, and from trade liberalization. It does so using a new dataset with features needed to meaningfully address these issues: a distinction between resourcerelated and other revenues, and a disentangling of tariff from commodity tax revenue. Countries'' experiences vary quite widely, nonresource revenues have been essentially stagnant. Corporate tax revenues have held up, despite a reduction in rates and evidence of substantial base-narrowing-something of a puzzle-and trade tax revenue reductions have been largely offset by other measures. Options for dealing with the continuation and intensification of the challenges, which the present crisis is likely to accelerate-including through regional cooperation-are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} tax {{factors in}} 21 developing {{countries that have}} an impact on foreign direct investment flows. It categorizes those factors into issues associated with tax coordination; tax rates and rate structures; and composition of the tax base. Recent actions by countries reveal no clear pattern in their attempts to increase tax coordination, while many have reduced corporate tax rates and stream-lined tax incentives. However, broad-based tax reform is lacking in most, leaving room for further possibilities in tax reform for attracting foreign investment. The paper also addresses nontax factors that can be instrumental in attracting foreign investment.
