5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a public {{authority}} {{will be considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple ultra vires), or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts <b>that</b> <b>must</b> objectively exist, or in the presence of facts <b>that</b> <b>must</b> not exist, before it has the power to act or decide.|$|E

5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to put it in a phrase, but it has been put in this way: <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> be aberration or weakness of mind; <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> be some form of mental unsoundness; <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> be a state of mind which is bordering on, though not amounting to, insanity; <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> be a mind so affected that responsibility is diminished from full responsibility to partial responsibility. In other words, the prisoner in question must be only partially accountable for his actions. And I think one can see running through the cases that there is implied ... <b>that</b> there <b>must</b> be some form of mental disease.|$|R
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights <b>that</b> <b>must</b> be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives <b>that</b> <b>must</b> be completed to progress {{to the next}} level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy <b>that</b> <b>must</b> treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

60|$|He now {{determined}} to have a consultation between the most eminent physician and the most celebrated practitioner. It was delightful to witness the meeting of these great men. Not a shade of jealousy dimmed the sunshine of their countenances. After a consultation, they agreed that Popanilla's disorder was neither 'liver,' nor 'nervous,' but 'mind:' {{that he had done}} too much; that he had overworked his brain; <b>that</b> he <b>must</b> take more exercise; <b>that</b> he <b>must</b> breathe more air; <b>that</b> he <b>must</b> have relaxation; <b>that</b> he <b>must</b> have a change of scene.|$|R

5|$|Devices <b>that</b> <b>must</b> {{withstand}} {{extremely high}} temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E

5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s assistance <b>that</b> <b>must</b> (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities. Examples of this include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts <b>that</b> <b>must</b> objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E

Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms <b>that</b> <b>must</b> deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E
