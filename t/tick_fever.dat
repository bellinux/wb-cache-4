5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever,</b> Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E

50|$|The Cattle tick, (Rhipicephalus annulatus), is a hard-bodied tick of {{the genus}} Rhipicephalus. It {{is also known as}} North American cattle tick, North American Texas <b>fever</b> <b>tick,</b> and Texas <b>fever</b> <b>tick.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> is {{often based on}} symptoms. Definitive diagnosis is made by culture, PCR, or immunofluorescence. Data about the appropriate treatment of African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> is limited. Symptoms tend to be mild and often resolve on their own. However, when people seek medical treatment, physicians may treat the infection with antibiotics used to treat other rickettsial infections, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} of Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus {{is in the}} Rocky Mountain area of the United States at elevations between four and ten thousand feet. Not surprisingly, Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus {{can be found in}} places like California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, British Columbia, and Alberta. This is roughly the same distribution as the tick that transmits the virus, shown in the adjacent picture.|$|E
25|$|Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus can be {{detected}} in a patient with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), where even a single virion and its genetic material can {{be detected}}. The antigens to the virus can also be detected using immunofluorescence. There is currently no known vaccine or treatment available to treat these Coltiviruses, but 3'-fluors-3'-deoxyadanosine, a nucleoside analog, halts replication of Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus in vitro.|$|E
25|$|The main {{species of}} Coltivirus, Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CTF), infects the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). This species of tick {{can be found}} in areas with shrubs, lightly wooded locations, grasslands, and on hiking or biking trails. All life stages of this tick can infect {{vertebrates}} with Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus (larva, nymph, and adult). Unfortunately, mature D. andersoni prefer to feed on medium or large mammals that are walking around the knee-high plants. Oftentimes, this infection takes place when the tick larvae feed on rodents, like squirrels, that are already infected with virus. The tick's saliva then contains the virus, and it becomes infectious for life. The adult tick then transmits the virus to humans through a bite, where it infects bone marrow cells.|$|E

50|$|African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> (ATBF) is {{a disease}} caused by the {{bacterium}} Rickettsia africae in sub-Saharan Africa and the West Indies. The bacterium is transmitted to humans by ticks in the Amblyomma genus. African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> {{is a type of}} spotted fever. Symptoms are not always present. Symptoms may include a fever, headache, rash and dead tissue at bite sites. These generally occur within 4-10 days of a tick bite. The clinical symptoms are typically mild and resolve within 3 weeks. Severe complications are very rare.|$|R
25|$|For diagnosis, the {{erythrocytes}} can {{be isolated}} by injecting {{them into a}} tissue culture and {{checking to see if}} they are infected. Also, the antigen for Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus can be identified using the immunofluorescence microscopy.

25|$|Some {{parasitic}} forms affect {{humans and}} other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, {{and can even}} be vectors of diseases, such as scrub typhus, rickettsialpox, Lyme disease, Q fever, Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever,</b> tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and tick-borne meningoencephalitis. A well known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|The Florida cowhunter or cracker cowboy {{tradition}} gradually assimilated {{to western}} cowboy tradition during the 20th century (although the vaquero tradition {{has had little}} influence in Florida). Texas <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> and the screw-worm were introduced to Florida in the early 20th century by cattle entering from other states. These pests forced Florida cattlemen to separate individual animals from their herds at frequent intervals for treatment, which {{eventually led to the}} widespread use of lassos. Florida cowboys continue to use dogs and bullwhips for controlling cattle.|$|E
50|$|Looking at {{published}} data {{over the}} past 35 years, close to 200 confirmed cases of African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> in international travelers have been reported. The majority (~80%) of these cases occurred in travelers returning from South Africa.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: African tick-bite fever, a tickborne disease {{caused by}} Rickettsia africae, is endemic {{in rural areas}} of sub-Saharan Africa and in the French West Indies. Most cases {{reported}} in the literature occurred in middle-aged, otherwise-healthy persons and corresponded to benign diseases. The course of African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> in elderly people is less well documented. METHODS: The medical records of 8 elderly patients infected with R. africae during a trip to South Africa in 2005 are presented to summarize the epidemiologic, clinical, microbiological, treatment, and disease course characteristics. RESULTS: Eight patients, aged 63 - 75 years, developed African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> symptoms after a trip to South Africa. R. africae was grown from cutaneous eschar biopsy specimens obtained from 4 patients, confirming African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever.</b> We observed unusual findings in this elderly population. Rash was frequent (present in 87. 5 % of patients), vesicular (in 100 % of patients with rash), and often associated with an enanthema (in 50 % of patients with rash). Severe clinical manifestations occurred: lymphangitis and myocarditis in 1 patient and suspected brain involvement in 2 patients. We observed severe and long-lasting general symptoms, including fever (in 75 % of patients), chills (87. 5 %), asthenia (50 %), anorexia (50 %), and weight loss (12. 5 %). With doxycycline therapy, the outcome was favorable in all cases, but complete recovery was slow. CONCLUSION: Ecotourism to sub-Saharan Africa is expanding, and people of advanced age, often with underlying chronic diseases, account for an increasing proportion of travelers. African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> appears to be more symptomatic in this population. Recommendations advising personal prophylactic measures to prevent tick bites in travelers to regions of endemicity may be particularly important for elderly individuals...|$|R
50|$|In 2013, the {{infectious}} agent of American <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever,</b> Rickettsia parkeri was detected in a female A. maculatum collected at Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, near Smyrna, Delaware, providing {{the first evidence}} of association of this pathogen of humans with this species of tick in the state.|$|R
25|$|The European Eyach {{virus and}} the Colorado <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> virus are known {{relatives}} due to cognate genes, 55% to 88% of amino acid similarity, and similarities at the microscopic level that cannot be distinguished. To find these similarities, a genome sequence analysis was completed. One theory {{of how the}} European Eyach virus is proposed to have come about in Europe is by the migration of lagomorphs from North America over fifty million years ago. Since then, the virus took on some differences, and is now considered its own species of virus. European Eyach virus was isolated in 1976 from Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe and in 1981 from the same species along with Ixodes ventalloi in 1981.|$|E
500|$|Brumby populations {{also may}} have the {{potential}} to pass exotic diseases, such as equine influenza and African horse sickness to domestic horses. [...] They also may carry <b>tick</b> <b>fever,</b> which can be passed to both horses and cattle. This can lead to high fatalities among domestic populations, causing many farmers to call for the management of feral horses.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Jardine {{travelled}} to Rhodesia, {{again to}} inspect some land, {{with his daughter}} Marion. While there, he became ill with <b>tick</b> <b>fever.</b> He showed no improvement upon his return to England and further tests revealed that he had advanced lung cancer. After some treatment, he travelled with his wife to a clinic in Switzerland but {{it was discovered that}} the cancer had spread and was incurable. He died in Switzerland on [...] 1958 and his ashes were scattered over the top of Craigs Cross mountain in Perthshire, Scotland. His family had enquired about having his ashes dispersed at Lord's, but this honour was restricted to war dead. When he died, his estate was valued at just over £71,000, which would have been worth around £1¼ million in 2008.|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1800 s, a disease known as ?Texas Cattle Fever? became an {{economic}} and epidemiologic problem for cattle ranchers in Texas {{and parts of the}} southern United States. A tick-borne hemoparasite known as Babesia which infects red blood cells of its hosts is the cause of this disease, which is sometimes also referred to as bovine babesiosis. Tick vectors of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. carry the Babesia species and a 37 year eradication effort known as the Cattle <b>Fever</b> <b>Tick</b> Eradication Program was conducted to rid the country of these vectors. A Cattle <b>Fever</b> <b>Tick</b> quarantine buffer zone has been maintained since along the Texas-Mexico border, however, since this neighboring country failed to eradicate the tick, there is a threat of possible reintroduction and re-establishment of Cattle <b>Fever</b> <b>Ticks</b> in the U. S. The occurrence of <b>fever</b> <b>tick</b> outbreaks has become more frequent within recent years and the location of these outbreaks is moving further northward from the Texas-Mexico border.

40|$|To {{estimate}} the incidence of, identify risk factors for, {{and describe the}} clinical presentation of travel-associated African <b>tick</b> bite <b>fever</b> (ATBF), a rapidly emerging disease in travel medicine, we prospectively studied a cohort of 940 travelers to rural sub-Equatorial Africa. Diagnosis was based on suicide polymerase chain reaction and the detection of specific antibodies to Rickettia africae in serum samples by multiple-antigen microimmu-nofluorescence assay, Western blotting, and cross-adsorption assays. Thirty-eight travelers, 4. 0 % of the cohort and 26. 6 % of those reporting flulike symptoms, had ATBF diagnosed. More than 80 % of the patients had fever, headache, and/or myalgia, whereas specific clinical features such as inoculation eschars, lymphadenitis, cutaneous rash, and aphthous stomatitis were seen in 50 % of patients.
