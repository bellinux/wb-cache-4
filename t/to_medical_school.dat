5|$|Soedjatmoko later {{attended}} the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940.

Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, he was drawn to the issue of poverty; this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah– and participation in protests against the occupation.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{shortage}} of physicians {{in rural areas}} and in some specialties is a societal problem in Japan. Expensive tuition in private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> limits access <b>to</b> them particularly for students from middle- and low-income families. One way to reduce this barrier and lessen maldistribution is to offer conditional scholarships <b>to</b> private <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> Methods: A discrete choice experiment is carried out on a total of 374 students considering application <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> <b>schools.</b> The willingness <b>to</b> receive a conditional scholarship program <b>to</b> private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> is analyzed. Results: The probability of attending private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> significantly decreased because of high tuition, a postgraduate obligation to provide a service in specific specialty areas, {{and the length of}} time of this obligation. An obligation to provide a service in rural regions had no significant effect on this probability. To motivate non-applicants <b>to</b> private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> <b>to</b> enroll in such schools, a decrease in tuition to around 1. 2 million yen (US$ 12 000) or less, which is twice that of public schools, was found to be necessary. Further, it was found that non-applicants <b>to</b> private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> choose <b>to</b> apply to such schools even with restrictions if they have tuition support at the public school level. Conclusions: Conditional scholarships for private <b>medical</b> <b>schools</b> may widen access <b>to</b> <b>medical</b> education and simultaneously provide incentives to work in insufficiently served areas...|$|R
