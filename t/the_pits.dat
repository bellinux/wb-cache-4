40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> Summer Camp <b>Pit</b> (SCP) is {{situated}} on the Placer Dome owned Getchell Property in Northern Nevada. The deposit is a typical Carlin type partly oxidized disseminated sulfide-micron gold deposit in strongly deformed and altered Paleozoic metasediments. <b>The</b> <b>pit</b> was mined by a former site owner from March 1990 to December 1991. Although <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> was mostly dry during operations, flows increased as mining deepened <b>the</b> <b>pit,</b> forcing <b>the</b> operators to begin periodic pumping of a small sump in the SW corner of <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> A small sump developed which due to sulfide oxidation showed low pH and elevated metals and sulfate. To buffer this chemistry <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> was partly filled by water from the underground mining operations approximately 1 mile {{to the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> and <b>the</b> water level maintained above the oxide-sulfide boundary. <b>The</b> <b>pit</b> lake was monitored at the site for approximately 10 years and during this time <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> was used as part of the site water management strategy.

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became stuck in asphalt puddles which seeped {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>pits,</b> 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid asphalt, which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from <b>the</b> <b>pits.</b> The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the area around <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} built-up and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century.

40|$|Abstract. A regional-scale {{three-dimensional}} model was developed using MODFLOW-SURFACT to delineate the capture zone and groundwater flow regime {{associated with a}} large open pit mine situated in low-permeability mountainous terrain. In low-permeability mountainous settings, local-scale flow systems often develop between elevated terrain and local drainages. Accurate representation of these flow systems through robust handling of recharge and seepage across the land surface interface proved critical in representing the true three-dimensional nature of <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> capture zone. <b>The</b> approach further allowed for more accurate representation of recharge, discharge, and the directions of groundwater flow associated with stockpiles near <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> Modeling {{results indicate that the}} pre-stockpile surface topography largely controls the direction of flow of recharged groundwater near <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> and <b>the</b> nature and extent of <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> capture zone. <b>The</b> <b>pit</b> capture zone is herein defined as the surface area over which particles released at the water table report to <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> <b>The</b> modeling results further indicate that deeper groundwater from a larger area also discharges into <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> With greater depth, the influence of the local surface topography dissipates, and the influence of the hydraulic sink associated with <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> increases, resulting in a transition of groundwater flow controlled by local surface topography to groundwater flow controlled by <b>the</b> <b>pit...</b>|$|R
5|$|On the {{northern}} side of canal was the terminus for the tramroad which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits.

The southern side of the canal basin was connected to <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> at Brittens, Littlebrook, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill by a tramway which terminated at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased.

In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries.

5|$|The canal had {{to contend}} with initial {{opposition}} from the carters, who used force to prevent coal being taken from <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> to the loading points.

5|$|A {{scheme for}} an {{extension}} of the Avon Navigation was proposed in 1766, but canals did not reach the coalfield for almost another 50 years. In 1794 coal proprietors formed a committee to construct the Somerset Coal Canal with two branches into the Cam Brook and Wellow Brook Valleys, and from a junction at Midford, to join the proposed Kennet and Avon Canal at the Dundas Aqueduct near Bath. Coal was transported by the Somerset Coal Canal and later by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway and Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which were accessed from <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> by a series of tramways. After 1854, when the first railway line was opened, the tonnage carried by the coal canal declined rapidly.|$|E

50|$|The more {{conventional}} explanation for pitting corrosion {{is that it}} is an autocatalytic process. Metal oxidation results in localised acidity that is maintained by the spatial separation of the cathodic and anodic half-reactions, which creates a potential gradient and electromigration of aggressive anions into <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> For example, when a metal is present in an oxygenated NaCl electrolyte, <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> acts as anode and the metal surface acts as cathode. The localised production of positive metal ions in <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> gives a local excess of positive charge which attracts the negative chlorine ions from the electrolyte to produce charge neutrality. <b>The</b> <b>pit</b> contains a high concentration of MCl molecules which react with water to produce HCl, the metal hydroxide, and H+ ions, accelerating the corrosion process.In <b>the</b> <b>pit,</b> <b>the</b> oxygen concentration is essentially zero and all of the cathodic oxygen reactions take place on the metal surface outside <b>the</b> <b>pit.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pit</b> is anodic and the locus of rapid dissolution of the metal. The metal corrosion initiation is autocatalytic in nature however its propagation is not.|$|R
