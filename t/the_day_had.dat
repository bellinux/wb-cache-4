5|$|<b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> {{been bad}} for the Luftwaffe. Losses {{amounted}} to 18 Ju 52s; four belonged to III./KG.z.b.V 1. Raids by RAF Vickers Wellington bombers continued during the night. Ju 88 night fighters from NJG 2 downed two Wellingtons. The results of the raids are not known.|$|E
5|$|Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> been quiet. When the {{commander}} of the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpić sent a truck-mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. The platoon was ambushed en route, with 14 Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of 26 June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, but held out.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Panzer Division, {{advancing}} on {{the left}} flank of Großdeutschland, made good progress {{and by the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> captured Gertsovka and reached Mikhailovka. The 167th Infantry Division, on the right flank of the 11th Panzer Division, also made sufficient progress, reaching Tirechnoe by the end of the day. By the end of 5 July, a wedge had been created in the first belt of the Soviet defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{claims were}} a massive exaggeration. But while the Big Wing had proven {{physically}} ineffective {{for the most}} part, its biggest contribution to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> been its use as a psychological weapon. The German bomber units that had seen the Big Wing form up were quite shocked, and those crews in the badly hit units, including KG 2 and KG 3, that had witnessed head-on collisions with German aircraft were badly shaken.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral lesson was noted. Adrift, like all other American silents of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>had</b> no musical accompaniment, but a letter written into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 17th century, England was {{embroiled in}} {{conflict}} with commercial rival Holland through the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Rupert became closely involved in these as a senior Admiral to King Charles II, rising to command the Royal Navy {{by the end of}} his career. Although several famous admirals of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> previously been army commanders, including Blake and Monk, they had commanded relatively small land forces and Rupert was still relatively unusual for the period in having both practical experience of commanding large land armies and having extensive naval experience from his campaigns in the 1650s.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|Mickal had a {{slow start}} to 1935 while he {{recovered}} from a broken ankle he suffered over the summer. In week three, he threw two touchdown passes against Manhattan College, and a game-winning touchdown pass against Vanderbilt two weeks later. In the regular season finale, Mickal was responsible for three touchdowns in a 41–0 win over rival Tulane. LSU faced the TCU Horned Frogs {{at the end of}} the season in the Sugar Bowl, in a game that was a highly anticipated match-up between Mickal and the Horned Frogs' Sammy Baugh. The offenses were unable to do much, however, as rain throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> muddied the field. TCU won the game, 3–2. LSU finished the season undefeated in conference play for its first SEC championship. Mickal was named to the AP All-SEC second-team as a fullback after the season, and earned second-team All-America honors from Liberty magazine.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} hard for him to tell; and hard for many more: for all <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>have</b> passed as in a fever dream. To cowards the time has seemed endless; and every moment, ere their term shall come, an age of terror, of self-reproach, of superstitious prayers, and cries, which are not repentance. And to some cowards, too, <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>have</b> seemed but as a moment; for they <b>have</b> been drunk <b>day</b> and night.|$|R

5|$|South of {{the river}} Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, {{commander}} of XXX Corps and Lieutenant-General Frederick Browning of I Airborne Corps, decided not to reinforce the position north of the Rhine. Instead they ordered the Corps staff to prepare a plan to withdraw the division (Operation Berlin). The evacuation of the surviving 2,500men {{able to make the}} crossing was to begin at 20:45. The evacuation would be from north to south, and was modelled on the evacuation from Gallipoli in the First World War. During the day's fighting, some units had become isolated and never received the order to evacuate. Those capable of taking part were formed into groups of fourteen (the maximum capacity of the boats) and guided to the river by men from the Glider Pilot Regiment who during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> reconnoitred and marked out two routes to the river. Under cover of an artillery barrage the evacuation started at 22:00. German infiltration of the perimeter caused problems during the withdrawal and some groups got into fire fights or were captured. When they reached the river, priority was given to the wounded and regardless of rank the soldiers waited in line for their turn to get into the boats.|$|E
25|$|However it was {{conceded that}} the ERU team on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> no way of {{guessing}} what his intentions were, and could not have let him exit the outer perimeter with a loaded shotgun {{that he had been}} discharging frequently for two days.|$|E

25|$|Carson {{and many}} other {{soldiers}} of the Regular Brigade {{and a few other}} supporting regiments did not escape with most of Thomas's men but were captured late in the day after they ran out of ammunition. Nonetheless, Carson's bugle calls earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> not only rallied the troops but had led the Confederates to believe that the Union line had been reinforced. General Bragg delayed a charge on the Union position from 3:30 pm to almost 6:30 pm when all his available forces had been gathered for the assault. By the time the charge was made and the small group of remaining defenders had to surrender, most of the Union Army that had not fled even earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> escaped and was nearing the defenses of Chattanooga.|$|E
25|$|A {{political}} issue of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> {{to do with}} whether to give immigrants financial assistance.

About 400 people participated in the parade, {{according}} to NGO ACCEPT, the organizer of the festival.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>had</b> dawned {{clear and}} fine, as the knights and their entourages {{struggled}} to organise the parade the sky began to darken.

25|$|While the Louisville riots of 1968 {{had many}} causes (most directly, {{the spread of}} false rumors and bottles being thrown into the crowd) the crowd where the riot began had {{gathered}} to protest the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier.
