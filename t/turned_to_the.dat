5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on February7 south of Diego Garcia. For about a week, the system remained weak and changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady track to the southwest. On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast and weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Sergio was {{the third}} strongest Pacific {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} November on record. The nineteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Sergio developed from a tropical wave on November 13 about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on November 15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. Sergio later <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, remaining well off the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November 20 about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of it originally formed.|$|E
5|$|Late on August 29, Hurricane Edouard {{developed}} three concentric eyewalls, {{an unusual}} occurrence coinciding {{with an increase}} in strength to 140mph (220km/h). A mid-tropospheric trough turned the hurricane to the north to an area of unfavorable conditions, and Edouard weakened to a Category3 hurricanes on August 31. On September 1, the hurricane passed about midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-northeast. Edouard continued to weaken as it <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, and on September 2 passed about 95mi (150km) to the southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane, its closest point of approach to the United States. Edouard weakened to tropical storm status on September 3, and became extratropical shortly thereafter while located to the south of Nova Scotia. As an extratropical storm, Edouard <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, then moved around the periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by the storm early on September 7.|$|E

The hurricane continued to intensify with an eye 20miles (32km) in diameter, and on May 21 Reconnaissance Aircraft estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h). Shortly thereafter Able passed about 70miles (110km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and early on May 22 Able weakened from its peak intensity after turning to the east. On May 23 it deteriorated into a tropical storm while passing over cooler waters, and that night Able became an extratropical cyclone while located about 520miles (840km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

5|$|Tropical Storm Doria was the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm of the season, Doria developed from a tropical wave on August 20 {{to the east}} of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development it attained tropical storm status {{to the east of}} Florida. Doria <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and reached peak winds of 65mph (105km/h) as it was making landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina.

On January24, the JTWC upgraded Hyacinthe to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, with winds of 120km/h (75mph). After approaching within 175km (120mi) west-southwest of Réunion, the cyclone <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest and executed another loop. The JTWC estimated that Hyacinthe reached peak winds of 130km/h (80mph) on January25, which the storm maintained for about 24hours. During that time, Hyacinthe <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast and later weakened. On January26, it moved near Réunion for the third time, passing about 105km (65mi) to the south. The storm turned southward, becoming extratropical on January29.

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on November 4.|$|E
5|$|A dissipating {{cold front}} stalled across the {{northeast}}ern Atlantic Ocean on September7, {{northeast of the}} Azores. That day, a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of the front. Based on a uniform thermal structure, as well as ship reports {{in the region of}} gale-force winds near the center, it is estimated that the system became a tropical storm early on September8. That day, the system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September9, the storm <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on ship observations. Moving slowly through the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of 35mph (55km/h) along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September10 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds. The storm <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest through the Iberian Peninsula, dissipating on September14 over southwestern France.|$|E
5|$|A {{ridge to}} the north turned Gordon to the west-northwest, and by November 14 the cloud pattern resembled that of a {{subtropical}} cyclone, with little convection near and the strongest winds well-removed from the center. The storm paralleled the northern coast of Cuba and gradually developed convection near the center. On November15, the broad center crossed the Florida Keys near Key West. An approaching trough turned Gordon {{to the north}}east, bringing it ashore near Fort Myers, Florida on November 16 with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Gordon crossed the Florida peninsula in about nine hours, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach. As it reached the Gulf Stream, a small but intense area of convection developed over the center, and after the Hurricane Hunters reported flight-level winds in excess of 90mph (145km/h), Gordon attained hurricane status late on November17 about 245miles (345km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, it reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the trough that had turned the hurricane to the north {{was replaced by a}} ridge. Gordon turned abruptly northwestward, and was briefly expected to cross the Outer Banks as a minimal hurricane. The hurricane <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and south-southeast, weakening into a tropical storm due to stronger shear and drier air. On November19, the storm <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest and later to the west.
