40|$|We {{consider}} the Klein-Gordon equation on a star-shaped network composed of n half-axes connected at their origins. We add a potential which is constant but different on each branch. The corresponding spatial operator is self-adjoint and we state explicit expressions for its resolvent and its {{resolution of the}} identity in terms of generalized eigenfunctions. This leads to a generalized Fourier type inversion formula {{in terms of an}} expansion in generalized eigenfunctions. Further we prove the surjectivity of the associated transformation, thus showing that it is in fact a spectral representation. The characteristics of the problem are marked by the non-manifold character of the star-shaped domain. Therefore the approach via the Sturm-Liouville theory for systems is not well-suited. The considerable effort to construct explicit formulas involving the <b>tunnel</b> <b>effect</b> generalized eigenfunctions is justified for example by the perspective to study the influence of <b>tunnel</b> <b>effect</b> on the L-infinity-time decay.

30|$|In addition, {{during the}} recent decades since the {{implementation}} of the economic reform policies, despite the leaps of economic growth and modernization, development has not resulted in the <b>tunnel</b> <b>effect.</b> Instead, it promoted relative deprivation and intensified the negative effect of social inequality on SWB.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the de Sitter cosmology deformed {{by the presence}} of a thermal bath of radiation and/or time-dependent moduli fields.
