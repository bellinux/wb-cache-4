5|$|Transport {{links between}} Rijeka and Zagreb {{have always been}} of {{substantial}} importance because of the transport requirements of the Port of Rijeka. This was first recognised by the Habsburg Empire in 1728, when the Carolina road was completed, and again in 1780 when the road was modernized. The original RijekaZagreb road was replaced in 1811 by a new route, the Louisiana road, {{in order to avoid}} the steep sections of its predecessor. The new road remained the primary <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to Rijeka until 1873, when the first railroad to the city was built. Further development of the port and industry in Rijeka and Zagreb required a more efficient road, which was built in 1954. That road was to remain the principal road <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> between the two cities for decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} {{continues the}} freeway section of Highway 4 further south, {{by removing the}} traffic light at this junction, and also added grade separation with the railway. The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city {{from the start of}} its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme is {{situated}} near the A34 Cheadle bypass, {{as well as}} international <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the United Kingdom outside London. The A5419 and B5095 roads traverse Cheadle Hulme; there are many buses that operate {{on a daily basis}} throughout the area, with frequent services to and from Stockport bus station, passing through neighbouring towns and villages. There are also services to Manchester Piccadilly Gardens, as well as to places such as Woodford, Macclesfield, Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport. Most buses are operated by Stagecoach Manchester.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the railway to Pine Creek, the Adelaide River crossing was the overnight stopping point for the Haimes Royal Mail Coach which linked Southport with the goldfields. This was a vital and well utilised <b>transport</b> <b>link,</b> but was a slow and uncomfortable service. Legislation providing for an upgraded <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> was passed in 1883 by the government of John Cox Bray {{in the form of the}} Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Bill.|$|E
25|$|The quickest public <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to the {{mainland}} is the hovercraft from Ryde to Southsea; three ferry and two catamaran services cross the Solent to Southampton, Lymington and Portsmouth.|$|E

25|$|The Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor (SSTC) is a {{proposed}} <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> from the A19, {{through the city}} centre, to the port. A major phase of the plan {{is the creation of}} a new bridge, which will link the A1231 Wessington Way on the north of the river with the Grove site in Pallion, on the south of the river.|$|E

25|$|On its completion, the M1 {{acted as}} a fast link road between London and Birmingham. It also {{provided}} a link to London Luton Airport for these regions, and its proximity {{to the site of}} the Milton Keynes new town (designated in 1967) meant that it was soon providing a vital <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to another major area.|$|E
25|$|With Caernarfon Council {{having a}} longer term plan to {{reinstate}} the town's rail <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to Bangor, speculation mounted that the FR/WHR would potentially later extend itself. However, the Ffestiniog Railway {{wrote to the}} council in January 2014 to confirm {{that they would not}} themselves be supportive of such a scheme in narrow gauge, but supported the reconnection of the town to the national rail network using standard gauge.|$|E
25|$|Second Harbour Crossing is {{the name}} given to the {{proposed}} second <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> over the Waitematā Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand. The second link would supplement the Auckland Harbour Bridge which is nearly at capacity and also provide more redundancy and added public transport linkages between Auckland City and North Shore City. It is sometimes also called the Third Harbour Crossing, as there is already an Upper Harbour Bridge (or Greenhithe Bridge). More recently, it is named Additional Waitematā Harbour Crossing (AWHC) in planning documents.|$|E

25|$|The cross river ferry {{service in}} Liverpool, {{known as the}} Mersey Ferry, is managed and {{operated}} by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour {{during the middle of}} the day and during weekends. Despite remaining an important <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.|$|E
25|$|The Dublin Bus termini for the 7, 7a, 7b, 7d and 46e are on {{the north}} side of the square and run toward the south east of the city. Routes 33, 41, 41b and 41c stop on the west side of the squ{{are on the}}ir way to the {{northern}} suburbs. The square's bus stops are also covered by the hop-on, hop-off city centre 75 cent fare. The 41 bus is almost certainly the cheapest <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> to Dublin Airport from the city at €2.70 (as of 2017) from the square. The main entrance to Dublin Bus' Summerhill Depot is on Mountjoy Place, just off the south-east corner of the square.|$|E
25|$|Now, {{the area}} has two railway lines that have been {{tunnelled}} through the sandstone beneath. One is no longer open for transport; the other remains part of the main south trunk line. The first tunnel was established in December 1873. The second completed in 1910, the tunnels provided a <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> {{to and from the}} city and other urban areas of Dunedin until the 1960s. The Caversham railway station, only 10 to 15 minutes walk from any part of Calton Hill, was the nearest station. In addition to the railway line, between 1880 and 1940, residents could also use the Dunedin cable tramway system. The nearest station was also at Caversham.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} a water and {{recreation}} resource, the river was historically a critical communications and <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> for the communities along it. It took about 3 days to paddle a waka from Waiuku to the Cambridge/Te Awamutu area. Taupo, Mangakino, Cambridge, Hamilton, Horotiu, Ngaruawahia, Huntly, Hampton Downs, Meremere, Waiuku and Port Waikato are on or close to it. The Waikato River in Hamilton is frequently used by rowers, kayakers and powered pleasure craft. Water-skiers and jet skis have zones outside the city limits {{where they can be}} used. There are two ramps for launching boats – one in Pukete and the other just north of the traffic (Bridge St) bridge.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Chabahar-Milak-Zaranj-Delaram {{route from}} Iran to Afghanistan is in progress. Iran is, with Indian aid, {{upgrading}} the Chabahar-Milak road and constructing a bridge {{on the route}} to Zaranj. India's BRO is laying the 213km Zaranj-Delaram road. It {{is a part of}} India's USD 750 million aid package to Afghanistan. The Chabahar port project is Iran's chance to end its US-sponsored economic isolation and benefit from the resurgent Indian economy. Along with Bandar Abbas, Chabahar is the Iranian entrepot on the North-South corridor. A strategic partnership between India, Iran and Russia is intended to establish a multi-modal <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> connecting Mumbai with St Petersburg, providing Europe and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia access to Asia and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The first wharf operations, {{primarily}} for trade and commercial purposes began in 1792, along the inner {{western edge of}} Sydney Cove, now {{in the vicinity of}} First Fleet Park and west of Circular Quay station. As the colony continued to mature and, coinciding with the development of trade and the discovery of gold in the 1850s, rapid development occurred around Sydney Cove, leading to new and larger warehouse stores and the beginnings of foreshore reclamation. One of the most prominent engineering works from this period is the Argyle Cut, a large open-cut passage through the contours of Sydney sandstone in the area and which formed an important <b>transport</b> <b>link</b> between The Rocks, Sydney Cove, Barangaroo and Darling Harbour, completed in 1859.|$|E
