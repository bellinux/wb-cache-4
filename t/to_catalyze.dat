5|$|The {{primary cause}} of lead's {{toxicity}} is its interference {{with a variety of}} enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability <b>to</b> <b>catalyze</b> its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used <b>to</b> <b>catalyze</b> the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
