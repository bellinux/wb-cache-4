5|$|During World War II, Keating was {{stationed}} in the U.S., sometimes at Banana Creek in Florida, and flew Hellcats to armed services swimming meets. He narrowly escaped serious injury one night at Naval Air Station Vero Beach when he neglected to lower the landing gear on his Hellcat and wrecked the plane in an unexpected belly landing. Due to additional training on new intercept methods and <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of squadron transfers, the war ended before he would be deployed to any combat theater.|$|E

5|$|Kenney {{informed}} Whitehead of {{the proposed}} convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as {{to allow for a}} large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} for {{information}} on the missionaries is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of the medieval writer Bede, written around 731. Bede details several {{of the members of the}} mission. Another important source of information is the papal registers which list copies of Gregory's letters sent to the missionaries. Neither source gives a complete listing of the missionaries in either group, so a listing of members must be gathered from scattered references in Bede and Gregory's letters. Although it is known that about 40 people were included in the first group, how many arrived in the second group is unknown. <b>The</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the evidence allow only some of the missionaries to be named.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. <b>The</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E

5|$|Four Times of the Day is {{a series}} of four {{paintings}} by English artist William Hogarth. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four engravings published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. Unlike many of Hogarth's other series, such as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress, Industry and Idleness, and The Four Stages of Cruelty, it does not depict the story of an individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works.|$|E
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the wind.|$|E
5|$|The draft-Constitution {{was to be}} {{subjected}} to a referendum on 8 August 1797, after a very lively campaign in which the French ambassador Noël weighed in with a supportive appeal. This probably contributed to the resounding defeat of the proposal (108,761 votes to 27,995). The Assembly was back at square one. At this moment in time foreign events {{in the form of the}} 18 Fructidor coup of general Pierre Augereau intervened. This brought the more radical faction to power in France, which proved to be ultimately less patient with <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the Dutch political process, and more prone to intervene. Elections for a second National Assembly returned one in which the balance of power had shifted to the unitarists in the Fall of 1797. Nevertheless, the federalists managed to retain control of the new constitutional commission by a bare majority. This led to more dawdling and the unitarists in the Assembly now came with their own proposal in the form of the Declaration of 43 on 12 December 1797, containing a nine-point manifesto concerning the minimum conditions to which the new constitution should conform.|$|E

50|$|His works, {{including}} landscapes, genre, and portraits, {{have the}} bright chromatic sensibility of post-impressionism or late-Macchiaioli painters. The critic M. Bernardi stated that Conterno affirmed subtlety, the aristocracy of touch, the serene poetry that diffuses from his placid and accurate painterliness Schialvino describes it {{him as a}} painter able to depict small things made large by the insufflation of a poetic spirit, depictions, despite <b>the</b> <b>vagary</b> of <b>the</b> subject, full of intimacy, exquisiteness, preciosity, meditation, solemnity, and religion. A retrospective of his work was displayed in 1953 at the Circolo degli Artisti, in Turin.|$|R

5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

25|$|Playing as a wicket-keeper batsman, Bisset scored 35 and 21* {{and took}} a catch and a stumping.

6000|$|But {{that night}} this {{speculative}} man {{felt in the}} mood for fancies, for presently he was staring at one of the constellations, and saying to himself, [...] "Why not? Well, why not? Granted force can travel through ether,--whatever ether is--why should it stop travelling? Give it time enough, a few seconds, or a few minutes or a few years, and why should it not reach that star? Very likely it does, only there it wastes itself. What would be needed to make it serviceable? Simply this--that on the star there should dwell an Intelligence armed with one of my instruments, when I have perfected them, or the secret of them. Then who knows what might happen?" [...] and he laughed a little to himself at <b>the</b> <b>vagary.</b>|$|R
60|$|Varied {{emotions}} {{filled the}} breasts {{of the several}} riders who wended their slow way down the mud-slippery road. Norman of Torn was both elated and sad. Elated {{that he had been}} in time to save this girl who awakened such strange emotions in his breast; sad that he was a loathesome thing in her eyes. But that it was pure happiness just to be near her, sufficed him for the time; of the morrow, what use to think! The little, grim, gray, old man of Torn nursed the spleen he did not dare vent openly, and cursed the chance that had sent Henry de Montfort to Torn to search for his sister; while the followers of the outlaw swore quietly over <b>the</b> <b>vagary</b> which had brought them on this long ride without either fighting or loot.|$|R

25|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of {{the cube}} tower, {{it can be}} very {{difficult}} to predict the outcome of any battle. Many cubes can be poured into the tower, while only a few may come out.

25|$|Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones was {{published}} six years later, in 1904, in two volumes, and remains a standard reference. In {{keeping with the}} standards of the times, much of <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of his personal life were glossed over (the years of the episode with Maria Zambaco fall neatly into a period somewhere between the end of Volume 1 and the beginning of Volume 2).|$|E
25|$|Pocock loved playing cricket, and {{had plenty}} of {{theories}} and experiments if the opposing batsmen got on top. His entire first-class cricket career was spent with Surrey County Cricket Club, and {{he got his first}} taste of <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of international selection, when he replaced Fred Titmus, who had lost four toes in a boating accident, on the 1967–68 tour to the West Indies.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>vagary</b> of Timothy Fairway was infectious. The turf-cutter seized old Olly Dowden, and, {{somewhat}} more gently, poussetted with her likewise. The {{young men were}} not slow to imitate the example of their elders, and seized the maids; Grandfer Cantle and his stick jigged {{in the form of}} a three-legged object among the rest; and in half a minute all that could be seen on Rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid a boiling confusion of sparks, which leapt around the dancers as high as their waists. The chief noises were women's shrill cries, men's laughter, Susan's stays and pattens, Olly Dowden's [...] "heu-heu-heu!" [...] and the strumming of the wind upon the furze-bushes, which formed a kind of tune to the demoniac measure they trod. Christian alone stood aloof, uneasily rocking himself as he murmured, [...] "They ought not to do it--how the vlankers do fly! 'tis tempting the Wicked one, 'tis." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{internal}} decorative {{features of}} a cathedral or great church might follow a carefully conceived scheme which might continue the theme begun on the west front. There are many examples which give evidence of this, and include the mosaic vaults of Orthodox churches, the stained glass windows of Medieval churches and the sculptural schemes of Baroque churches. However, in many other cases, any unified scheme has been lost with <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of the building's history.|$|E
25|$|In October 1834 a great fire {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of reform. When the Whig {{ministry of}} Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the King, The Times newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though {{she seems to have}} had {{very little to do with}} it. Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, she did write to the King against reform of the Church of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{and writer}} Paul Schrader append the perfect {{conclusion}} to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores <b>the</b> <b>vagaries</b> of fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, {{had he been}} a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, {{he would have been}} reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl.|$|E
60|$|Setting {{down his}} basin, the negro searched among the razors, {{as for the}} sharpest, and having found it, gave it an {{additional}} edge by expertly strapping it on the firm, smooth, oily skin of his open palm; he then made a gesture as if to begin, but midway stood suspended for an instant, one hand elevating the razor, the other professionally dabbling among the bubbling suds on the Spaniard's lank neck. Not unaffected by the close sight of the gleaming steel, Don Benito nervously shuddered; his usual ghastliness was heightened by the lather, which lather, again, was intensified in its hue by the contrasting sootiness of the negro's body. Altogether the scene was somewhat peculiar, at least to Captain Delano, nor, as he saw the two thus postured, could he resist <b>the</b> <b>vagary,</b> that in <b>the</b> black he saw a headsman, and in the white {{a man at the}} block. But {{this was one of those}} antic conceits, appearing and vanishing in a breath, from which, perhaps, the best regulated mind is not always free.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} is highly labor intensive, and each hectare requires {{a high degree}} of maintenance throughout the year.

5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built.
