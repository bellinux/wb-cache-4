One of the challenging tasks is the analysis of intact and underivatized lipids, which have various important functions in organism (energy storage, membrane building block, cellular signalling, precursor of relevant biomolecules etc.). The lipid composition consists of different, structural diverse lipid classes with several subclasses including numerous lipid species. These species vary in chain length, degree of saturation and/or kind of bonding of the attached fatty acid(s). Anomalous lipid compositions were correlated to different diseases like diabetes and many others. In the present work a hyphenated approach consisting of different separation (SPE, HPLC) and analytical techniques (MS, NMR) was applied for the investigation of lipids in body fluids. Such an approach combines {{the advantages of the}} different techniques resulting in increased selectivity, sensitivity and structure elucidation power. The thesis shows the way from finding a suitable lipid extraction method to the identification of individual lipid species in blood plasma and serum samples with a main focus on method development and optimization.

40|$|Plant {{resistance}} against the necrotrophic pathogen Plectosphaerella cucumerina is mediated {{by a combination}} of several hormonal-controlled signalling pathways. The priming agent β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) is able to induce effective {{resistance against}} this pathogen by stimulating callose-rich cell wall depositions. In the present research it is demonstrated that BABA-Induced Resistance (BABA-IR) against P. cucumerina in Arabidopsis has additional components such as the induction of defences mediated by indolic derivatives. Chromatographic approach for the detection and characterization of metabolites enhanced by BABA compared with water-treated plants only when the challenge is present has been developed. The metabolites matching this criteria are considered to be primed by BABA. <b>The</b> <b>analytic</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> combination of liquid chromatography (LC) with a triple quadrupole (TQD) detector in a precursor ion scanning mode.

A subsequent exact mass analysis in a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer demonstrated that this ion was the indole-derivative metabolite indole- 3 -carboxylic acid (I 3 CA). The identity of indole- 3 -carboxilic acid was definitively confirmed by comparing its retention time and fragmentation spectra with a commercial standard. Quantification of I 3 CA in primed plants showed that this indolic metabolite is specifically primed by BABA upon P. cucumerina infection, while other indolic compounds such as IAA and camalexin are not.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore and understand participation in dance, rhythm and music activities for healthy elderly persons and for persons who have had a stroke. The specific aim of Study 1 was to develop knowledge of elderly persons’ experiences of participating in an improvisational dance workshop. Data was collected by interviewing 13 persons. To capture participants’ experiences, open-ended questions were used to make it possible for participants to bring up issues of relevance for themselves. A narrative method was used to analyze data. Findings show that participation led to “a surprising awareness about the connection between body and mind” and that “participation led to personal growth”. Further results showed how participation in a physical activity such as creative improvisational dance opened possibilities to interpret the lives the informants had lived, which in turn made it possible for them to come to terms with the past, leading to increased perceived quality of life. The aim of Study 2 was to investigate how stroke patients understand participation in Ronnie Gardiner Rhythm and Music (RGRM) therapy. Data was collected by interviewing 18 persons with stroke. <b>The</b> <b>analytic</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> carried out with a phenomenographic approach.

Conventional voltage versus time plots of the responses were found inadequate as a means of making qualitative studies of such a large data space.

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} reading process as {{addressed}} by Davies and Wallace in their research. The key {{concept of the}} models of the reading process as explored by Davies with reference to different researchers are examined. These researchers include Gough, whose model of the reading process represents a bottom-up view of the reading process, Goodman's model which reflects a top-down view of the reading process and Rumelhart's interactive model which is an alternative to bottom-up and top-down models. Davies advances a schema-theory which {{is the development of}} Rumelhart's interactive model. The study also considers the model of Rayner and Pollatsek as proposed by Davies, namely, the bottom-up interactive model of the reading process. This model intends to be bottom-up, without excluding the interactive features. A further model explored by Davies is that of Mathewson, which incorporates affective factors in reading. Hedge, according to Davies, developed the models of reading into a taxonomy of modes, anchors and drivers. Modes represent the reading behaviours, anchors express knowledge sources, and drivers typify the reading purposes. The study also considers Wallace's approach to the reading process, which represents reading as a psycholinguistic as well as a sociolinguistic process. In addition, this study conducts an investigation of a practical framework for describing and analysing texts; ways of describing differences amongst texts as proposed by Wallace and the integration of different descriptions of texts. Levels of text analysis and the theoretical foundation of <b>the</b> <b>analytic</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>are</b> considered. <b>The</b> last part of this discussion provides some perspectives on reaching reading in the outcomes-based curriculum for language, literacy and communication (see Appendix B). In the next part of the study an analysis of the Xhosa Bona magazine articles is offered which commences with the recapitulation of the framework for the analysis of texts. This framework includes elements such as the discourse type and genre; textual units and their functions; rhetorical functions and rhetorical patterns; text cohesion; text coherence and language choice as a reflection of the writer's communicative purpose or goal. Each article is analysed according to the framework assumed. The study invokes Davies' <b>analytic</b> framework for <b>the</b> analysis of the Bona magazine articles. The last part of this research explores the significance between Davies' model and the requirements of outcomes-based language teaching. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die studie ondersoek 'n praktiese raamwerk vir die beskrywing en analise van tekste, maniere vir die beskrywing van verskille tussen tekste soos voorgestel deur Wallace, en die integrasie van die verskillende beskrywings van tekste. Die vlakke van teksanalise en die teoretiese basis van die analitiese prosedure word bespreek. Die laaste deel van hierdie bespreking skenk aandag aan perspektiewe oor die onderrig van leesvaardigheid in die Uitkoms-gebaseerde kurrikulum vir die leerveld tale, geletterdheid en kommunikasie (sien Bylae B). In die volgende deel van die studie word 'n analise gedoen van Xhosa BONA tydskrifartikels, wat begin met 'n rekapitulasie van die raamwerk vir die analise van tekste. Hierdie raamwerk sluit elemente in soos diskoerstipe en genre, retoriese funksies en taalkeuse as 'n refleksie van die skrywer se kommunikatiewe doelstellings. Elke artikel word ontleed volgens die analitiese raamwerk van Davies. Die laaste deel van die studie ondersoek die verband en betekenis van Davies se leesmodel vir die onderrig van lees volgens die vereistes van die Uitkoms-gebaseerde kurrikulum. ISICATSHULWA: Esi sifundo sijongene nophando ngendlela yokufunda njengoko indululwe ngokaDavies noWallace kwiincwadi zabo. Le ngqikelelo yemifuziselo yofundo njengoko iphononongwa ngulo kaDavies ngokubhekisele le ke kwizimvo zabacebi, nayo iyahlolwa kwesi sifundo. Aba bacebi bale mifuziselo yale ngqikelelo yofundo ngaba balandelayo; okaGough, omfuziselo wakhe wofundo ubonisa ukuba ufundo luqala phantsi luye phezulu oko kukuthi, phantsi-phezulu, kanti yena uGoodman uqikelela ufundo njengento eqala phezulu iye phantsi, oko kukuthi, phezulu-phantsi. Kukho ke noluvo lokaRumelhart malunga nolu qikelelo-fundo. Vena uceba ufundo okanye umfuziselo wofundo osebenzisanayo, futhi oluyenye indlela endaweni yezi zimbini zit hi phantsi-phezulu okanye phezulu-phantsi. Ngaphaya koko, uDavies uvelisa enye indlela ekwacetywa nguRumelhart, athi ukuyibiza yinkcazo-ngcingane (theory) yeskima. Yona ikhulisa ikwaqhubela phambili le yomfuziselo osebenzisanayo (interactive model). Isifundo esi sikwaluthathela ingqalelo uluvo lukaRayner noPollatsek ngokuphakanyiswa nguDavies, olu ke lokuba bacebe inkqubo yofundo oluqala phantsi luye phezulu luze luhlangane nolu lukaRumelhart lokusebenzisana. Injongo yale nkqubo yofundo lwabo kukuba baqiniseke ngofundo oluqala phantsi luye phezulu phofu bengakhange nakancinane balahle ezo mpawu zolo fundo losebenziswano. Omnye umfuziselo wofundo owaziswa nguDavies ngokaMathewson. Wona ke ubandakanya iimeko ezichukumisayo xeshikweni ubani afundayo (affective factors). UDavies ukwasichazela nangoluvo lukaHedge othe yena le mifuziselo (models) yokufunda wayihlela ngokwezintlu azibiza ngokuba ziindlela zokuziphatha xa ufundayo (modes) okanye (reading behaviours), neeankile (anchors) ezithetha indawo apho ubani afumana khona ulwazi (knowledge sources) kunye nezo athi ngabaqhubi (drivers). Zona ke zibonisa iinjongo zokuba ubani afunde oko asukuba ekufunda. OkaWallace ufundo olu ulubonisa ngeyakhe indlela eyahlukileyo kwabanye aba. Ulubona njengenkqubo ehlanganisa inzululwazi ngezengqondo edibaniselene nenzululwazi ngezolwimi, edibeneyo (unitary) nekhethayo (and selective), kunye naleyo inenzululwazi ngoluntu neelwimi (sociolinguistic). Ukongeza apho isifundo esi siphonononga indlela ephathekayo yokuchaza nokucazulula okubhaliweyo (text analysis); iindlela ezahlukeneyo zokuchaza umahluko phakathi kwezinto ezibhaliweyo. Oku ke kudibene nezimvo ezivela kokaWallace. Ukuhlanganiswa kwezi ndlela zahlukeneyo zokuchaza okubhaliweyo; imigangatho yokubhaliweyo (levels of text); eyiyeyona isetyenziswayo nefundwa ngokubanzi jikelele; isiseko (basic) senkcazo eyingcingane senkqubo yocazululo kwakunye ke nokuveliswa kweendlela ezimisiweyo ezahlukeneyo zolu calulo lokubhaliweyo, zonke zikhankanyiwe kwesi sifundo. Indawo yokugqibela yolu phando inika iinkcazelo ngamagama athile (terms) afumaneka kufundo ngeelwimi olubhekiselele kwiziqhamo zokufundwayo (outcomes-based language study). Emveni koku ke ngoku kulandela ucazululo-ncakasana lwamanqaku omhleli kalindixesha wesiXhosa ekuthiwa yiBona, cazululo 010 oluqala ngokuwenza amavandlakanya ngendlela lo kaDavies aceba ngayo ucazululo lokubhaliweyo. Le ndlela ke yile ilandelayo; idiskhosi nejenra; iziqwengana zentetho ebhaliweyo (textual units) nemisebenzi yazo; imisebenzi yeentetho zobuciko (rhetorical functions), neendlela zobuciko (rhetorical patterns); ukunxibelelana nokuyondelelana kokubhaliweyo (text coherence and text cohesion); nokhetho magamallwimi ngendlela yokubonisa iinjongo nomyalezo wombhali (language choices as a reflection of the writer's communicative goal and purpose). Inqakwana (article) ngalinye kula sesithethe ngawo ngentla apha, licazululwa ngokwale ndlela ixeliweyo endululwe ngulo kaDavies. Ngaphandle koko isifundo esi sihlola unxibelelwano phakathi kwendlela yocazululo lokubhaliweyo ecetywa nguDavies kunye nendlela athe la manqaku eBona acazululwa ngayo. Ekugqibeleni kwako konke uphando olu luthabatha ingqalelo kumcimbi wonxibelelwano phakathi kwendlela le kaDavies yocazululo nocalulo lokubhaliweyo kunye nofundiso lolwimi olujongene neziqhamo zokufundwayo (outcomes-based language teaching) ...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Industrial Psychology and People Management) The present {{investigation}} is positioned {{at a crucial}} juncture {{in the field of}} positive psychology where considerable enthusiasm has seen a growing proliferation in research and practice that has outstripped the ability of the field to maintain a sense of meta-theoretical integrity and domain identity. In this study a meta-theoretical taxonomy of positive psychology is developed {{in order to meet the}} pressing need for sound meta-theoretical integration that is necessary to facilitate a multiplicity of possible futures for the field of positive psychology. This proposed meta-theoretical taxonomy delimits the dominant constructs in the field according to the taxonomical components of (1) Positive Characteristics, (2) Healthy Processes, and (3) Positive Outcomes. The utility of the developed meta-theoretical taxonomy in organizing dominant constructs within the field informs the central research problem. This problem is addressed by identifying 33 dominant positive psychology constructs, grouping them according to the theoretical principles of the proposed taxonomy, and then empirically examining whether the theoretical organization has utility in explaining latent factor structures and loadings of data for these constructs in the research sample. The research sample employed consisted of 904 undergraduate students at the University of Johannesburg. There were 694 women, 208 men and two individuals with undeclared gender in the sample. These participants represented a diversity of self-declared ethnicities: Black (630), Coloured (59), Indian / Asian (47), and White (164). Within the sample there were 19 different home languages that can be summarized as: Afrikaans (47), English (258), Indigenous South African (588), and other (9). In order to compare the theoretical organization of the 33 dominant constructs with empirically determined data, a 483 item questionnaire was developed and refined using Rasch modelling. The development of the measure of the identified constructs was informed by contemporary theory and measurement pertaining to each of the specific constructs. Following the refined measurement of <b>the</b> constructs, factor <b>analytic</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> used to determine latent factor structures for the 33 constructs. The latent factor structure and factor loadings of the specific constructs were then compared with the theorized organization determined by the proposed model. The central finding of the {{present investigation}} is that the theorized taxonomy is able to account for a deep theoretical conceptualization as to the functioning of the facets of the identified dominant constructs. This greater insight into the functioning and structure of the constructs within the field of positive psychology has profound implications for the manner in which constructs can be understood and for the manner in which these constructs can be elicited and practiced. Collectively, the meta-theoretical components of (1) Positive Characteristics, (2) Healthy Processes, and (3) Positive Outcomes represent an important meta-synthesis that serves to meet the pressing call for the firm theoretical integration necessary to secure an array of sustainable futures within the field of positive psychology...|$|R
