40|$|The present {{project was}} {{conceived}} as a fundamental study {{of the interaction between}} oxygen jet and liquid metal bath and the effect of bottom blowing on the interaction in the combined blowing BOF steelmaking processes with respect to droplet generation due to the jet impingement, the droplet size distribution and the droplet residence time. Mechanisms of droplet generation and mechanisms of the effect of bottom blowing on droplet generation were investigated in a 2 -D water model, using high speed cinephotography. Two mechanisms of the droplet generation, 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 swanning 2 ̆ 2, were found, corresponding to low and high jet gas flow rates respectively. Ejection of individual droplets and liquid fragments are characteristics of the 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 swarming 2 ̆ 2 regions respectively. It was found that the significant increase in the droplet production due to bottom blowing is principally caused by the interaction between the top and bottom blowing in the impingement zone, and not by the bottom blowing as such. The droplet production, droplet size distribution and droplet residence time were experimentally studied {{in a wide range of}} blowing parameters such as gas flow rates through top lance and <b>bottom</b> <b>tuyeres,</b> lance height and <b>bottom</b> <b>tuyere</b> location etc., using 2 -D and 3 -D water modelling and 3 -D mercury/glycerine modelling. The relationship between those three phenomena and the blowing conditions were established. The evidence obtained from this study suggests that there is a strong indication to take the momentum number as a link between the model and the prototype in terms of droplet generation due to an impinging gas jet. All findings from this study can be explained based on the 2 ̆ 2 ripple theory 2 ̆ 2 of the generation recommended from this work...|$|R

Process of copper reduction with natural gas as performed in the anode furnace was modeled. Numerical analysis was conducted using the IPSA (Inter- Phase-Slip Algorithm) module of PHOENICS package and standard turbulent model k - ε. The model takes into account the liquid phase - slag and phase of natural gas which is supplied through the <b>tuyere</b> from the <b>bottom</b> of the charge. Calculations were made for two different diameters of tuyeres for supply of reducer. Based on the calculations and analysis, it was found out that the gas flow which causes strong movement in the bath guarantees homogeneous composition of the liquid copper in each process stage. Application of a tuyere with a larger diameter results in a greater intensity of the reduction process and better use of the reducer...|$|R

The minecart used is an original (in 1931 minecarts were replaced by trucks). A slag-extraction workplace has also been recreated, showing a sieve rebuilt identical to an original model.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process to}} recover steel plant waste oxides {{to be used in}} the production of hot metal. The process flowsheet used at the pilot plant. Coal/coke breeze and iron ore pellets/waste oxides are charged into the smelting reactor. The waste oxides are either agglomerated into briquettes (1 inch) using a binder or micro-agglomerated into pellets (1 / 4 inch) without the use of a binder. The iron oxides dissolve in the slag and are reduced by carbon to produce molten iron. The gangue oxides present in the raw materials report to the slag. Coal charged to the smelter is both the fuel as well as the reductant. Carbon present in the waste oxides is also used as the fuel/reductant resulting in a decrease in the coal requirement. Oxygen is top blown through a central, water-cooled, dual circuit lance. Nitrogen is injected through <b>tuyeres</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the reactor for stirring purposes. The hot metal and slag produced in the smelting reactor are tapped at regular intervals through a single taphole using a mudgun and drill system. The energy requirements of the process are provided by (i) the combustion of carbon to carbon monoxide, referred to as primary combustion and (ii) the combustion of CO and H{sub 2 } to CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O, known as postcombustion...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{mathematical}} models to explore the mixing and its related phenomena in converter bath. Specifically, first, a mathematical model of a physical model converter, which was scaled down to 1 / 6 th of a 30 t vessel, was developed in this study. A number of parameters were studied and their effects on the mixing time were recorded in a top blown converter. Second, a mathematical model for a combined top-bottom blown was built to investigate the optimization process. Then, a side tuyere was introduced in the combined top-bottom blown converter and its effects on the mixing and wall shear stress were studied. Moreover, based on the above results, the kinetic energy transfer phenomena in a real converter were investigated by applying the mathematical models. A simplified model, in which the calculation region was reduced to save calculation compared to simulations of the whole region of the converter, was used in the mathematical simulation. In addition, this method was also used in the simulation of real converters. This approach makes it possible to simulate the Laval nozzle flow jet and the cavity separately when using different turbulence models. In the top blown converter model, a comparison between the physical model and the mathematical model showed a good relative difference of 2. 5 % and 6. 1 % for the cavity depth and radius, respectively. In addition, the predicted mixing time showed a good relative difference of 2. 8 % in comparison to the experimental data. In an optimization of a combined top-bottom blown converter, a new <b>bottom</b> <b>tuyere</b> scheme with an asymmetrical configuration was found to be one of the best cases with respect to a decreased mixing time in the bath. An industrial investigation showed that the application effects of the new tuyere scheme yield a better stirring condition in the bath compared to the original case. Furthermore, the results indicated that the mixing time for a combined top-bottom-side blown converter was decreased profoundly compared to a conventional combined top-bottom blown converter. It was found that the side wall shear stress is increased by introducing side blowing, especially in the region near the side blowing plume. For a 100 t converter in real, the fundamental aspects of kinetic energy transfer from a top and bottom gas to the bath were explored. The analyses revealed that the energy transfer is less efficient when the top lance height is lowered or the flowrate is increased in the top blowing operations. However, an inverse trend was found. Namely, that the kinetic energy transfer is increased when the bottom flowrate is increased in the current bottom blowing operations. In addition, the slag on top of the bath is found to dissipate 6. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 11. 2 % for the slag masses 5, 9 and 15 t compared to the case without slag on top of the surface of the bath, respectively.   QC 20151015 </p...|$|R
