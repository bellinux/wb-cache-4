25|$|When {{an index}} has been {{normalized}} in this manner, {{the meaning of}} the number 112, for instance, is that the total cost for <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> goods is 4% more in 2001, 8% more in 2002 and 12% more in 2003 than in the base year (in this case, year 2000).|$|E

25|$|While {{the poverty}} {{threshold}} is updated for inflation every year, <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> food {{used to determine}} what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated since 1955. As a result, the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago, updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index. When methods similar to Orshansky's were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier, {{it was found that}} the poverty line should actually be 200% higher than the official level being used by the government in that year.|$|E
25|$|Later one rescuer found {{a direct}} {{route to the}} trapped miners, across the rubble in the side tunnel, {{and was able to}} get close enough to <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> the {{telehandler}} to shake Russell's hand. This was where a remote-controlled loader had got {{to the back of the}} teleloader, but this route was deemed unsafe for rescuing them. Webb and Russell themselves did not want the rescuers to attempt to reach them through the rubble, because to do so would require them to cut through the wire on the side of the cage, which was under considerable pressure from the rock above. The two men were afraid that cutting the cage would cause it to collapse.|$|E
25|$|Nearly forty {{versions}} of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder made by pupils and followers of Leonardo survive today. Many show elements which were discarded as the prime version, or versions, evolved {{over a long period}} of time. Some include the figure group in the middle ground visible in the Buccleuch and Lansdowne underdrawings; others show <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> wool described by Fra Pietro da Novellara, though to Christ’s side rather than beneath his foot. Eight paintings, including the copy in the Louvre, show a different kind of rocky outcrop in the foreground from those in the prime versions; many of these are probably by Lombard Leonardeschi. Some artists elaborated on Leonardo’s composition with the addition of still lives or extra figures.|$|E

25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a broker-dealer. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> assets.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum is}} most {{famous for its}} {{collections}} of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist paintings, widely {{regarded as one of}} the finest collections outside of France. Highlights include more than 30 paintings by Claude Monet, including six of his Haystacks and a number of Water Lilies. Also in the collection are important works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir such as Two Sisters (On the Terrace), and Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day. Post-Impressionist works include Paul Cézanne's <b>The</b> <b>Basket</b> <b>of</b> Apples, and Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair. At the Moulin Rouge by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is another highlight. The pointillist masterpiece, which also inspired a musical and was famously featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Georges Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte—1884, is prominently displayed. Additionally, Henri Matisse's Bathers by a River, is an important example of his work. Highlights of non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include Vincent van Gogh's Bedroom in Arles and ,1887.|$|E
500|$|Another {{characteristic}} feature was {{his ability}} to hold a chord in the lower strings while bending an upper string—often bending up from a semitone below a chord note. These can be heard clearly on songs such as [...] "Reynardine" [...] where the bends are from the diminished fifth to the perfect fifth. Jansch often fitted the accompaniment to the natural rhythm of the words of his songs, rather than playing a consistent rhythm throughout. This can lead to occasional bars appearing in unusual time signatures. For example, {{his version of the}} Ewan MacColl song [...] "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", unlike most other covers of that song, switches from 4/4 time to 3/4 and 5/4. A similar disregard for conventional time signatures is found in several of his collaborative compositions with Pentangle: for instance, [...] "Light Flight" [...] from <b>the</b> <b>Basket</b> <b>of</b> Light album includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4 time.|$|E
50|$|In the warfare that {{followed}} engagements occurred all over Connacht, from Turlough in County Mayo to Meelick in County Galway.

500|$|In erasing Gao, Dong {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> pink chrysanthemums {{which stands}} at the officials' feet, and completed the depiction of [...] Yongdingmen gate, in the original seen only in part behind Gao. [...] He was forced to expand the section of sky seen above the people assembled in Tiananmen Square, which affected the placement of Mao {{as the center of}} attention. [...] He compensated for this, to some extent, by adding two more microphones to Mao's right. Julia Andrews, in her book on the art of the People's Republic, suggested that Dong's solution was not entirely satisfactory as the microphones dominate the center of the painting, and Mao is diminished by the expanded space around him. [...] The modified painting was shown in the 1955 exhibition, and in 1958 in Moscow. [...] Although the painting was later altered again and does not exist in this form, this version is the one most commonly reproduced.|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, and yet you do not understand?" ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} innovation was {{the shift}} key, introduced with the Remington No. 2 in 1878.

[...] Either mechanism caused a different portion of the typebar to come in contact with the ribbon/platen. [...] The result is that each typebar could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half (and simplifying the internal mechanisms considerably). The obvious use for this was to allow letter keys to type both upper and lower case, but normally the number keys were also duplexed, allowing access to special symbols such as percent (%) and ampersand (&).|$|E
50|$|Some {{split share}} {{corporations}} provide an exchange mechanism, in which {{units of the}} split share corporation can be converted into shares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> shares, and vice versa.
