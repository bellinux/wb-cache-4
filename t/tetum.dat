25|$|A {{pretext for}} the crisis {{came from the}} {{management}} of a dispute within the military of East Timor (F-FDTL), when soldiers from {{the western part of}} the country claimed that they were being discriminated against, in favour of soldiers from the eastern part of the country. The Lorosae (<b>Tetum</b> for easterners) formed the largest part of Falintil, the guerrilla resistance movement which had resisted Indonesian authority, and which in turn, after final independence in 2002, formed the largest part of F-FDTL. In contrast the Loromonu (<b>Tetum</b> for westerners) were less prominent in the resistance, and less favoured in the military structure. There had also been tension between the military and the police force, which was composed of more westerners and also some former members of the Indonesian military.|$|E
