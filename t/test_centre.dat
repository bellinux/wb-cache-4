Although uncertain, it is assumed that Handke was Schnaufer's radio and radar operator on this mission. Bomber Command had targeted Peenemünde and the V-weapons <b>test</b> <b>centre</b> that night. Schnaufer, who had been tasked with leading one of the first Zahme Sau missions under Y-Control, had to abort the mission early due to engine trouble.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} XP-9, marked A 028-386, {{was first}} flown on 18 November 1930. It had impressive stats on the specification sheet, but {{it quickly became}} apparent that its large (6ft chord) wing, which was placed atop the fuselage {{directly in front of}} the pilot, obstructed downward visibility so badly that simple landing maneuvers were hazardous. Test pilots at the Army <b>Test</b> <b>Centre</b> at Wright Field found that the XP-9's inherent instability was so severe that immediate modifications were requested to increase the size of the vertical tail. An enlarged vertical tail surface with smooth metal skinning was introduced, but failed to effect any significant improvement, and this revised XP-9 was grounded for instructional airframe use in August 1931, after only 15 hours of test flying.|$|E

25|$|In August 1942, Hawker’s {{second test}} pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while {{deputising}} for Chief Test Pilot Philip Lucas, {{carried out a}} straight and level speed test from Hawker’s <b>test</b> <b>centre</b> at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around {{the tail of the}} aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up {{to the end of the}} Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its sleeve valves, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing.|$|E
500|$|In January 1943, {{a variety}} of Ju 87 Ds became [...] "test beds" [...] for the Ju 87 G variants. At the start of 1943, the coastal Luftwaffe Erprobungsstelle <b>test</b> <b>centre</b> at Tarnewitz tested this {{combination}} from a static position. Oberst G. Wolfgang Vorwald noted the experiments were not successful, and suggested the cannon be installed on the Messerschmitt Me 410. However, testing continued, and on 31 January 1943, Ju 87 D-1 W.Nr 2552 was tested by Hauptmann Hans-Karl Stepp near the Briansk training area. Stepp noted the increase in drag, which reduced the aircraft's speed to [...] Stepp {{also noted that the}} aircraft was also less agile than the existing D variants.

500|$|In the US, the 1954 {{interceptor}} {{was well}} underway, and would ultimately introduce the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, an aircraft with many similarities to the Arrow. More advanced designs were also being considered, notably the Mach 3 Republic XF-103, {{and by the}} time the Arrow was flying, the much more advanced North American XF-108. Both of these programs were cancelled during the mock-up stage, as it was believed the need for a manned interceptor of very high-performance simply did not exist as the Soviets were clearly moving their strategic force to ICBMs. This argument added weight to the justification of cancelling the Arrow. In 1958, Avro Aircraft Limited president and general manager Fred Smye elicited a promise from the USAF to [...] "supply, free, the fire control system and missiles and if they would allow the free use of their flight <b>test</b> <b>centre</b> at...
