5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic before entering the eastern Pacific on October8. Despite strong easterly wind shear, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October15. Within a broad cyclonic gyre, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> moved erratically, first drifting south then east-northeast and eventually northwest. Early on October16, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation, but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and <b>the</b> <b>system</b> weakened to a tropical depression by 1800UTC. After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day, a brief reprieve in harsh upper-level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991mb (hPa; 29.27inHg). An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable airmass caused <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October23; <b>the</b> <b>system</b> degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later. The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October27.|$|E
5|$|An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September13, in {{association}} with the monsoon trough. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft. Late on September14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge. At 03:00UTC on September15, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> giving it the local name Inday. Nine hours later, the JMA named <b>the</b> <b>system</b> Tropical Storm Fanapi.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> provided {{a more favorable}} environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to <b>the</b> <b>system</b> developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

5|$|At the time, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind <b>the</b> <b>system</b> until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after {{a burst of}} deep convection over the center. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours.

5|$|In early April, {{the monsoon}} trough {{established}} itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough {{developed in the}} Caroline Islands on April 9, and resembled {{the characteristics of a}} monsoon depression. Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> <b>system</b> drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; <b>the</b> <b>system</b> underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. On April 11, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> maintained a persistent area of well-organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800UTC on April 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105km (65mi) of Pohnpei. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) simultaneously classified <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as a tropical depression, and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13.|$|E
5|$|In late October1991, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed near the Caroline Islands. Tracking generally west-northwestward, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> gradually became more defined. On October31, convection associated with <b>the</b> <b>system</b> quickly increased, prompting {{the issuance of}} a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Early on November1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as {{a tropical}} depression, at which time <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was situated roughly 415km (260mi) north-northeast of Palau. Following a satellite-derived surface wind estimate of 45km/h (30mph) later that day, the JTWC also began monitoring the low as a tropical depression. Initially, forecast models showed <b>the</b> <b>system</b> continuing on an arcing path out to sea; however, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> turned westward on November2 and threatened the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Uring. Late on November3, the depression turned west-southwestward towards the Visayas {{in response to an}} approaching cold front, an event typical of late-season cyclones in the basin. On November4, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to a tropical storm, with the latter assigning it the name Thelma.|$|E
5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep {{convection}} consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation and convective banding features developed along the periphery of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled as <b>the</b> <b>system</b> rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as <b>the</b> <b>system</b> detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} day <b>the</b> <b>system</b> moved north-westwards and {{gradually}} developed further, before the JMA reported that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had developed into a tropical storm and named it Bavi during March 11. Later that day as the system's low level circulation centre continued to consolidated and deep convection wrapped into it, the JTWC initiated advisories and designated <b>the</b> <b>system</b> as 03W. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> subsequently continued to gradually intensify as it moved westwards, around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure located to the northwest of <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> During March 14, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> peaked as a tropical storm with the JMA reporting 10-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph), while the JTWC reported 1-minute sustained winds of 95km/h (60mph). By this time <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was approaching the Mariana islands and had started to weaken, with system's low level circulation becoming partially exposed and displaced from the atmospheric convection.
