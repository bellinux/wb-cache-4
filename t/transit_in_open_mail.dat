40|$|The Survey for <b>Transiting</b> Extrasolar Planets <b>in</b> Stellar Systems (STEPSS) {{project is}} a search for {{planetary}} <b>transits</b> <b>in</b> <b>open</b> clusters. <b>In</b> this paper, we analyze the STEPSS observations of the open cluster NGC 1245 to determine the variable star content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22, of which ∼ 870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear intrinsic variability that are potential cluster members, and 29 clear variables that are not cluster members. None of these variables have been previously identified. We present light curves, finding charts, and stellar/photometric data on these variable objects. Several of the interacting binaries have estimated distances consistent with the cluster distance determined from isochrone fits to the color magnitude diagram. Four stars at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster have light curves consistent with γ Doradus variability. If these γ Doradus candidates are confirmed, they represent the oldest and coolest members of this class of variable discovered to date. Subject headings: 1...|$|R

We present {{preliminary}} photometric {{results of}} a monitoring study of the open cluster NGC 2660 {{as part of the}} EXPLORE/OC project to find planetary <b>transits</b> <b>in</b> Galactic <b>open</b> clusters. Analyzing a total of 21000 stars (3000 stars with photometry to 1 % or better) yielded three light curves with low-amplitude signals like those typically expected for transiting hot Jupiters. Although their eclipses are most likely caused by non-planetary companions, our methods and photometric precision illustrate the potential to detect planetary <b>transits</b> around stars <b>in</b> nearby <b>open</b> clusters...|$|R
