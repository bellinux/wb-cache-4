5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{occurred after}} Spielmann, Hunt, and Lucas published a 2006 paper mentioning that the holotype of Redondasuchus {{was not a}} left paramedian but a right one.

5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, implying <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard {{and leader of}} the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment must allow for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, there is no indication <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E

5|$|During the 14th century, {{however, the}} castle had {{declined}} and became abandoned. In 1398 Richard II had the lead {{taken from the}} castle roofs for reuse at Portchester Castle.

5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.
