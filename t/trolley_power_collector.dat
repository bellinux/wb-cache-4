2500|$|Most {{interurban}} railways in North America {{were constructed}} {{using the same}} low-voltage 500 to 600 V DC [...] <b>trolley</b> <b>power</b> in use by the street railways to which they connected. This enabled interurban cars {{to use the same}} overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>power</b> on town street car tracks with no electrical change on the cars to accommodate a different voltage. However, higher voltage became necessary to reduce power loss on long-distance routes, though substations were established to boost voltage. In 1904, a high voltage single-phase alternating current (AC) system where AC was delivered directly to the interurban car became available and was promoted and distributed by Westinghouse and competitor General Electric. Both 3300 and 6600 V AC were used. However, AC systems proved expensive to maintain and were not widely adopted.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} concept for an ISS-based optical system {{assembly}} demonstration designed to advance technologies related to future large in-space optical facilities deployment, including space solar <b>power</b> <b>collectors</b> and large-aperture astronomy telescopes. The large solar <b>power</b> <b>collector</b> {{problem is not}} unlike the large astronomical telescope problem, but at least conceptually it should be easier in principle, given the tolerances involved. We strive in this application to leverage heavily the work done on the NASA Optical Testbed Integration on ISS Experiment (OpTIIX) effort to erect a 1. 5 m imaging telescope on the International Space Station (ISS). Specifically, we examine a robotic assembly sequence for constructing a large (meter diameter) slightly aspheric or spherical primary reflector, comprised of hexagonal mirror segments affixed to a lightweight rigidizing backplane structure. This approach, together with a structured robot assembler, will {{be shown to be}} scalable to the area and areal densities required for large-scale solar concentrator arrays...|$|R

50|$|The New Haven {{considered}} {{two different}} operating frequencies {{for use in}} their electrification: 15 Hz and 25 Hz. The lower frequency of 15 Hz afforded reduced motor size, lower inductive losses, and a higher motor power factor. 25 Hz had by 1907 already become a commercial standard, and the railroad already operated a number of <b>trolley</b> <b>power</b> houses at 25 Hz and had equipped many of its shops with 25 Hz motors. Selection of 15 Hz viewed by the railroad as a 'break in gage' which would have limited the commercial value of the system. Thus the railroad selected the 25 Hz standard, even though {{it might have been}} more desirable from an engineering perspective. Note that many European railroads standardized on a 16.7 Hz traction power frequency.|$|R

This paper presents parametric studies aimed at determining the power concentration capacity of a non-ideally reflecting flat circular membrane as a function of its radius size and thickness.

40|$|Large {{structures}} in space are an essential milestone {{in the path}} of many projects, from solar <b>power</b> <b>collectors</b> to space stations. In space, as on Earth, these large projects may be split in to more manageable sections, dividing the task into multiple replicable parts. Specially constructed spider robots could assemble these structures piece by piece over a membrane or space-web, giving a method for building a structure while on orbit. The modelling and applications of these space-webs are discussed, along with the derivation of the equations of motion of the structure. The presentation of some preliminary results from the solution of these equations will show that space-webs can take a variety of different forms, and give some guidelines for configuring the space-web system...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{missions}} {{for the space}} shuttle were proposed which involve placing large truss platforms on-orbit. These platforms {{range in size from}} tens of meters in span for reflector application to several thousand meters for solar <b>power</b> <b>collector</b> application. These proposed sizes and the operational requirements considered are unconventional in comparison to Earthbound structures and little information exists concerning efficient proportions of the structural elements forming the framework of the platforms. Such proportions are of major concern because they have a strong influence on the packaging efficiency and, thus, the transportation effectiveness of the shuttle. The present study is undertaken to: (1) identify efficient ranges of application of deployable and erectable platforms configured for shuttle transport to orbit, and (2) determine sensitivity to key parameters of minimum mass deployable and erectable platform designs...|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} use studs. All the systems have a switch in the stud and a means to switch on the stud only while it is covered by the moving vehicle. As at least one stud must {{be covered by the}} collector at all times a long collector is used. The length has to be slightly greater than the maximum distance between any two studs. This collector is known as a skate or ski collector. This type of electrical <b>power</b> <b>collector</b> needs to move in the vertical plane to allow for natural differences in the height of the power supply studs. It is used on some full size tramway systems where {{there is a need for}} overhead wires not to be used, usually in areas of scenic value.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the preliminary {{design of a}} parabolic structure suitable for specific space applications, such as in solar <b>power</b> <b>collector</b> systems, which relies upon the sole use of an initially flat circular membrane rigidly constrained across its perimeter. In particular, the possibility for this concept {{to make use of}} solar pressure as a means of obtaining the intended parabolic curvature is explored. Assuming the membrane´s film as an ideally reflecting surface, parametric studies are conducted in order to determine several parameters of interest as functions of its radius and thickness. In order to do so, a set of numerical simulations are carried out using the finite element code ABAQUS®. It is shown that the shape of the deformed membrane is very close to parabolic, therefore being capable of concentrating sunlight power over a focal plane...|$|R
