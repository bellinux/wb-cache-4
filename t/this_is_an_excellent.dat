25|$|Noteworthy {{additions}} {{include the}} A. A. Cuthbert Herbarium of approximately 5000 specimens, the plant holdings of the Florida State Museum (4711 specimens, including the Herbarium of S. C. Hood), several thousand more S. C. Hood collections, 15770 specimens of lichens, liverworts and mosses collected by Severin Rapp, wood blocks and vouchers of American wood and economic trees from the New York State School of Forestry, George E. Ritchey specimens from the U. S. Plant Introduction Garden, Edward and Robert P. St. John Florida ferns, innumerable West and Arnold collections and those received through inter-institutional exchange. The herbarium also {{benefited from the}} prominent studies of H. Harold Hume (Zephyranthes, Ilex, and Camellia) and William A. Murrill (Crataegus and fungi) and in 1989 Angus K. Gholson, Jr. donated his entire herbarium (15,000 specimens), library and related equipment and supplies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> collection especially rich in its representation of the flora of the Florida Panhandle.|$|E

60|$|All {{the people}} in the church had Bibles on a sloping board before them, in their pews, and when the {{minister}} named the text or read a chapter, they all turned to the place, and looked over. Waldron said he thought that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> plan.|$|R
500|$|Metro complimented the visuals of the remaster, {{saying that}} [...] "The game still doesn't look {{quite as good}} as the last couple of Call Of Duty's, but it's {{extremely}} close. And whatever else you say about it, on a presentational level <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> remaster." [...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed out how it was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying [...] "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster it deserves, and is still impressively entertaining after all these years." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A−, finding that {{it showed the}} series to be [...] "unafraid to be unapologetically weird". VanDerWerff felt that [...] "The Thin White Line" [...] introduced elements of mysticism and the supernatural {{to the character of}} Frank Black, which [...] "presages the weirder direction Morgan and Wong took the show in season two, while still staying roughly consistent with the first season’s more realistic focus". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, comparing it to the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs. Gibron noted that [...] "with a stellar final act and a closing scene that {{has a great deal of}} impact in a very restrained manner, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> installment [...] ". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Thin White Line" [...] five stars out of five, noting that [...] "it's a return to the serial killer format, but it's never been done before with as much verve as it had here". Shearman compared the episode to both The Silence of the Lambs and the works of film director Quentin Tarantino, and felt that the interrogation scene between Black and Hance was [...] "maybe the single best scene in the whole season".|$|E

50|$|Priestley’s {{passion for}} science {{led to an}} {{invitation}} to Bowood House, to tutor the children of Lord Shelburne. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> opportunity, given that Priestley {{did not have the}} money of earlier chemists like Boyle and Cavendish, and would still be free to pursue his own research.|$|R

[...] "It takes 12 {{hours to}} read the book on tape, and it's {{certainly}} abridged - 13 flights in the book are scrunched down to four, {{and the role of the}} girl (played by Rosanna Arquette) is smaller. But the themes of the film are the same as the book." ...|$|R

60|$|We had a {{pleasant}} luncheon, {{and as we}} drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which <b>was</b> barely <b>a</b> mile out of our way, and {{pay a visit to}} Cynthia in her dispensary.

6000|$|The almost {{universal}} habit of batsmen of shouting [...] "Heads!" [...] at whatever height {{from the ground}} the ball may be, is not a little confusing. The average person, on hearing the shout, puts {{his hands over his}} skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Jonas. Jonas {{never would}} dispute. Whenever any body said any {{thing that he}} did not think was correct, he would {{sometimes}} try to explain it; but then, if they persisted, he would generally say [...] "Very well," [...] and that would prevent all dispute. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> way to prevent disputes, or to end them when they are begun.|$|E

6000|$|In {{some places}} the hind wheels are taken off, and sledge runners are fitted to the hind axletree. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> plan; {{it has the}} further {{advantage}} that the wagon settles down into a more horizontal position than before. I have seen timber carried on a wagon down a steep hill by separating the front wheels from the hind ones, lashing a trail (see [...] "Travail" [...] below) or two short poles to the fore axletree, and resting {{one end of the}} timber on the hind axletree, and the other end on the trail.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{difficulty}} {{still in}} this arrangement. The mansion in Hill Street {{was not to}} be let, it was for sale, and the price naturally for such a mansion in such <b>a</b> situation, <b>was</b> considerable; quite beyond the means of Lady Roehampton who had a very ample income, but no capital. This difficulty, however, vanished in a moment. Mr. Sidney Wilton purchased the house; he wanted <b>an</b> investment, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> one; so Lady Roehampton became his tenant.|$|R

Indeed, several anthologies of contemporary texts translated into English <b>were</b> published over <b>this</b> period; more than ever before. This article provides a survey and a quantitative reading of five such anthologies, in order to consider how Brazil (and its literature) <b>is</b> portrayed for <b>a</b> British audience...|$|R

6000|$|And {{thus it is}} {{with the}} saint, and should be with every one that by way of {{profession}} nameth the name of Christ, he should depart from his indwelling sin, with his mind.

Ah! to find a man that really departs from himself, and that draweth the affections of the soul, from the affections and lusts of his flesh is rare thing. (Ezek. 11:19-21) The heart of the most of professors goeth after their detestable lusts, and after their inward abominations. But such shall of the flesh reap corruption,' notwithstanding they name the name of Christ. (Gal. 6:8) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 15 <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> {{commentary}} {{upon that}} part of the Pilgrim's Progress which describes Christiana and her company {{at the foot of the}} hill Difficulty. Greatheart points out the spring at which Christian was refreshed before he began the arduous ascent which led him, in defiance of a persecuting world, to join in church fellowship, allegorically represented by the house Beautiful--'When Christian drank it was clear and good, but now it is dirty; and with the feet of some that are not desirous that pilgrims should here quench their thirst.' After the writing of the first part, and before that of the second, the Act of Uniformity had spread its baleful influence over England. To use Bunyan's words--'The Romish beasts have corrupted the doctrine by treading it down with their feet, and have muddied this water with their own dirt and filthiness.'--See Holy City.--Ed.|$|E
