5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E

25|$|LED {{instruments}} can {{and have}} been used to replace any conventional lighting fixture, and some shows, such as Radiohead's recent tour, have used only LED lighting instruments. Most shows use LEDs only for lighting cycloramas, or as <b>top,</b> <b>side,</b> or back light due to their low throw distance. They can also be used as audience blinders (lights pointed directly at the audience from a low angle).|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Melbourne missed {{what looked}} to be an almost certain finals appearance. In the final round they only needed to beat bottom side Collingwood and Footscray one place ahead needed to lose to <b>top</b> <b>side</b> Carlton. They beat Collingwood at Victoria Park but an {{unexpected}} drawn game between Footscray and Carlton saw them miss fifth position. Had Footscray lost the game, Melbourne's superior percentage would have led them to a fifth spot finish.|$|E

An oblique ridge crosses the interior {{face of the}} scapular blade, extending from the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> near {{the far end of}} the blade to the bottom side near the base of the scapular blade. Finally, each end of the radius exhibits a unique form: the top, or proximal end, has a distinct concave embayment on its posterior face while the bottom, or distal end, is nearly square in shape instead of broadly expanded.|$|E

25|$|According to Māori legend, Aoraki was a {{young boy}} who, along with his three brothers, were the sons of Rakinui, the Sky Father. On their voyage around the Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother, their canoe became {{stranded}} on a reef and tilted. Aoraki and his brothers climbed onto the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> of their canoe. However, the south wind froze them and turned them to stone. Their canoe became the Te Waka o Aoraki, the South Island, and their prows, the Marlborough Sounds. Aoraki, the tallest, became the highest peak, and his brothers created the Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, the Southern Alps.|$|E
25|$|Blackburn Rovers {{continued}} to struggle {{during the early}} years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year's Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a <b>top</b> <b>side</b> in the English league. They were First Division champions in 1911–12 and 1913–14, and F.A Cup winners in 1927–28 with a 3–1 victory against Huddersfield Town, but the F.A Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years.|$|E
25|$|On {{two of his}} {{surviving}} instruments, Cristofori employed {{an unusual}} arrangement of the tuning pins: they are inserted {{all the way through}} their supporting wrest plank. Thus, the tuning hammer is used on the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> of the wrest plank, but the strings are wrapped around the pins on the bottom side. This made it harder to replace broken strings, but it provided two compensating advantages. With the nut (front bridge) inverted as well, the blows of the hammers, coming from below, would seat the strings firmly into place, rather than threatening to displace them. The inverted wrestplank also placed the strings lower in the instrument, permitting smaller and lighter hammers, hence a lighter and more responsive touch.|$|E

25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E
25|$|Prices fetched in the {{secondary}} market for indigenous art works vary widely. Until 2007, the record at auction for an indigenous art work was $778,750 paid in 2003 for a Rover Thomas painting, All That Big Rain Coming from the <b>Top</b> <b>Side.</b> In 2007, a major work by Emily Kngwarreye, Earth's Creation, sold for $1.056 million, a new record that was however eclipsed {{only a few months}} later, when Clifford Possum's epic work Warlugulong was bought for $2.4 million by the National Gallery of Australia. At the same time, however, works by prominent artists but of doubtful provenance were being passed in at auctions. In 2003 there were 97 indigenous Australian artists whose works were being sold at auction in Australia for prices above $5000, with the total auction market worth around $9.5 million. In that year Sotheby's estimated that half of sales were to bidders outside Australia. By 2012, the market had changed, with older works fetching higher prices than contemporary paintings.|$|E
25|$|Warrandyte beat Croydon United in the semi final, a {{team that}} had humbled them in the final round, and faced the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> Wantirna South in the Chandler Shield final. It was uncharted territories for both clubs, and it was Warrandyte that batted first and nervously crawled to 9/120. Steve Pascoe made 42 of them, before a pivotal last wicket stand of 70 between John McCartin and Stan Davis that would go down in folklore. Davis then claimed 5/33 to rout the {{opposition}} for 128, and give the club a 62 run first innings lead midway through the 3rd and final day. Warrandyte looked to then bat out the day and claim a comfortable win, but after collapsing to be all out for 96, Wantirna South had 25 overs to score 159 runs in fading light. Fielding was almost impossible as dark clouds closed {{in on the ground}} and infielders were forced to scream out the direction of the ball to outfielders unable to pick up its flight. Davis refused to appeal against the light, preferring to play the game out to a finish, and when the opposition finished on 8/131, Warrandyte prevailed by 28 runs, claiming their first ever top grade premiership.|$|E

25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (main processor) and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the <b>top</b> <b>side</b> of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, <b>top</b> <b>side</b> tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E
500|$|The {{taphonomy}} (burial and fossilization process) of {{the three}} main Plateosaurus sites—Trossingen, Halberstadt and Frick—is unusual in several ways. All three sites are nearly monospecific assemblages, meaning that they contain practically only one species, which requires very special circumstances. However, shed teeth of theropods have been found at all three sites, as well as remains of the early turtle Proganochelys. Additionally, a partial [...] "prosauropod" [...] skeleton was found in Halberstadt that {{does not belong to}} Plateosaurus, but is preserved in a similar position. All sites yielded almost complete and partial skeletons of Plateosaurus, as well as isolated bones. The partial skeletons tend to include the hind limbs and hips, while parts of the anterior body and neck are rarely found in isolation. The animals were all adults or subadults (nearly adult individuals); no juveniles or hatchlings are known. Complete skeletons and large skeleton parts that include the hind limbs all rest dorsal (<b>top)</b> <b>side</b> up, as do the turtles. Also, they are mostly well-articulated, and the hind limbs are three-dimensionally preserved in a zigzag posture, with the feet often much deeper in the sediment than the hips.|$|E
