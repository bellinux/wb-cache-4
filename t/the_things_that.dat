5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.

5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting is one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, {{to the point that}} at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E

5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get to see all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they hadn't seen {{that were going on}} behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity.

But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning is determined by <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they are about in the external world.

5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up.

60|$|Garnache {{dropped the}} servant's hand and stood back a pace. That counter-blast {{of passion and}} that plain {{speaking}} from a quarter so unexpected served, in part at least, to sober him.

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Spector {{wanted to}} achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create}} a better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Book Three {{shows the}} {{characters}} {{in the aftermath of the}} fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> might have been.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E

Let him do the best he can, and trust the editor to decide whether it will take.|$|R

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also {{went through a lot}} of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

It was criticism breaking bounds.|$|R
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} {{document}} is rather vague and noncommittal. The signatories were concerned with guarding the king's honour {{and the rights of}} the Crown (garder son honeur et les dreits de sa Corounne). There was also a promise to address and correct both <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had been done against that honour and those rights, as well as the past and present oppression of the people (les choses que sont feites avant ces houres countre soen honour et le droit de sa Coronne, et les oppressiouns que ount estre feit et uncore se fount de jour en jour a soen people). Nothing is said about what specifically these things were, but it must be assumed that the target was Gaveston. Bek was given the authority to excommunicate whoever broke the terms of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
