500|$|Olds {{was known}} for the extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) {{handlebar}} moustache he sported in Vietnam. It was a common superstition among airmen to grow a [...] "bulletproof mustache", but Olds also used his as [...] "a gesture of defiance. <b>The</b> <b>kids</b> <b>on</b> base loved it. Most everybody grew a mustache." [...] Olds started the mustache {{in the wake of}} the success of Operation Bolo and let it grow beyond regulation length because [...] "It became the middle finger I couldn't raise in the PR photographs. The mustache became my silent last word in the verbal battles...with higher headquarters on rules, targets, and fighting the war." [...] Returning home, however, marked the end of this flamboyance. When he reported to his first interview with Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, McConnell walked up to him, stuck a finger under his nose and said, [...] "Take it off." [...] Olds replied, [...] "Yes, sir." ...|$|E
500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] was slightly more challenging to animate than other first season episodes due to the laser beam-type effects featured in the final monster fight, which were specifically designed to resemble a low-budget monster movie with poor graphics. The scenes with an instructional guide taking <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>on</b> a fossil hunt were based on real-life arrowhead-digging excursions Parker and Stone went on in Red Rocks Park during their childhood in Colorado. During a scene with Chef and Leonard Maltin driving in a car, actual video footage of Colorado roads is visible through the back window of the car. The footage was shot by a friend of Parker and Stone and used because the animators did not yet know how to create roads in perspective.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're right, Peg, {{only you}} mustn't take it so hard. Things {{will work out}} all right. Homans and I were talking about that to-day. You see, Worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon. But perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters. He will suggest that you elect Homans or me. Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not last.... So, Peg, don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one! That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg! Even if Graves has got all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>on</b> his side, which I doubt, Homans and I are with you. And you can just bet that Worry Arthurs will side with us.... Now run along, for I must study." ...|$|E
