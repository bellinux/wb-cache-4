5|$|According to Historian Alexander Mikaberidze, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Army {{remained}} the finest army of its day {{by a good}} margin.

Each corps of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Army was in fact its own mini-army capable of independent action.|$|E

Lake Jones was an elderly black man who had faithfully served a white family named Howard, both before and after his emancipation from slavery. <b>The</b> <b>Frenches</b> killed Lake Jones by arsenic poisoning, intending to steal his property.

5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially {{taken by surprise}} and were unable to organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling <b>the</b> <b>French</b> to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from <b>the</b> <b>French</b> territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill.

5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to {{war with}} <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Despite {{resistance}} from the Dutch Army and a British expeditionary force, the Dutch Republic was overrun by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> {{in the winter of}} 1794–1795, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> reforming the country into the Batavian Republic, a client state of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> regime. Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to <b>the</b> <b>French.</b> On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 a large French {{expeditionary force}} under General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt, then under the nominal {{control of the}} Ottoman Empire, in an {{extension}} of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. The fleet that had convoyed <b>the</b> <b>French</b> army was anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria, and was discovered there by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson on 1 August. In the ensuing Battle of the Nile <b>the</b> <b>French</b> Mediterranean Fleet was almost totally destroyed, preventing <b>the</b> <b>French</b> forces in Egypt from maintaining regular reinforcement and communication from France and ending the possibility of a wholesale evacuation of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> army.

5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> were at anchor in a strong defensive position. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack the head of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> van, {{taking advantage of a}} favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing <b>the</b> <b>French</b> rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards <b>the</b> <b>French</b> centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside <b>the</b> <b>French</b> flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-1350s that {{military}} operations on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, won an important victory in the Battle of Poitiers. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed <b>the</b> <b>French,</b> but captured <b>the</b> <b>French</b> king, John II and his youngest son, Philip. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> king was in English custody, and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to <b>the</b> <b>French</b> crown originally was genuine, or if it was simply a political ploy meant to put pressure on <b>the</b> <b>French</b> government. Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the Treaty of Brétigny, whereby he renounced his claims to <b>the</b> <b>French</b> throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.|$|E
