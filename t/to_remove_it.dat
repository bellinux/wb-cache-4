5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E

However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky {{graduated}} from The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School in 1987 {{with a degree}} in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His interest in IT security began when his work computer was infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship.

5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b> Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

In Australia the church was the only group with a religious exemption for vaccination as of April 2015; the government said that it planned <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families.

The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it,</b> and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, {{computer}} store owner, {{was killed}} in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed {{in the parking lot}} of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In June, the {{conflict}} escalated {{in the region}} of Banovina, which had been declared a part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina) by that time. Three municipalities in the region—Dvor, Glina and Hrvatska Kostajnica—had predominantly Serb populations, although all of them were inhabited by a substantial number of non-Serbs as well. On 24 June, the Sisak police administration set up a new police station in the village of Kozibrod in the Una River valley, along the Dvor–Hrvatska Kostajnica road. It was manned by two platoons of police and ZNG troops drawn from the Sisak company of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The new station drew a strong reaction from the SAO Krajina authorities, who issued an ultimatum on the same day the police station was set up, demanded its removal and threatened <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> by force unless Croatia complied with their ultimatum.|$|E

At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E

Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had in weeks.|$|E

5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later the decision was made <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>it</b> amid growing casualties.|$|E

The threat is such that even the suspicion of the presence of a submarine means a fleet must commit resources <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> <b>it,</b> as the possible consequences of an undetected submarine are too serious to ignore.
