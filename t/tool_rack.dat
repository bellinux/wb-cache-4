50|$|They are {{interrupted}} {{when they}} hear a squeaking noise. Monk and Rusty look up as a man, Eddie Murdoch (Drew Powell), enters the garage. Acting like he is {{trying not to be}} noticed, Murdoch walks around the cab of the spare fire engine parked in the garage. Rusty walks {{around the back of the}} truck to confront Murdoch. Murdoch promptly grabs a shovel from the <b>tool</b> <b>rack</b> and delivers the luckless Rusty a fatal strike to the head. Monk hears an audible clang. He rushes over to investigate and is promptly attacked by Murdoch with the shovel. After a short struggle, Monk manages to grab the shovel. But as he is about to take a swing, Murdoch grabs a container of cleaning fluid and throws the contents into Monk's face. Monk staggers back against the truck, screaming in agonizing pain, and collapses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} enable robotic surgery without human assistance, a means must be {{developed}} to change tools. As {{part of the larger}} Trauma Pod Project, we developed the <b>Tool</b> <b>Rack</b> Subsystem — an automated <b>tool</b> <b>rack</b> capable of holding, accepting, and dispensing up to 14 tools for the da Vinci TM surgical robot. Borrowing some techniques from industrial automation, we developed a robust system capable of presenting any stored tool in 700 ms or less. Tools are positively retained in a sterilizable carousel in a compliant manner designed to accomodate misalignment during tool exchange. RFID equipment is integrated into the system and the tools so that tools can be inventoried and presented by function or serial number instead of rack position. The resulting device has completed testing and integration into the Trauma Pod system and met all its design requirements. I...|$|E
40|$|Dr Jüri Kermik {{from the}} Design and Craft Programme, Faculty of Arts, was invited guest {{exhibitor}} at the EcoDesign 2011 exhibition in Finland (14 - 18 September). EcoDesign is a prestigious annual event launched in 2009 and held {{as part of}} the Helsinki Design Week. The theme of the 3 rd International EcoDesign was MultiFunction. The exhibition presented ecological and multifunctional furniture from 100 internationally recognized designers from 11 countries including Shigeru Ban, Karim Rashid, Eero Aarnio and Björn Dahlström. Kermik’s design STANDPOINT minimises the amount of material and parts but extends the degree of multifunctionality through detailing, modularity and options for assembly. STANDPOINT utilises only four inter-connectable components for a maximum adjustability. Rather than attempting to define a fixed proposition, Kermik invites the user to create an object to be acted upon. Component parts: four wooden interconnectable and adjustable arms/legs, tray(s) and a box. Compatibles: lampshades, coat hangers, hooks, umbrellas, tools, instruments, clothes, books, maps, flowers, candles etc. Combinations: tripod, easel, stick-leg stand, pedestal, lampstand, crutch, sewing stand, display cabinet, telescope mount, workstand, trestle, plant stand, display stand, deadman, drinks cabinet, cake stand, leg, standard lamp, prop, sawhorse, coat hanger, clothes rack, buttress, music stand, bracket, stick measure, straight edge, mirror stand, notice board, tool box, <b>tool</b> <b>rack,</b> book case, adjustable square, compass, stilt, sign support, gun mount, bookstand, tray stand, magazine rack, key cabinet, valet stand, umbrella stand, candlestand, trivet, navigator’s level...|$|E

50|$|Propellerhead {{released}} Reason 9.2 which added new SDK <b>tools</b> for <b>rack</b> extensions {{developers to}} improve the functionality of their rack extensions and add new features that were unavailable in previous versions of Reason. A new feature in particular allows rack extensions to load audio samples {{in a variety of}} formats. Various developers have released entirely new and/or updated versions of their previous devices to take advantage of these new features such as allowing users of their sample-based synths to create and modify their own custom audio wavetables. Unfortunately, version 9.2 updated extensions will not work in older versions of Reason.|$|R
30|$|In an {{automobile}} assembly line, many processes require control and human intervention. A human’s dexterity {{and ability to}} react to unpredictable changes in production volume and product specifications are necessary for these processes. Thus, it remains difficult to rely on robots or other automated systems. Conversely, some tasks, such as moving to a <b>tool</b> <b>rack</b> and delivering parts, do not require human skill. In the bumper assembly process of automobile assembly, a worker must move {{to pick up the}} bumper twice in one procedure. This task may strain the worker and increase work time for each bumper. To address this situation, we developed a new co-worker robot, named B-PaDY, to work in cooperation with human workers on the automobile bumper assembly line. This co-worker robot is not directly involved in the assembly processes, but performs tasks to support human workers. The robot delivers the bumper to the worker on the production line at the right time. We propose hardware concepts and designs to ensure worker’s safety and allow for handling of all bumpers types. This robot uses a suspended rail system and handles the bumper, attaching to its reverse side. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the proper delivery timing based on a logistic regression model and confirm its effectiveness by performing experiments. We statistically model the worker’s state upon completion of the assembly task and stochastically determine the proper timing. By recognizing the worker’s behavior and supporting the worker with appropriate timing, our system effectively supplies the bumper to the worker and improves work efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{for generating}} energy and conducting research {{have been in}} operation for more than 50 years, and spent nuclear fuel and associated high-level waste have accumulated in temporary storage. Preparing this spent fuel and nuclear waste for safe and permanent storage in a geological repository involves developing a robotic packaging system—a system that can accommodate waste packages of various sizes {{and high levels of}} nuclear radiation. During repository operation, commercial and government-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste will be loaded into casks and shipped to the repository, where these materials will be transferred from the casks into a waste package, sealed, and placed into an underground facility. The waste packages range from 12 to 20 feet in height and four and a half to seven feet in diameter. Closure operations include sealing the waste package and all its associated functions, such as welding lids onto the container, filling the inner container with an inert gas, performing nondestructive examinations on welds, and conducting stress mitigation. The Idaho National Laboratory is designing and constructing a prototype Waste Package Closure System (WPCS). Control of the automated material handling {{is an important part of}} the overall design. Waste package lids, welding equipment, and other tools must be moved in and around the closure cell during the closure process. These objects are typically moved from tool racks to a specific position on the waste package to perform a specific function. Periodically, these objects are moved from a <b>tool</b> <b>rack</b> or the waste package to the adjacent glovebox for repair or maintenance. Locating and attaching to these objects with the remote handling system, a gantry robot, in a loosely fixtured environment is necessary for the operation of the closure cell. Reliably directing the remote handling system to pick and place the closure cell equipment within the cell is the major challenge...|$|E
40|$|Selecting {{the best}} {{set of tools}} to produce certain {{geometrical}} shapes/features in sheet metal punching {{is one of the}} problems that has a great effect on product development time, cost and achieved quality. The trend nowadays is, where at all possible, to limit design to the use of standard tools. Such an option makes the problem of selecting the appropriate set of tools even more complex, especially when considering that sheet metal features can have a wide range of complex shapes. Another dimension of complexity is limited <b>tool</b> <b>rack</b> capacity. Thus, an inappropriate tool selection strategy will lead to punching inefficiency and may require frequent stopping of the machine and replacing the required tools, which is a rather expensive and time consuming exercise. This work demonstrates that the problem of selecting the best set of tools is actually a process of searching an explosive decision tree. The difficulty in searching such types of decision trees is that intermediate decisions do not necessarily reflect the total cost implication of carrying out such a decision. A new approach to solve such a complex optimisation problem using the Monte Carlo Simulation Methods has been introduced in this thesis. The aim of the present work was to establish the use of Monte Carlo methods as an "assumptions or rule free" baseline or benchmark for the assessment of search strategies. A number of case studies are given, where the feasibility of Monte Carlo Simulation Methods as an efficient and viable method to optimise such a complex optimisation problem is demonstrated. The use of a Monte Carlo approach for selecting the best set of punching tools, showed an interesting point, that is, the effect of dominant "one-to-one" feature/tool matches on the efficiency of the search. This naturally led on to the need of a search methodology that will be more efficient than the application of the Monte Carlo method alone. This thesis presents some interesting speculations for a hybrid approach to tool selection to achieve a better solution than the use of the Monte Carlo method alone to achieve the optimum solution in a shorter time...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} teleoperator {{system which}} is based on task-referenced sensor-aided control has been developed to study supervisory manipulation. This system, called SUPERMAN, is capable of performing complicated tasks in real-time by utilizing the operator for high-level functions related to the unpredictable portions of a task, while the subordinate machine performs the more well-defined subtasks under human supervison. To determine whether supervisory control schemes such as these offer any advantage over manual control under real-time conditions, a number of experiments involving both simple and complicated tasks were performed. Six representative tasks were chosen for the study: (1) obtaining a <b>tool</b> from a <b>rack,</b> (2) returning the <b>tool</b> to the <b>rack,</b> (3) removing a nut, (4) placing samples in a storage bin, (5) opening and closing a valve, and (6) digging with a shovel. The experiments were performed under simulated conditions using four forms of manual control (i. e., switch rate, joystick rate, master-slave position control, and master-slave with force feedback), as well as supervisory control. Through these experiments the effectiveness and quality of control were evaluated {{on the basis of the}} time required to complete each portion of the task and the type and number of errors which occurred...|$|R

In this paper, the computer program has been designed to evaluate the manufacture abilities following design concept and analyze the technical parameters of helical cutting tool. The program can simulate the sections of helical cutting <b>tool</b> and the <b>rack</b> cutter, analyze the clearance angle, relief angle, and width top of the helical cutting tool, and modify the rack cutter profile to show the helical cutting tool profile suitably. This program can predict the differences during manufacture process and give the best solution for economical consideration...|$|R
30|$|The ISO {{standards}} {{specify a}} symmetric form and a pressure angle of 20 ° for a standard <b>rack</b> <b>tool.</b> However, as the pressure angle increases past 20 °, the bending strength {{can be expected}} to increase because of the increase in the tooth root thickness, and the contact pressure strength {{can be expected to}} increase because of the larger profile radius of curvature. Furthermore, although a pressure angle sufficiently greater than the limit of the tooth tip cannot be achieved, this can be solved by making the pressure angle {{on each side of the}} tooth asymmetric. Unidirectional torque transfer is the principal factor in general gearing, so there may be some issues with the strength on the low-pressure side being weaker.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{generating}} the gear tooth with a <b>rack</b> <b>tool</b> is applied on MAAG machine tools. Their specific cutting scheme {{leads to an}} irregular energetic loading of the tool cutting edge, during the rolling process. In this paper, we present a new method for analyzing the energetic load along the cutting edges of the rack shaped cutter, based on graphical modelling of the cutting process performed in CATIA. The energetic load smoothing is proposed to be obtained by finding an appropriate variation law for the circular feed communicated to the workpiece by toothing machine kinematical chain, during the rolling motion that permanently respects the rolling condition established between the centrodes attached to both tool and workpiece. A numerical solution in a concrete case of analysis is also included...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the idea of}} spur gear teeth with {{circular}} instead of the standard trochoidal root fillet is introduced and investigated numerically using BEM. The strength of these new teeth is studied {{in comparison with the}} standard design by discretizing the tooth boundary using isoparametric Boundary Elements. In order to facilitate the analysis the teeth are treated as non-dimensional assuming unitary loading normal to the profile at their Highest Point of Single Tooth Contact (HPSTC), so that non-dimensional stress vs. Contact ratio diagrams are plotted. The analysis demonstrates that the novel teeth exhibit higher bending strength (up to 70 %) in certain cases without affecting the pitting resistance since the geometry of the load carrying involute is not changed. The circular fillet design is particularly suitable in gear with a small number of teeth (pinions) and these novels gears can replace their existing counterparts in any mechanism without any alterations. Finally the geometry of the generating <b>tool</b> (i. e. <b>rack)</b> is determined {{in order to be able}} to cut these teeth using a generating method (i. e. hobbing) ...|$|R
