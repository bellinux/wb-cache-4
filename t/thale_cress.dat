5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the <b>Thale</b> <b>cress,</b> Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

25|$|Several miRNA {{modifications}} affect miRNA stability. As {{indicated by}} {{work in the}} model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (<b>thale</b> <b>cress),</b> mature plant miRNAs appear to be stabilized {{by the addition of}} methyl moieties at the 3' end. The 2'-O-conjugated methyl groups block the addition of uracil (U) residues by uridyltransferase enzymes, a modification that may be associated with miRNA degradation. However, uridylation may also protect some miRNAs; the consequences of this modification are incompletely understood. Uridylation of some animal miRNAs has been reported. Both plant and animal miRNAs may be altered by addition of adenine (A) residues to the 3' end of the miRNA. An extra A added to the end of mammalian miR-122, a liver-enriched miRNA important in hepatitis C, stabilizes the molecule and plant miRNAs ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates.|$|E
2500|$|The first WRKY {{transcription}} factor, (SPF1), {{was identified}} in 1994 for its involvement in sucrose regulation of gene expression in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). [...] A year later, two WRKY transcription factors, ABF1 and ABF2, established {{the role of}} WRKY proteins as a novel family of transcriptional regulators.

CSK and its redox {{regulatory}} function are inherited from the prokaryotic, cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts. CSK is a prediction of the CoRR Hypothesis for genes in organelles. CSK is intrinsic to chloroplasts, targeted to chloroplast genes, and may be required for the retention, in evolution, of chloroplast DNA.|$|E

5000|$|GC {{content is}} found to be {{variable}} with different organisms, the process of which is envisaged to be contributed to by variation in selection, mutational bias, and biased recombination-associated DNA repair. The species problem in prokaryotic taxonomy has led to various suggestions in classifying bacteria, and the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics has recommended use of GC ratios in higher level hierarchical classification. For example, the Actinobacteria are characterised as [...] "high GC-content bacteria". In Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), GC content is 72%. The GC-content of Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is 38%, and that of another common model organism, <b>thale</b> <b>cress</b> (Arabidopsis thaliana), is 36%. Because {{of the nature of the}} genetic code, it is virtually impossible for an organism to have a genome with a GC-content approaching either 0% or 100%. A species with an extremely low GC-content is Plasmodium falciparum (GC% = ~20%), and it is usually common to refer to such examples as being AT-rich instead of GC-poor.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged that codon biases reflect {{a balance between}} mutational biases and natural selection for translational optimization. Optimal codons in fast-growing microorganisms, like Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), reflect the composition of their respective genomic tRNA pool. It is thought that optimal codons help to achieve faster translation rates and high accuracy. As {{a result of these}} factors, translational selection is expected to be stronger in highly expressed genes, as is indeed the case for the above-mentioned organisms. In other organisms that do not show high growing rates or that present small genomes, codon usage optimization is normally absent, and codon preferences are determined by the characteristic mutational biases seen in that particular genome. Examples of this are Homo sapiens (human) and Helicobacter pylori. Organisms that show an intermediate level of codon usage optimization include Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin) or Arabidopsis thaliana (<b>thale</b> <b>cress).</b> Several viral families (herpesvirus, lentivirus, papillomavirus, polyomavirus, adenovirus, and parvovirus) are known to encode structural proteins that display heavily skewed codon usage compared to the host cell. The suggestion has been made that these codon biases {{play a role in the}} temporal regulation of their late proteins.|$|E
50|$|Kirsten Bomblies et al. {{from the}} Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology {{discovered}} that two genes passed down by each parent of the <b>thale</b> <b>cress</b> plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. When the genes are passed down, it ignites a {{reaction in the}} hybrid plant that turns its own immune system against it. In the parents, the genes were not detrimental, but they evolved separately to react defectively when combined. To test this, Bomblies crossed 280 genetically different strains of Arabidopsis in 861 distinct ways and found that 2 percent of the resulting hybrids were necrotic. Along with allocating the same indicators, the 20 plants also shared a comparable collection of genetic activity {{in a group of}} 1,080 genes. In almost all of the cases, Bomblies discovered that only two genes were required to cause the autoimmune response. Bomblies looked at one hybrid in detail and found that one of the two genes belonged to the NB-LRR class, a common group of disease resistance genes involved in recognizing new infections. When Bomblies removed the problematic gene, the hybrids developed normally. Over successive generations, these incompatibilities could create divisions between different plant strains, reducing their chances of successful mating and turning distinct strains into separate species.|$|E
50|$|The Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is an {{open access}} {{database}} that houses genetic and protein interactions curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major model organism species and humans. , the BioGRID contains 749,912 interactions as drawn from 43,149 publications that represent 30 model organisms. BioGRID data are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases and are directly downloadable {{in a variety of}} formats. In addition to general curation of the published literature for the major model species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in areas of particular relevance for biomedical sciences, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and various human disease-associated interaction networks. BioGRID curation is coordinated through an Interaction Management System (IMS) that facilitates the compilation interaction records through structured evidence codes, phenotype ontologies, and gene annotation. The BioGRID architecture has been improved in order to support a broader range of interaction and post-translational modification types, to allow the representation of more complex multi-gene/protein interactions, to account for cellular phenotypes through structured ontologies, to expedite curation through semi-automated text-mining approaches, and to enhance curation quality control. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), <b>thale</b> <b>cress</b> (Arabidopsis thaliana), and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe).|$|E
