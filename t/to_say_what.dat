5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} earlier {{examples}} in the Republican period and early Imperial period, the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. Formwork was arranged either horizontally or radially, {{but there is not}} enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> was typical.|$|E
5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you have got <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, {{we have to say}} it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{are a few}} others: the dog and the wolf, and two snakes, {{the common}} grass snake and the Aesculapian snake. As snakes do {{not appear in the}} art, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> cultural impact they had, if any.|$|E
25|$|It is emphatically the {{province}} and {{duty of the}} Judicial Department <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each.|$|E
25|$|Harris hawks {{were known}} of but unusual. For example, the book lists a {{falconry}} meet on {{four days in}} August 1971 at White Hill and Leafield in Dumfriesshire in Scotland; the hawks flown were 11 goshawks and one Harris hawk, and the book felt it necessary <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> a Harris hawk is.|$|E

25|$|The {{underground}} {{scenes of}} various genres are very lively in Finland {{at the moment}} {{and a lot of}} bands and artists defy the genre-limits.

25|$|In 2013, Swoopes became {{head coach}} of the Loyola University Chicago women's {{basketball}} team. In April 2016, Loyola announced that it was investigating Swoopes of alleged mistreatment, after the school newspaper reported that 10 of the team's players have either transferred or want a release from their scholarships.

25|$|The Copenhagen {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying determinism and realism. According to the Copenhagen {{interpretation of}} quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E
25|$|During the Estado Novo authoritarian regime, {{music was}} widely {{used by the}} left-wing {{resistance}} as a way <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> could not be said, singing about freedom, equality and democracy, mainly through metaphors and symbols. Many composers and singers became famous and persecuted by the political police, some of them being arrested or exiled, such as Zeca Afonso, Paulo de Carvalho, José Mário Branco, Sérgio Godinho, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Manuel Freire, Fausto, Vitorino, Júlio Pereira and some others. Their music was (and remains) mostly based on Portuguese folk music and elements of European-style singer-songwriter genres.|$|E

25|$|Félix {{was married}} four times. Her first {{marriage}} (1931–1938) {{was with the}} cosmetics sales agent Enrique Álvarez Alatorre. Félix herself came <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> her first marriage meant to her freedom, leaving her house where she was prey. Soon, the jealousy of her husband began to make her ill, and she began divorce proceedings. He fathered her only son, the actor Enrique Álvarez Félix. While visiting his son in Mexico City, where {{he lived with his}} mother, Álvarez refused to return him to Félix, taking him to Guadalajara. She was later able to get her son back years later {{with the help of her}} second husband, Agustín Lara.|$|E
25|$|Six-day {{racing is}} now {{predominantly}} popular in Europe, particularly in Belgium and Germany. Spectators {{may also be}} entertained by live music, and have access to restaurants and bars. The Munich race featured a funfair around {{the outside of the}} track, and a night-club in the cellar that opened at 2am when the racing finished. The start money for 24 riders at the Ghent six in 2000 came to £333,000, although the organiser, Patrick Sercu, said he was contractually bound not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> individual riders earned. The magazine Vélo, however, said the specialists collected €5,000 in 2002 and star riders more. The German rider, Erik Zabel, asked €75,000, which Sercu said was beyond his budget. There are prizes as the race goes on - and sometimes more unusual ways to earn money.|$|E
