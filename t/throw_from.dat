5|$|Clemson fielded the {{following}} kickoff, and its offense continued {{with the success}} it found in its final drive of the first half. As in that drive, C. J. Spiller was a key performer. Clemson's drive began at its 40-yard line, and it took just five plays for the Tigers to score a touchdown. Four of those plays, including the culminating one, came from Spiller, who covered 40 yards during them. Spiller's touchdown cut Georgia Tech's lead to 23–20. But as quickly as Clemson scored, Georgia Tech moved even more quickly. From its 30-yard line, the Yellow Jackets needed only three plays, the keystone coming on a 70-yard <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> Nesbitt to Thomas for a touchdown. With 5:10 remaining in the quarter, the Yellow Jackets restored the 10-point margin, 30–20.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{was rewarded}} with {{international}} selection for the five-match One Day International ODI series against India {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 Australian season. Nerve damage in her toe ruled Ebsary out of contention for the first match at Hurstville Oval, which the hosts won by eight wickets with more than 12 overs to spare. The next day, she was given her debut in the second match of the series, at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Ebsary made five not out as the hosts made 6/215 batting first. Ebsary came in at 6/194 with 14 balls remaining in the Australia innings. She took a single off each of the five balls she faced, rotating the strike as her partner Lisa Sthalekar completed an unbeaten century. In the seventh over of India's reply, Ebsary's <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> the boundary ran out Jaya Sharma as the opener attempted to take a third run, leaving the tourists at 2/9.|$|E

5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
5|$|Two running plays gained 11 {{yards and}} a first down, then Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton began {{throwing}} the ball. His first pass the game fell incomplete, and his second was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Rashad Carmichael, who ran {{it back to the}} Tennessee 44-yard line. Tech's second drive of the game thus began in Tennessee's defensive half. The first play of the drive was a 20-yard <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin. That completed pass was the longest play of the drive, which continued through short rushes and passes. On the seventh play after the interception, Williams ran the ball forward one yard, crossing the goal line for the game's first touchdown. Tech placekicker Matt Waldron successfully converted the extra point, and with 6:56 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led 7-0.|$|E
5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 athletes on the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players on the DL up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers tried to hold on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed on the DL. Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E

5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E

These data refute the popular notion that "being thrown clear" has survival benefit. In addition, {{there was no evidence that}} wearing a safety belt increased fatality risk from vehicle fire or submersion...|$|R

The International Cricket Council, however, decided against Reiffel taking any further part in the match. He was replaced by Marais Erasmus who was originally the third umpire.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Vettori {{took control}} with {{competent}} batting {{and got to}} 27 runs {{at the beginning of}} the 42nd over, with Mills having taken a more passive role at 7 runs. This role was soon to be reversed. Mills hit four sixes in four consecutive balls, over the space of two overs, in a display considered to be worthy of any current top batsman. In the following over, now needing only a run per ball bowled, Vettori was run out by a direct <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> Ricky Ponting, to have New Zealand 9/236.|$|E

25|$|Cobb's {{competitive}} fires {{continued to}} burn after retirement. In 1941, he faced Babe Ruth {{in a series}} of charity golf matches at courses outside New York, Boston and Detroit and won two out of three. At the 1947 Old-Timers' Day game in Yankee Stadium, he warned catcher Benny Bengough to move back, claiming he was rusty and hadn't swung a bat in almost 20 years. Bengough accordingly stepped back to avoid being struck by Cobb's backswing. Having repositioned the catcher, Cobb cannily laid down a perfect bunt in front of the plate and easily beat the <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> a surprised Bengough.|$|E
25|$|Dreyer won no {{national}} titles in 1937 or 1938, finishing second to Folwartshny in the indoor weight throw in both years. He regained the indoor weight throw title in 1939; in 1940 he finished second to Niles Perkins, but won the outdoor 56-pound weight throw {{for the first}} time, throwing 35ft6in (10.82m). He won seven consecutive national titles in the indoor weight <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> 1941 to 1947, a streak that remained unparalleled until Lance Deal won eight {{times in a row}} starting in 1989. Dreyer also won the outdoor weight throw in 1945 and the hammer throw in 1943, 1944 and 1945.|$|E

Florida State scored on their first possession in the second as well courtesy of a Jameis Winston pass to Kelvin Benjamin.

Kapugedera played only one ODI against Pakistan in 2017-18 season in the UAE. In the match he scored only 18 runs from 30 balls. During the fielding, Kapugedra struck the ball under the right eye after a <b>throw</b> <b>from</b> the keeper Dickwella, caused heavy swelling. After the incidence, he {{was removed from the}} next match and then from the series as well.|$|E
