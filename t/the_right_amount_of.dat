The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level.

5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{organizational}} ambidexterity has been resonated and applied in diverse areas of management research. When establishing its strategic direction, research institutions {{are confronted with}} strategic tradesoffs, namely balancing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> exploration of new knowledge and exploitation of existing knowledge in their research orientation. We investigate this trade-off by building {{on the notion that}} research institution need to reconcile the paradoxical demands of exploitation and exploration in their orientation. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of social network, funding, and productive organizational energy on knowledge exploration, knowledge exploitation and the capability of organizational ambidexterity in the context of research institution. A sample of 130 research institutions such as laboratory, study center and training center was collected through questionnaire survey. We tested the hypotheses using Partial Least Square (PLS). Findings of the study indicate that social network and funding are positively related to knowledge exploration and exploitation. However, productive organizational energy has no positive effect on knowledge exploration and exploitation. It is also confirmed that knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation have a significant influence on the capability of organizational ambidexterity, but knowledge exploitation has a dominant role on that effect. </p...|$|R

25|$|A {{successful}} ramming {{was difficult}} to achieve; just <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> speed and precise maneuvering were required. Fleets {{that did not have}} well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water and applying heat, the system {{can be brought to}} any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.|$|E
25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant {{the difference between life}} and death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E

40|$|Owing to {{imbalances}} {{in international}} trade activities, shipping companies accumulate {{a large number of}} unnecessary empty containers in the import-dominant ports, whilst request a large number of empty containers in export-dominant ports. The logistics challenge to shipping companies is to better manage and control their containers, which consist of company-owned containers and leased containers. The multi-port empty container allocation problem is concerned with the allocation of empty containers from supply ports to demand ports. In this paper, optimal pairs of critical policies, (U, D) for one port, which are importing empty containers up to U when the number of empty containers in the port is less than U, or exporting empty containers down to D when the number of empty containers is larger than D, doing nothing otherwise, are adapted to multi-port case so that decision-makers can make decisions about allocating <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> empty containers to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> ports at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time. This allocation problem has been formulated and the heuristic methods are designed according to that the average cost using (u, d) policy at one port is convex in u and d. Furthermore, the examples show that, using the heuristic algorithm, the result in the inland line case is quite close to the lower bound, even the distance is not so close in the global line case...|$|R

30|$|The use of {{biomaterials}} {{to support}} the healing process is another important aspect in treating musculoskeletal disease. Biomaterials are used as a structural template for the regenerating tissues, including bone, {{and at the same}} time they can function as a source of biological factors. A biomaterial can be designed to optimize the regenerative mechanisms by delivering <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> factors at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time and to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> location within <b>the</b> bone healing area. The new generation of biomaterial scaffolds is being designed to recapitulate the local cytokine and/or growth factor milieu of development and remodeling, and to stimulate specific cell subsets to proliferate and differentiate in the desired and patient-specific way. One example discussed at the workshop was the incorporation of factors recruiting M 1 macrophages over an initial period of time (to initiate vascularization) along with the factors (immobilized for sustained action) to recruit M 2 macrophages (to mature and stabilize vasculature). So far, little is known about the specific role of the M 1 and M 2 types in the different musculoskeletal diseases and healing phases (e.g. revascularization of a fractured bone or a bone transplant) and further research is needed to evaluate their potential. This ORS workshop from 2014 with its topics of osteoimmunology in fracture healing, joint replacement loosening, and in vitro model systems demonstrates the wide spectrum of bone-immuno-interplay. Future research should pay attention to this relevant field.|$|R

2500|$|Dark {{pigmented}} {{people living}} in high sunlight environments are at an advantage due to the high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> melanin produced in their skin. The dark pigmentation protects from DNA damage and absorbs <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> UV radiation needed by the body, as well as protects against folate depletion. Folate is a water-soluble vitamin B complex which naturally occurs in green, leafy vegetables, whole grains, and citrus fruits. Women need folate to maintain healthy eggs, for proper implantation of eggs, and for the normal development of placenta after fertilization. Folate is needed for normal sperm production in men. Furthermore, folate is essential for fetal growth, organ development, and neural tube development. Folate breaks down in high intense UVR. Dark-skinned women suffer {{the lowest level of}} neural tube defects. Folate {{plays an important role in}} [...] DNA production and gene expression. It is essential for maintaining proper levels of amino acids which make up proteins. Folate is used in the formation of myelin, the sheath the covers nerve cells and makes it possible to send electrical signals quickly. Folate also plays an important role in the development of many neurotransmitters, e.g. serotonin which regulates appetite, sleep, and mood. Serum folate is broken down by UV radiation or alcohol consumption. Because the skin is protected by the melanin, dark pigmented people have a lower chance of developing skin cancer and conditions related to folate deficiency, such as neural tube defects.|$|R
