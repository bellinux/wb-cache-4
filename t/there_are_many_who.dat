25|$|Another {{important}} {{group is}} the “afromexicanos” or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated {{from the rest of}} Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being “negro” is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is “chilena ” which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, “Soy negro de la Costa…,” has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico’s cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.|$|E
500|$|Anzelewsky {{speculated that}} the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria. Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm {{description}} of Barbara's portrait—"the mother of Albrecht Dürer in oil colors on wood, [...] <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> {{do not believe it}} to be a work of Dürer"—led Brand Philip to conclude that Albrecht's panel was likely sold individually as the more accomplished and marketable of the two. The attribution is widely accepted today. In 2013 Stephan Kemperdick noted the sophistication of the Nuremberg portrait and that its three-dimensional modeling of the head displays a level of skill beyond Wolgemut and his circle.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{attitude}} of the king is really extraordinary. His attitude towards the Muslims is perfect: he gives them employment, he choses his officers among them, and all, or almost all, keep their faith secret and can remain faithful to the faith of Islam. The king has full confidence in the Muslims and relies on them to handle many of his affairs, including the most important ones, {{to the point that}} the Great Intendant for cooking is a Muslim (...) His viziers and chamberlains are eunuchs, of which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many,</b> <b>who</b> are the members of his government and on whom he relies for his private affairs."Ibn Jubair, Rihla.|$|E
2500|$|Recently in {{the great}} Sung dynasty of China <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> call {{themselves}} [...] "Zen masters". They {{do not know the}} length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, {{it would not have been}} transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.|$|E

2500|$|After {{publication}} in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. [...] Catch-22 seemed {{to embody the}} feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> feel that [...] "the comic fable that ends in horror has {{become more and more}} clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities {{of the world in which}} we live and hope to survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} method of bass drum playing is a [...] "heel-up" [...] technique: the pedals are struck {{with the ball}} of the feet using force {{primarily}} from the thigh {{as opposed to the}} ankles when using the [...] "heel-down" [...] technique. Most drummers play single strokes, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> are also capable of playing doubles or diddles. Drummers such as Thomas Lang, Virgil Donati, and Terry Bozzio are capable of performing complicated solos on top of an ostinato bass drum pattern. Thomas Lang, for example, has mastered the heel-up and heel-down (single- and double-stroke) {{to the extent that he}} is able to play dynamically with the bass drum and to perform various rudiments with his feet.|$|E
2500|$|... “In {{summarizing}} this discussion, I would restate that {{on three}} of the main theories in explanation of these phenomena, - a US development, a Russian development, and space ships - the evidence either of fact or of logic is so strongly against them that they warrant at present no more than speculative consideration. However, {{it is important that}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> believe in them {{and will continue to do}} so in spite of any official pronouncement which may be made. This whole affair has demonstrated that there is a fair proportion of our population which is mentally conditioned to acceptance of the incredible. Thus we arrive at two danger points which, in a situation of international tension, seem to have National Security implications.” ...|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the 1960s and 1970s were {{challenging}} {{times for}} those working in birth control. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> initially {{hostile to the}} new developments in service provision, {{and in particular the}} provision of contraception for unmarried women became a battleground.|$|R

60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> no poor {{inhabitants}} in {{that great}} area of twenty-five hundred miles; and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> rich.

2500|$|Restricting {{population}} size is a proposed solution. Thomas Malthus argued that population growth {{could be controlled}} by natural disasters and voluntary limits through [...] "moral restraint." [...] Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> believe {{that the world has}} more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems. For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, [...] "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the public distribution system. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet it {{has been}} argued whether or not {{identification}} with the external object should still be the core of a correct approach to sensation, for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> state the definition thus because they regard the link with external reality as crucial. If sensations are defined as [...] "raw feels", there arises a palpable threat to the reliability of knowledge. The reason has been given that, if one sees them as neurophysiological happenings in the brain, it is difficult to understand how they could have any connection to entities, whether in the body or the external world. It has been declared, by John McDowell for example, that to countenance qualia as a [...] "bare presence" [...] prevents us ever gaining a certain ground for our knowledge. The issue is thus fundamentally an epistemological one: it would appear that access to knowledge is blocked if one allows the existence of qualia as fields in which only virtual constructs are before the mind.|$|E

50|$|During the Middle Ages {{magic in}} Europe took on many forms.

50|$|While most Haredim {{were opposed}} to the {{establishment}} of the State of Israel, and Haredim mostly still do not celebrate its national Independence Day or other state-instituted holidays, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> threw their considerable weight in support of the nascent state.|$|R
2500|$|Wisden {{described}} Fred Trueman as [...] "probably {{the greatest}} fast bowler England has produced".

50|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> {{came to a}} {{view that}} the process which had been {{followed}} was flawed: {{the absence of a}} process defined in legislation to review the conduct of a judge left too much room for review by the law societies, government or Parliament, of even other bodies without necessarily involving the judiciary.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{continued}} the Baital, many people believed Manaswi's story, {{as it was}} marvellous and incredible. Even to the present day, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>who</b> decidedly think him legally married to the daughter of Raja Subichar.|$|E
