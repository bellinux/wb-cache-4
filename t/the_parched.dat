Daily temperatures in the wet season typically range from 30°C to 37°C, reaching over 40°C from late September to late November. Very high humidity accompanies high temperatures during the build-up period to the wet season, when the region receives spectacular electrical storms. The wet season monsoon period is a dramatic time of year, from large thunderstorms and heavy downpours to the transitions of lush greenery appearing from <b>the</b> <b>parched</b> deciduous landscapes of the dry season. Katherine {{experiences a}}round 50 thunderstorm days per year, most of which occur from November to April.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan was {{assigned}} to command the 11th Division, III Corps, in Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio. On October 8, 1862, Sheridan led his division in the Battle of Perryville. Under orders from Buell and his corps commander, Maj. Gen. Charles Gilbert, Sheridan sent Col. Daniel McCook's brigade to secure a water supply for the army. McCook drove off the Confederates and secured water for <b>the</b> <b>parched</b> Union troops at Doctor's Creek. Gilbert ordered McCook not to advance any further and then rode to consult with Buell. Along the way, Gilbert ordered his cavalry to attack the Confederates in Dan McCook's front. Sheridan heard the gunfire {{and came to the}} front with another brigade. Although the cavalry failed to secure the heights in front of McCook, Sheridan's reinforcements drove off the Southerners. Gilbert returned and ordered Sheridan to return to McCook's original position. Sheridan's aggressiveness convinced the opposing Confederates under Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, that they should remain on the defensive. His troops repulsed Confederate attacks later that day, but did not participate in the heaviest fighting of the day, which occurred on the Union left.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with Chopra receiving critical acclaim for her performance. Subhash K.

Debutant director Omang Kumar weaves seamlessly {{in and out of}} Ms Kom's remarkable life creating a work that is as dramatic as Mehboob's Mother India and as inspiring as Attenborough's Gandhi." [...] Rediff.com rated the film 4.5 out of 5, noting it as a victory for its protagonist Chopra, scriptwriter Saiwyn Quadras, and director Omung Kumar and writing, [...] "Mary's story is delivered with a sincerity that makes it irresistible." [...] Sonia Chopra from Sify described the film as a [...] "thrilling ringside view", saying that [...] "Mary Kom is an important film that's hugely inspiring. But more importantly, it's also great fun to watch." [...] The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4 stars out of 5 calling it as Bollywood's answer to Academy Award-winning film Million Dollar Baby (2004). Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 stars, stating [...] "Omung Kumar certainly deserves an ovation for having shown the guts to make a biopic on Mary Kom, something which will surely go down in the history of exemplary biopics on Indian celluloid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unbeknownst {{to anyone}} in the Confederate army, McPherson's men of the XVII Corps were lurking near Utica, Mississippi, {{maintaining}} strict drum and bugle silence and a strong cavalry screen. The two divisions had been inching along <b>the</b> <b>parched</b> ridge road between Utica and Raymond for two days, struggling to maintain proximity to a water source, while the remainder of Grant's army probed north towards the railroad.

Rising before daylight, Federal cavalry screening General John Logan's Third Division triggered the alarm from the state cavalry posted on the Utica road almost immediately.|$|E
2500|$|The hymns of Rigveda declare {{him to be}} the [...] "king {{that moves}} and moves not", the friend of mankind who holds the {{different}} tribes on earth together. In one interpretation by Oldenberg, the hymns are referring to the snaking thunderstorm clouds that gather with bellowing winds (Vritra), Indra is then seen as the storm god who intervenes in these clouds with his thunderbolts, which then release the rains nourishing <b>the</b> <b>parched</b> land, crops and thus humanity. In another interpretation by Hillebrandt, Indra is a symbolic sun god (Surya) and Vritra is a symbolic winter-giant (historic mini cycles of ice age, cold) in the earliest, not the later, hymns of Rigveda. The Vritra is an ice-demon of colder central Asia and northern latitudes, who holds back the water. Indra is the one who releases the water from the winter demon, an idea that later metamorphosed into his role as storm god. According to Griswold, this is not a completely convincing interpretation, because Indra is simultaneously a lightning god, a rain god and a river-helping god in the Vedas. Further, the Vritra demon that Indra slew is best understood as any obstruction, whether it be clouds that refuse to release rain or mountains or snow that hold back the water.|$|E

40|$|While much {{research}} related to forecasting return volatility does so in a univariate setting, this paper includes proxies for information flows to forecast intra-day volatility for the IBEX 35 futures market. The belief is that volume {{or the number of}} transactions conveys important information about the market that may be useful in forecasting. Our results suggest that augmenting a variety of GARCH-type models with these proxies lead to improved forecasts across a range of intra-day frequencies. Furthermore, our results present an interesting picture whereby <b>the</b> <b>PARCH</b> model generally performs well at the highest frequencies and shorter forecasting horizons, whereas the component model performs well at lower frequencies and longer forecast horizons. Both models attempt to capture long memory; <b>the</b> <b>PARCH</b> model allows for exponential decay in the autocorrelation function, while the component model captures trend volatility, which dominates over a longer horizon. These characteristics are likely to explain the success of each model...|$|R
