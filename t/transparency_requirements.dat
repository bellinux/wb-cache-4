25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007, which resulted from insufficient consumer financial {{protection in the}} US, conflicts {{of interest in the}} credit rating agency industry, and defective <b>transparency</b> <b>requirements</b> in derivatives markets, triggered a massive rise in corporate insolvencies. Contemporary debate, particularly in the banking sector, has shifted to prevention of insolvencies, by scrutinising excessive pay, conflicts of interest among financial services institutions, capital adequacy, and the causes of excessive risk taking. The Banking Act 2009 created a special insolvency regime for banks, called the special resolution regime, envisaging that banks will be taken over by the government in extreme circumstances.|$|E

This legislation was rejected by a 6–1–1 vote. Fulop then proposed that Jersey City voters {{have the opportunity to}} institute new ethics reform measures by voting on two referendums. The first referendum would prevent elected officials or government employees from collecting more than one taxpayer-financed salary, a practice known as double dipping. By state law, one cannot stop an individual from serving multiple government positions by popular vote, but since state law allows a municipality to hold back a paycheck and benefits if voted on by referendum, it is possible to change the pay structures at the local level to ensure that there is less incentive to collect multiple paychecks and pensions. The second referendum would make it illegal for any entity that does business with the city, such as a developer or contractor, to make a political contribution to a local candidate for a one-year period. This would prohibit those with a specific interest in controlling a singular aspect of local government from bankrolling a local elected official who may have the power to influence that specific interest.|$|E

Different from the first sub-category, content-based watermarking schemes have utilized the concept of Human Visual System (HVS) to adapt more efficiently to the local characteristics of the host signal. These schemes exploit more properties of the image so that they can maximize the watermark robustness while satisfying the <b>transparency</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic <b>transparency</b> <b>requirements</b> on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a novel JND model based on discrete wavelet transform. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed JND model is comparable to that of the full-band JND model.

5000|$|In 2009 {{the society}} became the secretariat of two all-party {{parliamentary}} groups (APPGs), for Transatlantic and International Security, chaired by Gisela Stuart, and for Homeland Security, chaired by Bernard Jenkin.

In 2014, following a query, the society refused to disclose this information and resigned its position as secretariat of the APPGs concerned in order to comply with the Rules. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Hudson, upheld a complaint against these APPGs on the grounds data had not been provided, but noted the society had already resigned its position and that the consequence of this non-provision therefore [...] "appears to have taken effect" [...] as the Rules intended. The case was therefore closed with no further action taken and the APPGs themselves dissolved with the dissolution of Parliament in March 2015. The APPG Rules were subsequently changed in March 2015 so that only those non-profit organisations providing services to APPGs of more than £12,500 in value needed to declare their corporate donors.|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} {{bilateral}} haptic telemanipulation {{systems in the}} presence of multiple uncertain sources including uncertain communication time-delay is indeed a non-trivial problem. Such control is typically evaluated by three criteria: stability, performance and transparency. This thesis discusses these criteria in the context of how linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique and o-theory can be applied into the design of robust bilateral haptic telemanipulation systems. As a result, a framework of controller design for such a system based on PHANToM haptic devices is presented under the assumptions that all of the components in the system, including the communication channel with time-delay, possess uncertainty. The proposed design framework possesses following new characteristics compared to the previous work in the literature: (1) all components in the system are potentially uncertain and the environment possesses parametric uncertainty; (2) the master controller is structured as of two-degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) to avoid poor transient performance; (3) force reflection from slave to master is realized as a function of environment reaction forces and differences between master and slave displacements to meet the system <b>transparency</b> <b>requirement,</b> and (4) the communication channel is treated as a second-order system with parametric and multiplicative uncertainties, which represents a more accurate and less conservative realization. The analysis of the resulting controllers made in both frequency and time domain shows that the resulting system realizes well the robust stability and performance requirements that are envisaged in this proble...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{application}} of a computerized financial control system on a target cost contract {{for the development of a}} cable car construction project in Hong Kong. The author is one of the key system designers supplied by the consultancy services of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The system emphasizes the enhancement of the integrity and effectiveness of decision-support and the information flow among the various construction parties for construction target cost contracts aided by a computerized construction integrated management system, equipped with intelligent database and data mining technology. Complex and capital-intensive construction projects usually involve higher risks. A partnering approach can be applied to such projects as a basis to bring about better project results. Partly as a result of rational risk sharing, target cost contracting can also be effective, where a fixed target cost is set based on given parameters at the outset. If this fixed target is exceeded or undercut, the outcome is split between the contracting parties in a pain/gain sharing fashion. An advantage of this approach lies in the incentive to the contractor to be efficient and to achieve savings. Target cost contracting has been globally recommended as an appropriate means of realizing high-risk construction projects. So as to satisfy the high <b>transparency</b> <b>requirement</b> in financial controls and the information demand for forward financial planning, a computerized integrated management system, with data mining and neural capability, is recommended to support decision making in target cost contracting...|$|R
