When it comes my turn <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> land, I do not think I shall give it up as they did." [...] Regarding {{possible}} future land cessions, he said: [...] "Father I speak for my people, not for myself. I am an old man. My fire is almost outthere is but little smoke. When I sit in my wigwam & smoke my pipe, I think of what has past and what is to come, and it makes my heart shake. When business comes before us, we will try and act like Chiefs. If any thing is to be done, it had better be done straight." ...|$|E

"I find it most {{strange that}} the Stephenville Town Council {{is seeking to}} acquire control of my {{property}} along Long Gull Pond, off Hansen Memorial Highway, in order to operate a public park several miles from its legal boundaries. In recent months the Council and the Department of Mines and Resources, has requested me <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> property to establish a so called 'provincial town park'. In {{each of the three}} letters offering to buy the property a ridiculously low price is used. The only organizations which have publicly declared themselves are the Town Council and the Stephenville Lions Club.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{said that}} his father was able to vote his {{conscience}} until he {{became a member of the}} House Democratic leadership, at which time he had to vote with the party line. [...] For instance, his father voted for the 1975 federal bailout of a bankrupt New York City even though he personally opposed it. [...] Jones said of that vote, [...] "He had to vote it that way. I would rather do what I think is right than <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> political soul." [...] Jones drifted towards the libertarian spectrum when he changed his positions on foreign policy including the Iraq War.|$|E

6000|$|Ethel hesitated, {{and looked}} at him in astonishment. [...] "That's very queer," [...] she said, [...] "for Mr. Cartwright wants me <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> out <b>my</b> little bit of Midland and put it all into the same New Zealands. He says they're so safe and pay so well." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Three {{organizations}} {{are involved in}} trying to force me off land I legally own — Stephenville Town Council: Stephenville Chamber of Commerce: and Stephenville Lions Club. It was the Chamber of Commerce in 1957 that called for the setting up of a civic park at Long Gull Pond. It is a whisper campaign, to make people believe I am {{standing in the way of}} progress, that I am stubbornly refusing <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> land thus robbing the people of the west coast their own born-right to boil the kettle on their chosen spot of summer scenery. This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I have offered to make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority. This fact, plus the fact that land is still available elsewhere on the pond, shows that more than just a park is involved.|$|E

If it be lawful for me <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> commodity, as afore, as dear as I can, {{then there}} can be no sin in my trading, how {{unreasonably}} soever I manage my calling, whether by lying, swearing, cursing, cheating, for all this is but <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> commodity as dear as I can (Eph 4:25).

5000|$|While Vecoven still sells EPROMs {{with the}} {{upgraded}} firmware (V3.09), Fraser no longer supports his own project as he feels {{there is no}} longer a market for it: [...] "I have decided therefore <b>to</b> stop <b>selling</b> <b>my</b> JX ROM.

60|$|First, If it be lawful for me alway <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> {{commodity}} as dear, or {{for as much}} as I can, then 'tis lawful for me to lay {{aside in}} my dealing with others, good conscience, to them, and to God: but it is not lawful for me, in my dealing with others, to lay aside good conscience, &c.

6000|$|... "There ain't no proper {{prices for}} pownies,--as {{there is for}} jew'ls and sich like." [...] If this was {{intended}} for sarcasm upon Lady Eustace in regard to her diamonds, Mr. Gowran {{ought to have been}} dismissed on the spot.

6000|$|... "Granted. Why didn't you foresee it? You had {{the right}} of {{access to all the}} {{information}} in my hands; you could inspect accounts in the London office; I suppose you read the financial papers.

Then I found it would be well for me, if I {{did not wish to}} be arrested as a thief who had robbed a museum, to {{endeavor}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>my</b> collection as a whole in some other country. As a professional dealer in gems from a foreign land I would be less liable to suspicion than if I endeavored to peddle my jewels one at a time.

5000|$|Tsuge {{drew from}} his own life {{experiences}} {{for many of the}} stories in the manga. Tsuge had a dysfunctional family—with his mother, father, and stepfather always fighting—so he would stay out of his house until his two brothers came home from work. After graduating from middle school, he got a job assembling and cleaning equipment at a blood bank where [...] "the physically handicapped, hoodlums, and thugs" [...] waited in the waiting room and in the yard. One time as he was cleaning the bathroom, he read graffiti in pencil saying: [...] "Even I, a former lieutenant in the navy, have been reduced <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> <b>my</b> blood", which weighed on his heart. Another seller that had an impression on him was one who was six feet tall and had the build of a wrestler, but a disfigured face, which resulted in the man wailing after nurses gossiped about him.|$|R
