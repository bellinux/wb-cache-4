50|$|<b>Talose</b> is an {{aldohexose}} sugar. It is {{an unnatural}} monosaccharide that is {{soluble in water}} and slightly soluble in methanol. Some etymologists suggest that talose's name derives from the automaton of Greek mythology named Talos, but the relevance is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, <b>talose</b> and gulose {{were also}} {{synthesized}} {{from a different}} dihydropyran.

5000|$|The {{positions}} of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of L-glucose. [...] D- and L-glucose {{are two of}} the 16 possible aldohexoses; the other 14 are allose, altrose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and <b>talose,</b> each with two enantiomers, [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-".|$|E
50|$|As an example, four of {{the carbon}} atoms of the {{aldohexose}} class of molecules are asymmetric, therefore the Le Bel-van't Hoff rule gives a calculation of 24=16 stereoisomers. This is indeed the case: these chemicals are two enantiomers each of eight different diastereomers: allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and <b>talose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Examples of aldose include glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, erythrose, threose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, <b>talose,</b> and galactose.

All of these complex sugars serve {{an important role in}} biochemistry.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mnemonic}} for the aldohexoses is [...] "All Altruists Gladly Make Gum in Gallon Tanks": allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, <b>talose.</b> When {{drawn in}} this order, the Fischer {{projections of the}} D-aldohexoses follow a pattern: beginning with allose having all four hydroxyl groups on the right, going through the mnemonic at carbon 2 the hydroxyl groups alternate right-left with each different sugar (allose left, altrose right, glucose left, etc.). At carbon 3, the first two {{are on the right}}, the next two are on the left, and so on. At carbon 4, the first four are on the right and the rest are on the left. At carbon 5, all eight D-aldohexoses have the hydroxyl group on the right (because if the hydroxyl group were on the left instead, due to the [...] system naming convention, they would be L-sugars rather than D-sugars [...] ).|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of analogues of α-galactosyl ceramide (KRN 7000) {{with an additional}} hydroxy group in the phytosphingosine chains and with varying stereochemistry is described.

Galectin- 4 C and 8 N {{were found to}} prefer the d-talopyranose configuration to the natural ligand d-galactopyranose configuration.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the separations of all aldopentoses (ribose, arabinose, xylose and lyxose) and aldohexoses (glucose, galactose, allose, altrose, mannose, gulose, idose and <b>talose)</b> on the D 6 stationary phase {{prepared by the}} reaction of chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyl- 1, 6 -diaminohexane, we examined the effect of varying the concentration of the NaOH eluent on the elution orders. Separations of these aldoses were achieved using a 20 mM NaOH eluent. The elution behaviors of the aldoses were probably due to not only the individual pKa values, but also the chemical structures of the cyclic aldoses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the synthesis, purification, and liquid-crystalline behaviour {{of a series}} of alkyl 1 -thioglycopyranosides. The synthesis of these derivatives was carried out via a Lewis acid mediated coupling of the fully acetylated monosaccharide with an alkanethiol. The choice of the Lewis acid depends of the configuration of AcO- 2. The carbohydrate-derived surfactants exhibit thermotropic liquid-crystalline behaviour. The alkyl 1 -thioglycopyranosides form the expected smectic A phases upon heating. The clearing temperatures vary with alkyl chain length which is in accordance with the accepted model for the SA phase of amphiphilic carbohydrate mesogens. For the alkyl 1 -thiotalopyranosides, the clearing points are much lower than expected, presumably due to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the <b>talose</b> moiety. ...|$|E

Those possessing an amphiphilc molecular structure are also termed biosurfactant and are of great interest due to their often unique properties. Rouxiella sp. DSM  100043 is a gram negative enterobacter isolated from peat-bog soil and described as a new biosurfactant producing species in this study. Rouxiella sp. produces glycolipids, biosurfactants with a carbohydrate moiety in its structure. This study characterizes the composition of glycolipids with different hydrophobicities that have been produced during cultivation in a bioreactor and been extracted and purified from separated foam. Using two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the hydrophilic moieties are elucidated as glucose with various acylation sites and as <b>talose</b> within the most polar glycolipids. The presence of 3 ′ hydroxy lauroleic acid as well as myristic and myristoleic acid has been detected.|$|E
40|$|The uncharacterized gene {{previously}} {{proposed as}} a mannose- 6 -phosphate isomerase from Bacillus subtilis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The maximal {{activity of the}} recombinant enzyme was observed at pH 7. 5 and 40 °C {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 mM Co 2 +. The isomerization activity was specific for aldose substrates possessing hydroxyl groups oriented in the same direction at the C- 2 and C- 3 positions, such as the d and l forms of ribose, lyxose, <b>talose,</b> mannose, and allose. The enzyme exhibited the highest activity for l-ribulose among all pentoses and hexoses. Thus, l-ribose, as a potential starting material for many l-nucleoside-based pharmaceutical compounds, was produced at 213 g/liter from 300 -g/liter l-ribulose by mannose- 6 -phosphate isomerase at 40 °C for 3 h, with a conversion yield of 71 % and a volumetric productivity of 71 g liter− 1 h− 1...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{biopolymer}} {{was described}} {{in the form of}} an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) by Pedobacter sp. strain MCC-Z, a member of a bacterial genus not previously described as an emulsifier producer. Thenew biomolecule was extracted, purified and characterized, and its surface and emulsifying propertieswere evaluated. The purified bioemulsifier, named Pdb-Z, showed high emulsifying activity (E 24 % = 64 %) and reduced the surface tension of water up to 41 mN/m with a critical micelle concentration value of 2. 6 mg/mL. The chemical characterization of Pdb-Z was performed using 1 H NMR, FT-IR, HPLC/MS/MS andGC/MS. Pdb-Z was found to contain 67 % of carbohydrates, consisting mainly of galactose and minor quan-tities of <b>talose,</b> 30 % of lipids, being pentadecanoic acid the major lipidic constituent, and 3 % of proteins. Thebioemulsifier was a glycolipids-protein complex with an estimated molecular mass of 106 Da.

40|$|In this work, {{the polar}} {{metabolite}} pool of commercial caprine milk was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis. Experimental data {{were compared with}} those of cow milk and the discriminant analysis correctly classified milk. By the same means, differences due to heat treatments (UHT or pasteurization) on milk samples were also investigated. Results of the 2 discriminant analyses were combined, with the aim of finding the discriminant metabolites unique for each class and shared by 2 classes. Valine and glycine were specific to goat milk, <b>talose</b> and malic acid to cow milk, and hydroxyglutaric acid to pasteurized samples. Glucose and fructose were shared by cow milk and UHT-treated samples, whereas ribose was shared by pasteurized and goat milk. Other discriminant variables were not attributed to specific metabolites. Furthermore, with the aim to reduce food fraud, the issue of adulteration of caprine milk by addition of cheaper bovine milk has been also addressed. To this goal, mixtures of goat and cow milk were prepared by adding the latter in a range from 0 to 100...|$|E
40|$|Acetophenones are a {{class of}} {{aromatic}} compounds frequently produced by plants {{as a response to}} a stress or as a protection reaction against parasites or herbivors. In the present research, we investigated the role of the carbonyl moiety in a series of commercially available aromatic ketones tested for their nematicidal activity against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid et White) Chitwood. Interestingly, we found that the presence of electron withdrawing groups onto the aromatic ring were highly efficient in inducing nematode paralysis and death (EC 50 / 24 h between 2. 5 and 54. 8 mg/L and EC 50 / 72 h between 2. 3 and 65. 6 mg/L, respectively). Moreover, a chlorine atom in Î±-position to the carbonyl functionality emerged as a key residue in improving acetophenones activity. In this paper, the nematicidal ability of a series of differently substituted acetophenones is reported and the preliminary structure-activity relationship studies are also discussed. We also performed an in vitro GC-MS metabolomics analysis on the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida, after treatment with 2, 4 '-dichloroacetophenone (6) at 100 mg/L for 24 h. The 1 -dodecanol and <b>talose</b> were evidenced as the main upregulated metabolites, suggesting a possible V-ATPase dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Galectin- 3 is {{extensively}} {{involved in}} metabolic and disease processes, {{such as cancer}} metastasis, thus giving impetus {{for the design of}} specific inhibitors targeting this b-galactose-binding protein. Thiodigalactoside (TDG) presents a scaffold for construction of galectin inhibitors, and its inhibition of galectin- 1 has already demonstrated beneficial effects as an adjuvant with vaccine immunotherapy, thereby improving the survival outcome of tumour-challenged mice. A novel approach-replacing galactose with its C 2 epimer, talose-offers an alternative framework, as extensions at C 2 permit exploitation of a galectin- 3 -specific binding groove, thereby facilitating the design of selective inhibitors. We report the synthesis of thioditaloside (TDT) and crystal structures of the galectin- 3 carbohydrate recognition domain in complexes with TDT and TDG. The different abilities of galactose and <b>talose</b> to anchor to the protein correlate with molecular dynamics studies, likely explaining the relative disaccharide binding affinities. The feasibility of a TDT scaffold to enable access to a particular galectin- 3 binding groove and the need for modifications to optimise such a scaffold for use in the design of potent and selective inhibitors are assessed.

40|$|Two {{galactose}} uptake {{systems were}} found in the mycelia of Neurospora crassa. In glucose-grown mycelia, galactose was transported by a low-affinity (Km = 400 mM) constitutive system which was distinct from the previously described glucose transport system I (R. P. Schneider and W. R. Wiley, J. Bacteriol. 106 : 479 [...] 486, 1971). In carbon-starved mycelia or mycelia incubated with galactose, a second galactose transport activity appeared which required energy, had a high affinity for galactose (Km = 0. 7 mM), and was shown to be the same as glucose transport system II. System II also transported mannose, 2 -deoxyglucose, xylose, and <b>talose</b> and is therefore a general monosaccharide transport system. System II was derepressed by carbon starvation, completely repressed by glucose, mannose, and 2 -deoxyglucose, and partially repressed by fructose and xylose. Incubation with galactose yielded twice as much activity as starvation. This extra induction by galactose required protein synthesis, and represented an increase in activity of system II rather than the induction of another transport system. Glucose, mannose, and 2 -deoxyglucose caused rapid degradation of preexisting system II; fructose and xylose caused a slower degradation of activity...|$|E
40|$|Galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 have {{roles in}} cancer and inflammation. Galectin- 1 has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} significant protein produced by tumour cells to promote tumour development, angiogenesis and metastasis and consequently represents an impor- tant target to inhibit. The design of inhibitors tar- geting the carbohydrate recognition domain that is known to recognize galactose is an important approach {{in the fight against}} cancer. Based on the analysis of crystal structures, we pursued the concept that if the galactose was replaced with <b>talose</b> (the C 2 epimer of galactose) as a scaffold, then O 2 substituents would be directed closer to the protein surface and provide opportunity to design inhibitors that are more specific towards particular galectins. Our elucidation of X-ray crys- tal structures of two of our synthesized talosides in complex with galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 pro- vides the first atomic information on the interac- tions of galectins, and indeed any protein, with talosides. These results have enabled a structure- based rationale for the specificity differences shown by galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 towards these talosides and demonstrate new opportunities for further exploitation as specific inhibitors of galectins.

40|$|When {{plants are}} pre-exposed to stress, they can produce some stable signals and {{physiological}} reactions {{that may be}} carried forward as ‘stress memory’. However, there is insufficient information about is known about plants’ stress memory responses mechanisms. Here, two tall fescue genotypes, heat-tolerant PI 574522 and heat-sensitive PI 512315, were subjected to recurring high-temperature pre-acclimation treatment. Two heat shock protein (HSP) genes, LMW-HSP and HMW-HSP, exhibited transcriptional memory for their higher transcript abundance during one or more subsequent stresses (S 2, S 3, S 4) relative to the first stress (S 1), and basal transcript levels during the recovery states (R 1, R 2 and R 3). Activated transcriptional memory from two trainable genes could persist up to 4 days, and induce higher thermotolerance in tall fescue. This was confirmed by greater turf quality and lower electrolyte leakage. Pre-acclimation treatment inhibited the decline at steps of O-J-I-P and energy transport fluxes in active Photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) for both tall fescue genotypes. The heat stress memory was associated with major shifts in leaf metabolite profiles. Furthermore, there was an exclusive increase in leaf organic acids (citric acid, malic acid, tris phosphoric acid, threonic acid), sugars (sucrose, glucose, idose, allose, <b>talose,</b> glucoheptose, tagatose, psicose), amino acids (serine, proline, pyroglutamic acid, glycine, alanine) and one fatty acid (butanoic acid) in pre-acclimated plants. These discoveries involved in transcriptional memory, PSII RC energy transport and metabolite profiles could provide {{new insights into the}} plant high–temperature response process...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{responses}} to cadmium (Cd) {{may be associated}} with variations in Cd tolerance in plants. The objectives of this study were to examine changes in metabolic profiles in bermudagrass in response to Cd stress and to identify predominant metabolites associated with differential Cd tolerance using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two genotypes of bermudagrass with contrasting Cd tolerance were exposed to 0 and 1. 5 mM CdSO 4 for 14 days in hydroponics. Physiological {{responses to}} Cd were evaluated by determining turf quality, growth rate, chlorophyll content and normalized relative transpiration. All these parameters exhibited higher tolerance in WB 242 than in WB 144. Cd treated WB 144 transported more Cd to the shoot than in WB 242. The metabolite analysis of leaf polar extracts revealed 39 Cd responsive metabolites in both genotypes, mainly consisting of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, fatty acids and others. A difference in the metabolic profiles was observed between the two bermudagrass genotypes exposed to Cd stress. Seven amino acids (norvaline, glycine, proline, serine, threonine, glutamic acid and gulonic acid), four organic acids (glyceric acid, oxoglutaric acid, citric acid and malic acid,) and three sugars (xylulose, galactose and <b>talose)</b> accumulated more in WB 242 than WB 144. However, compared to the control, WB 144 accumulated higher quantities of sugars than WB 242 in the Cd regime. The differential accumulation of these metabolites could be associated with the differential Cd tolerance in bermudagrass...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii {{produces}} {{a variety of}} capsular polysaccharides (CPS) via genes located at the chromosomal K locus and some KL gene clusters include genes for the synthesis of specific sugars. The structures of K 11 and K 83 CPS produced by isolates LUH 5545 and LUH 5538, which carry related KL 11 a and KL 83 gene clusters, respectively, were established by sugar analysis and one- and two-dimensional 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Both CPS contain L-rhamnose (L-Rha) and 6 -deoxy-L-talose (L- 6 dTal), and both KL gene clusters include genes for dTDP-L-Rhap synthesis and a tle (<b>talose</b> epimerase) gene encoding an epimerase that converts dTDP-L-Rhap to dTDP-L- 6 dTalp. The K 11 and K 83 repeat units are the same pentasaccharide, consisting of D-glucose, l-Rha, l- 6 dTal, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, except that L- 6 dTal is 2 -O-acetylated in K 83. However, the K units are linked differently, with L-Rha in the main chain in K 11, but as a side-branch in K 83. KL 11 and KL 83 encode unrelated Wzy polymerases that link the K units together and different acetyltransferases, though only Atr 8 from KL 83 is active. The substrate specificity of each Wzy polymerase was assigned, and the functions of all glycosyltransferases were predicted. The CPS structures produced by three closely related K loci, KL 29, KL 105 and KL 106, were also predicted...|$|E
40|$|Galactinol synthase catalyzes {{the first}} {{committed}} {{step in the}} biosynthesis of raffinose sugars. Previous attempts to purify the enzyme have proven difficult and have resulted in low quantities of unpurified enzyme. Galactinol synthase was purified 752 -fold from mature zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Burpee Hybrid) leaves using sequential liquid chromatography on DE 52, Octyl-Sepharose CL- 4 B, and Sephacryl S- 200. This isolation scheme resulted in an 18. 6 % recovery of the initial activity. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 23. 3 micromoles per minute per milligram protein, a pH optimum of 7. 5, and the activity was enhanced by dithiothreitol and MnCl 2. The enzyme was only half as active with MgCl 2 as with MnCl 2. Na+, K+, and Ca 2 + cations {{had little effect on}} the enzyme activity, while Co 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, and Fe 3 + cations were strongly inhibitory at 10 millimolar concentrations. Purified galactinol synthase bound specifically to the substrates myo-inositol and UDP-galactose (Km = 6. 5 and 1. 8 millimolar, respectively), while exhibiting little affinity for an alternative glycosyl donor (UDP-glucose) or inositol epimers (epi- and scyllo-). Ten millimolar concentrations of UMP, UDP, UTP, AMP, ADP, ATP, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, UDP-xylose, and UDP-mannose, or 20 millimolar sucrose, <b>talose,</b> galactose, glucose, xylose, and melibiose exhibited various degrees of inhibitory effects. Twenty millimolar stachyose, raffinose, fructose, and mannose, and 10 millimolar UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-galacturonic acid had little or no effect on the enzyme activity.

40|$|A {{strategy}} to create cooperative hydrogen-bonding centers by using strong and directional intramolecular hydrogen-bonding motifs that can survive in aqueous media is presented. In particular, glyco-oligoamides, {{a family of}} DNA minor groove binders, with cooperative and non-cooperative hydrogen-bonding donor centers in the carbohydrate residues have been designed, synthesized, and studied by means of NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling methods. Indeed, two different sugar moieties, namely, β-D-Man-Py-γ-Py-Ind (1; Ind = indole, Man = mannose, Py= pyrrole) and β-D-Tal-Py-γ-Py-Ind (2; Tal = <b>talose),</b> were chosen according to our design. These sugar molecules should present oneor two-directional intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The challenge has been to study the conformation of the glyco-oligoamides at low temperature in physiological media by detecting the exchangeable protons (amide NH and OH resonances) by means of NMR spectroscopic analysis. In addition, two more glyco-oligoamides with non-cooperative hydrogen-bonding centers, that is, β-D-Glc-Py-γ-Py-Ind (3; Glc = glucose), β-D-Gal-Py-γ-Py-Ind (4; Gal = galac-tose), and the model compounds β-D-Man-Py-NHAc (5) and β-D-Tal-Py-NHAc (6) were synthesized and studied for comparison. We have demonstrated the existence of directional intramolecular hydrogen bonds in 1 and 2 in aqueous media. The unexpected differences in terms of stabilization of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds in 1 and 2 relative to 5 and 6 promoted us to evaluate the influence of CH-π interactions on the establishment of intramolecular hydrogen bonds by using computational methods. Initial binding studies of 1 and 2 with calf-thymus DNA and poly(dA-dT) 2 by NMR spectroscopic analysis and molecular dynamics simulations were also carried out. Both new sugar-oligoamides are bound in the minor groove of DNA, thus keeping a stable hairpin structure, as in the free state, in which both intramolecular hydrogen-bonding and CH-π interactions are present.
