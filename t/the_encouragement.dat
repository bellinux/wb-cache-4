To find out the actual use of <b>encouragements,</b> <b>the</b> authors first adopted the following two steps : 1) classroom video-observations of verbal encouragements by teachers in schools ranging from elementary to university level; and 2) a questionnaire survey to obtain students' attitudes and preferences toward <b>encouragements.</b> <b>The</b> frequency data shows that elementary school teachers tend to give more encouragements than those at other schools. Also, high school teachers are liable to provide fewer encouragements. Apart from teachers in junior high, teachers in senior high school and university directed more encouragements at individuals than at the whole class.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon <b>the</b> <b>encouragement</b> of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
