5|$|At a May Day rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation. The dispute led <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.|$|E
5|$|Pryce featured, {{alongside}} Kathy Burke and Minnie Driver, in the BBC serial Mr. Wroe's Virgins (1993), {{directed by}} Danny Boyle. Pryce played Henry Kravis in the HBO produced made-for-TV movie Barbarians at the Gate (1993). He {{was nominated for}} a Primetime Emmy Award and for a Golden Globe Award for his role. Also during 1993, Pryce starred alongside River Phoenix and Judy Davis in the unfinished film Dark Blood, but production had to be shut down when, 11 days short of completion, Phoenix died from a drug overdose. Director George Sluizer, who owns the rights <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> filmed, has made available some of the raw material, which features Pryce and Phoenix on a field in Utah, on his personal website. Between 1993 and 1997, Pryce, on a multimillion-dollar contract became the spokesman for the Infiniti automobile marque in a series of American television commercials, in particular for the Infiniti J30 and Infiniti Q45. In one of these advertisements Pryce appeared alongside jazz singer Nancy Wilson in a Prague nightclub. In 1994, Pryce portrayed Fagin in a revival of the musical Oliver!, and starred alongside Emma Thompson in the film Carrington (1995), which centres on a platonic relationship between gay writer Lytton Strachey and painter Dora Carrington. For his portrayal of Strachey, Pryce received the Best Actor Award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

The cooling effect would be similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> observed after the large explosive volcano eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.

25|$|Because the h-index {{was never}} meant to measure future {{publication}} success, recently, a group of researchers has investigated the features that are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its predictability. Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower compared <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> claimed before.|$|E
25|$|Between 1 January and 1 December 2011 {{there were}} 1870 {{intentional}} homicides in the municipality of Cali, {{which is considered}} a 5% increase compared to 2010. The surge in violence in Cali in 2011 has partly been attributed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as an ongoing 'mafia war' between the 'neo-paramilitary' groups Los Rastrojos and Los Urabeños, both involved in drug traffickiing. Los Rastrojos are considered the 'heirs' of the Cali Cartel and Los Urabeños have their roots in Colombia's coast. Los Rastrojos are accused of committing at least 80 murders in Cali in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Further <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{mentioned}} {{it should be}} stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will {{come a time when}} a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{different}} qualities are detected in first impressions may be linked <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> important to survival from an evolutionary perspective. For example, trustworthiness and attractiveness were the two traits most quickly detected and evaluated {{in a study of}} human faces. People are fairly good at assessing personality traits of others in general, but {{there appears to be a}} difference in first impression judgments between older and younger adults. Older adults judged young adult target photos as healthier, more trustworthy, and less hostile, but more aggressive, than younger adults did of the same photos. Older adults could have a lower response to negative cues due to a slower processing speed, causing them to see facial features on young adults as more positive than younger adults do.|$|E
25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many major}} American cities, Boston {{has seen a}} great {{reduction}} in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the United States Attorney and District Attorney's offices. This helped lead in part <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> touted as the [...] "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not {{one of them a}} juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the early}} {{manufacturing}} centers in the United States, many of Providence's tallest buildings were constructed prior to 1930, including 111 Westminster Street and the Turk's Head Building, {{one of the}} city's earliest high-rises. The city went through a second building boom in the 1970s, during which time One Financial Plaza and Textron Tower, the city's fifth-tallest building, were completed. In the 1990s and 2000s, due <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dubbed the Providence [...] "Renaissance", the city was the site of several notable high-rise construction projects; , there are still nine active high-rise proposals or construction projects taking place in the city. For the most part, the new projects have consisted of condominium and hotel developments, including The Residences at the Westin and the Waterplace towers.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of Savilian Professor of Geometry [...] was {{established at the}} University of Oxford in 1619. [...] It was founded (at {{the same time as}} the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, reacting <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described by one 20th-century mathematician as [...] "the wretched state of mathematical studies in England" [...] at that time. He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor. Edward Titchmarsh (professor 1931–63) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed. The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford since the late 19th century. Before then, for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century, the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane.|$|E
