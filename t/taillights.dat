5|$|The Original E-Series Clubsport was {{released}} in September 2006. The Clubsport had LED <b>taillights</b> and vertical front fender grilles only found on HSV E-Series models. Cloth trim was standard on Clubsport models with leather being an option.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{detection}} is {{an important}} process of many advance driver assistance system (ADAS) such as forward collision avoidance, Time to collision (TTC) and Intelligence headlight control (IHC). This paper presents a new algorithm to detect a vehicle ahead by using <b>taillight</b> pair. First, the proposed method extracts <b>taillight</b> candidate regions by filtering <b>taillight</b> colour regions and applying morphological operations. Second, pairing each candidates and pair symmetry analysis steps are implemented {{in order to have}} <b>taillight</b> positions. The aim of this work is to improve the accuracy of <b>taillight</b> detection at night with many bright spot candidates from streetlamps and other factors from complex scenes. Experiments on still images dataset show that the proposed algorithm can improve the <b>taillight</b> detection accuracy rate and robust under limited light images.

As abovementioned, the {{candidate}} red patches are detected by Section 2.1; then, each candidate red path can be paired as <b>taillight</b> pair by using geometric rules which is described in this section. Thus, the valid ROI region in the image frame is set with a fix region according to <b>taillight</b> pair.|$|R
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} dentition {{indicates that the}} <b>taillight</b> shark is the most basal member of its family and is sister to the clade containing all other dalatiid species. Although no definitive fossil remains have been found, the <b>taillight</b> shark may have evolved in the early Paleocene epoch (65.5 - 55.8 million years ago - Mya), {{as part of a}} larger adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks into midwater habitats. The teeth of the extinct shark Paraphorosoides ursulae, found in early Campanian (83.5 - 70.6 Mya) deposits in Germany, closely resemble those of the <b>taillight</b> shark.|$|R
25|$|In Brazil, the Neon was {{marketed as}} a luxury {{mid-size}} sedan; for Mexico {{it was a}} competitor to the Ford Escort, and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0L engine and European-style <b>taillights</b> (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style <b>taillights.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Century {{received}} a facelift for 1989, gaining a new more-rounded roofline, but continuing on the A-body platform. Black plastic inserts with the Buick trishield emblem replaced the rear quarter windows. The front end received flush headlamps and a rounded grille, and the stand-up hood ornament was now standard. All sedan models were easily distinguished by their distinctive full-width <b>taillights,</b> a somewhat extravagant flourish {{on a smaller}} sedan, but one that carried on a Buick tradition of big <b>taillights.</b> An interior refresh came in 1990.|$|E

25|$|The 1959 {{body style}} was {{continued}} through the 1960 model year, but the fins were toned down for 1960 and the <b>taillights</b> were moved {{to the bottom of}} the fenders.|$|E
25|$|At the 2016 New York International Auto Show, Chevrolet {{revealed}} the facelift North American {{version of the}} Sonic hatchback and sedan. The facelift brought a restyled front fascia, new LED <b>taillights,</b> and refreshed equipment.|$|E

30|$|The {{geometric}} rule-based filter {{was then}} employed {{to determine the}} <b>taillight</b> pair candidates. All <b>taillight</b> pairs were reserved in the second results. On average, less than five pairs in a single lane and less than 12 pairs in multi-lanes were needed for the further process as listed in the last column of Table  1.|$|R

25|$|The 1968 LeSabre {{received}} a minor facelift including new grilles and <b>taillights</b> along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.|$|E

25|$|The 1962 Buick LeSabre {{was only}} {{moderately}} {{changed from the}} previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and <b>taillights.</b> Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.|$|E
