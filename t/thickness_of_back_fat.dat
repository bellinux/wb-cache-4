The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if supplementation of soybean oil in the ration in order to increase conjugated linoleic acid of meat has concurrent effects on carcass characteristics and qualities of thin-tailed sheep. Sheep were fed fermented ricestraws supplemented with 0, 3 and 6 % soybean oil. The experimental design used was a Randomized Completely Block Design. Eighteen sheep with initial age of 6 - 8 months and initial bodyweight of 17. 46 ± 1. 61 kg were used. The treatments consisted of soybean oil supplementation 0, 3 and 6 %. Variables measured were carcass conformation, GR thickness, backfat thickness, subcutaneous fat score, and kidney and pelvic fat score. Result showed that sheep fed ration with 0 % soybean oil produced carcass with carcass conformation score of 8. 50 ± 1. 05, GR thickness 11. 50 ± 1. 05 mm, back fat thickness 2. 67 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55 mm, kidney and pelvic fat score 2. 00 ± 0. 00. Sheep feed ration with 3 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 8. 67 ± 1. 21, GR thickness 11. 67 ± 1. 21 mm, back fat thickness 2. 83 ± 0. 98 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and pelvic fat score 1. 83 ± 0. 4. Sheep feed ration with 6 % soybean oil; carcass conformation score 9. 00 ± 1. 26, GR thickness 12. 50 ± 1. 52 mm, back fat thickness 3. 33 ± 0. 82 mm, subcutaneus fat score 3. 50 ± 0. 55, kidney and pelvic fat score 1. 83 ± 0. 41. Score of carcass conformation, thickness of GR, <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat,</b> score of subcutaneus fat, and score of kidney-pelvic fat were not influenced by supplementation of soybean oil. In conclusion, suplementation soybean oil in the ration to increase conjugetaed linoleic acid has no significant concurrent effect on carcass quality characteristics of local sheep...|$|E

Female and male Kadon pigs were either housed individually or in groups and growth performance was measured. At {{the end of}} the feeding period, the pigs were killed and organ weights were determined. Carcass characteristics were measured as percentage ham and loin weight and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat.</b> There were 8 females and 8 males housed in individual pens for a period of 45 days. Another 8 females were housed together and so were 8 males, both females and males being kept for 90 days. The female pigs were heavier than the male pigs, the difference being most pronounced in the individually housed animals. For individually housed males with initial weight of 8 kg and final weight of 20 kg, average daily gain was about 290 g day - 1 and for the females with initial weight of 10 kg and final weight of 25 kg, it was 315 g day - 1. For the group-housed pigs {{there were no significant differences}} in weight gain, carcass weight, percentage of carcass and back fat between female and male pigs. The carcass weight was about 65 % of slaughter weight. The weight of head, tail, heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney and large intestine were not different between males and females, but the stomach and small intestine were heavier in females than in males. The loin meat contained about 8. 7 % fat and 21. 4 % protein as measured by proximate analysis. Palmitic and oleic acid represented about 26 and 40 % of the total loin fatty acids as measured by gas-liquid chromatography. There was no gender difference in carcass composition and fatty acid profile of meat. It is appreciated that the data presented will be affected by diet composition and management, but this study is the first to document reference data for Kadon pigs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} effect of the method of {{castration}} on the characteristics of pork and assess the effect of gender on the composition of a carcass. Carcass value is expressed in quantitative and qualitative characteristics that affect the value of the carcass. The quality of the carcasse is also involved internal factors which influence gender significantly influences the composition of the carcase and quality. Significant impact on meat quality in fattening male pigs have boar odor. Boar odor is strongly linked to surgical castration, which appears to be an effective solution for eliminating undesirable odors. Nowadays in the European Union there is a higher pressure on pigs welfare and thus to enforce the ban on surgical castration of piglets which is painful and stressful. Therefore is one of several options to eliminate boar odor using an immunological castration, which is nowadays the subject of many studies and brings very positive results. The purpose of our test was to compare groups of barrows, gilts, entire boars and imunocastrated boars and monitor the composition of the carcasses, meat quality and level of skatole and androstenone and confirm the hypothesis that the influence of various types of castration of boars, barrows and imunocastrated boars show different quality pork meat. Significant effect of gender on the composition of pig carcasses was proved whenboars and imunocastrated boars achieved the highest growth ability. On the contrary, gilts had the lowest growth ability. During fattening was determined highest daily gain in a group of barrows at favorable feed conversion and higher daily consumption compared to other groups of pigs. Also, barrows achieved best results in some parameters of carcass value, such as carcass weight and carcass yield of the hull on the contrary lean muscle ratio had the lowest percentage in comparison to other categories. Barrows were characterized by the highest <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat.</b> A higher ratio of back fat was also determined in the group of imunocastrates who are otherwise characterized by good growth ability and quality of the carcass hull, whose parameters equal group of boars. The immunological castration of imunocastrated boars caused weight reduction of sexual glands and stopped their physiological activity and that led to lower concentration of androstenone and skatolebelow the level of boar odor. Boar odor-causing substances exceeded the levels of acceptabilitytwice in the group of male pigs. The group of gilts was evaluated with best results in major meaty parts ratio of both weight and percentage of weight of the carcass of the hull. Gilts were characterized with the highest meat ration the leg and in the roast. Boars had the best neck ration and weight and imunocastrated boar had the best shoulders parameters.

The fattened pigs of the A group were produced from the domestic piglets, acquired by crossing various breeds and hybrid parental lines, bred in the Republic of Croatia. The fattened pigs of the B group were produced from the piglets imported from Hungary. All individuals were fattened on one family farm, on the Prefect District County of Brod and Posavina territory. The carcasses' quality traits were established by the "DT" method (NN 119 / 99).

Pig carcass quality is influenced by several factors before and after slaughtering. One of the factors that influences pig carcass before slaughtering is feeding. The right feeding can fulfill the pig needs and increases the pig carcass quality. The average weight of 27 pigs used on this research is 25, 59 ± 2, 67 kg and the research design is 3 ´ 3 complete randomize design which the first factor is zeolite rate (0, 3, and 6 %) and second rate is blood flour rate (0, 5, and 10 %), so we have nine treatments ransom (R 1 to R 9) with three repetition on each treatment. The result showed that zeolite rate on ransom did not affect any parameter (P> 0, 05) and neither the blood flour, except for the loin eye area larger than 10 % and without blood flour on ransom with the scores 31, 16 ± 4, 25; 27, 74 ± 3, 32, and 29, 18 ± 4, 85 cm 2.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{evaluate}} the influence of live weight on both the quantity and the quality <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> as well as on histology of adipose tissue in pigs. Fourty pigs of PIC genotype and equaly distributed sex were included in this study. The population was then divided into four sub-groups according to their live weight. (Groups: first - under 104. 9 kg, second - between 105 kg and 109. 9 kg, third - between 110 kg and 114. 9 kg, fourth - above 115 kg) 	The following indicators of fattening performance were monitored during the study: average daily feed consumption, average weekly feed consumption, average daily weight gain and feed conversion rate. Statistically significant influence was observed only for average daily weight gain which was found to be positively dependent on live weight increases. The smallest average daily weight gain (990. 14 g) was observed in group one which at the same time displayed highest feed conversion rate (2. 61 kg. kg- 1). Subjects in group four, on the other hand, showed the largest average daily weight gain (1159. 11 kg) and the lowest feed conversion rate (2. 49 kg. kg- 1). Furthermore, development <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> was periodically monitored via ultrasound examinations at three chosen points of the pigs' anatomy, beginning at four weeks of age and continuing until ten weeks of age. The measurements confirmed that the increases in depth <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> correlate closely with gains in live weight. No correlation was proven between other physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> and changes in live weight. However, measurements showed statistically non-significant increase <b>of</b> coloration <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> which correlated with weight gains for subjects under 114. 9 kg of live weight. As far as tenderness <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> is concerned, lowest values were found in both upper (74. 31 N) and lower (59. 61 N) fat in subjects in group two.

40|$|The aim of {{research}} work was to observe live weight {{and growth of}} piglets that came from 11 sows, cross-breeds the Large white x Landrase.

The measurements were carried out close to farrowing and at the date of weaning. For a consideration of found values <b>of</b> backfat <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> sows before farrowing we created 3 comparison groups: 1 st group contained animals with over body condition (overfat) where <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness was over 23 mm (5 pcs), 2 nd group was created by animals with optimal body condition where backfat thickness was from 20 to 22 mm (3 pcs) and 3 rd group created by animals where backfat thickness was less then 20 mm (3 pcs). Before farrowing of our particular groups of sows the backfat thickness reached these average values: 1 st group 27, 95 mm, 2 nd group 20, 67 mm and 3 rd group 17, 17 mm.

40|$|Reared in {{extensive}} parcels, 50 castrated or spayed Iberian pigs were fattened {{with conventional}} or high-oleic-concentrate diets {{to evaluate the}} effect of diet and sex on the measurements of the loin area depth, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness and its layers during the last 6  months before slaughter at eight time points in two anatomical locations by serial scans. The scan was the factor that had the greatest influence, followed by sex and diet. <b>Back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness at 10 th rib level was higher than at 14 th rib level. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the outer, middle and inner layers progressively increased over the study period. Throughout the experimental period, the differences between two successive scans of the M.  longissimus area did not differ significantly, obtaining the lowest value at the third scan and the highest at the fifth scan. The ultrasound <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> depth was affected by sex, being greater in females and in animals with a high-oleic diet. Positive significant correlations were observed for measurements assessed. The R 2 values for the regression equations to estimate M.  longissimus area were lower than the values found for the prediction of fat measurements, and they differed between sex and diet. The relative <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> growth was higher than M.  longissimus area, not permitting {{the establishment of a}} similar growth pattern for fat and muscle. The sex and diet was taken into account in the predictive models. The subcutaneous adipose layers in Iberian pigs grow at different rates during the last 6  months before slaughter; with the ultrasound serial scan, it is possible to show these changes. The change in diet and the sex affect the adipose tissue development, being more noticeable in the middle layer <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> at 10 th rib level and the inner layer at 14 th rib level. However, the sex and the use of an enriched oleic acid diet do not affect to loin development.

40|$|The {{influence}} of genetic type, lean meat percentage and sex on fatty acids (FA) composition <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> heavy pigs, reared {{for the production}} of San Daniele dry cured ham, was studied. One-hundred pigs of four genetic types - Large White or Duroc x (Landrace x Large White), GOLAND and DANBRED - were considered. They were randomly chosen during the slaughtering of 21 lots of heavy animals, in groups of four to eight subjects, balanced by sex, female and castrated males, and carcass leanness, U and R classes following the European grading system. Principal components (PCs) analysis showed that 94. 3 % of lot-diets’ FA variability was accounted for a five PCs model. The diet effect on the lard composition was weighted using the PCs scores as covariates in a tri-factorial (genotype, carcass leanness, sex) covariance design. Diet had a great effect on lard composition, indeed every examined <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> FA co-varied with the extracted PCs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness and the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness as an indication of the energy balance in dairy cows. For this reason 11, 055 cows of ten herds were investigated at regular intervals from 18 to 42 days by ultrasound scan. From this data collection results 85, 049 measures. These values were subsequently related to production variables to set limits usable in dairy herd management. The difference between net energy intake and net energy output is determining the energy balance. Therefore the energy balance is influenced by parity, dairy mass intake, time in lactation and milk yield. To avoid postpartal depression in performance the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness at dry off should be between 22 and 24 mm in herd average. With starting the lactation, the cows are in negative energy balance. This affects a decrease <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> down to 5 mm in some cows. The mean value of the herd should not be lower than 14 mm in early lactation. With the increase of the DMI and the decrease in milk yield in later lactation the fat reserve will be restored. This could be a reason for adiposis in herds with low production. Optimal conditions should be prepared until the beginning of dry period. Therefore the adequate feeding should be focused in the later lactation. The variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness is estimated from two ultrasonographic measures and the days in between. An interval of 26 to 30 days is the best period between two measures. Shorter periods lead to unacceptable findings in work. Longer intervals result in an inaccurate estimation of the mean value. During the dry period the daily variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness should be between 0. 0 and 0. 05 mm. Higher rates of anabolism in fat are connected with an increase of milk yield in early lactation but should be critically treated together with the backfat thickness. This should not be about 35 mm. Because of the reduced DMI and the increase of energy demand heifers start to lose condition 40 to 30 days before calving. The postpartal nadir affects a daily change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> about 0. 16 mm in herd average. A higher rise in lipolyses causes a decrease of reproductiveness. The nadir of the negative energy balance is between day 30 and 40 after parturition. After 110 days in milk the restore of fat depots should be started to prepare for the next lactation period. There are strong correlations between milk yield and change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness. A high milk yield in early lactation causes a high energy deficit. High producing cows catabolism can use up 0. 2 mm <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> per day. A higher rise in lipolyses leads to a significantly reduced reproductiveness. The increase of the daily change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness from - 0. 15 to - 0. 2 mm doubles the interval to first insemination. Likewise the intercalving periods degrades as well as the number of inseminations till the pregnancy. Despite of high milk yield an efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility. Milk solids secretion is strongly related to energy balance. Especially the milk protein content in early lactation has a significant correlation to the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness.</b> An average <b>of</b> milk protein below 3, 1 % is an indicator of an extreme energy deficit. These cows can lose up to 0. 2 mm <b>of</b> their <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> a day. The milk fat content is not strongly related to energy balance. The ultrasound scan <b>of</b> the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> can be an useful method to observe the condition in dairy cows. To solve problems in dairy herd management the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness is more suitable. For this purpose standard curves throughout lactation of this experiment can be used...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the ratio of ham and loin in half-carcasses and the tissue composition of these cuts. The research material consisted of 140 pig carcasses. The experimental materials were derived from the Polish commercial population of fattener pigs. Genetic material representing the most commonly slaughtered fatteners in Poland. Fatteners for the study came from several suppliers. All fatteners were kept in similar farms complying with principles of animal welfare. The right half-carcasses were divided into different groups, regardless of sex, half-carcass mass, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness and lean meat content class. Ham and loin obtained from carcasses were subjected to a detailed dissection, and the percentage of ham and loin in the carcass and the overall percentage of of the cuts in relation to the entire half-carcass were calculated. Gilts were characterized by a higher content of ham in half-carcasses than barrows (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). The increase in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness reduced the content of ham in half-carcasses and increased the content of loin (P ≤ 0. 01). A similar trend was shown for the lean meat content class parameter. Additionally, interaction (P [*]≤ 0. 01) between <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness and meat content with respect to the percentage content of loin in carcasses was noted. Gilts were characterised by about a 1. 38  % higher proportion of muscles in the ham (P [*] ≤ 0. 05) and a 0. 47  % lower proportion of intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). An average increase of five point in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness increases the amount of subcutaneous fat with skin (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and reduces muscle (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and bone (P [*]≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01) levels. The interaction of percentage content of muscles in ham was observed (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). The meat content class of carcasses did not only affect the level of bones in ham. It was confirmed that sex affected all the analysed dissection elements <b>of</b> the loin. <b>Back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and meat content classes were present in almost identical amounts in loin tissues (P [*] ≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01). Half-carcass mass showed a strong negative correlation with bone content in ham and loin (r [*]=[*]− 0. 35 and r [*]=[*]− 0. 21, respectively). <b>Back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness and meat content strongly and inversely correlated with the content of ham and loin in half-carcasses (r [*]=[*]− 0. 41 and r [*]=[*] 0. 59 for <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> thickness; r [*]=[*] 0. 66 and r [*]=[*]− 0. 57 for lean meat content).

40|$|The {{importance}} of ecological husbandry grows for some years. Nowadays 4 % of all farms in Germany are running under ecological managing. The milk production has a substantial {{meaning in the}} income of ecological farms. EU-regulations for ecological production are valid on all farms under ecological management in Europe since 1999. The guidelines of private agricultural associations match with these regulations or go beyond that. Important restrictions in the ecological dairy husbandry exist with the ban of several animal food and their additions like whole meal extraction from soy and rape as well as propyleneglycole, rumen protected fats and restricted use of concentrated food (40 %) in the ratio regarding to the dry matter. The use of performance and growth stimulants is also forbidden {{as well as the}} preventive use of chemical-synthetic medicine and antibiotics. The restriction of using chemical-synthetic allopathic medicine or antibiotics up to three treatments per animal and year and the doubling of the withdrawal period regulated by law need to be respected by the veterinarian. Using chemical-synthetic medicine without a legal withdrawal period on an ecologically managed farm, a withdrawal period of 48 hours is generally given. A great challenge after conversion to organic farming is meeting the nutrition requirements of cows with high milk yields and maintaining a good health status. An optimum in husbandry and adjusted stocking rates are important management actions to prevent diseases. From June 2003 to May 2004 regular measures of metabolism (blood/urine) and bag fat thickness were made in a dairy herd in Brandenburg, which changes to ecological farming since July 2002. The results of the monthly milk yield test and fertility measures of the herd were also analyzed. The performance of milk yield, fertility, animal health and parameters of metabolism should be obtained during the change to ecological management. On the farm 280 cows with an average milk yield of about 9000 kg milk and 250 young cows from own breeding were stapled. Food growing as well as feeding and husbandry proceeded within the ecological guidelines. Treatment of ill animals and marketing of milk and beef happened conventionally. The converting herd showed a significant decrease of milk yield and fertility. On the basis of metabolic examinations and concentrations of milk urea and protein, a lack of energy and protein supply is perceptible. The supply with ß-carotene and trace elements is not sufficient, either. The low values of heamatocrit and haemoglobin especially with the cows in early and high lactation are indications of lactation stress. The assessment of the body conditions by ultrasonographical measurement <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> shows a white spread <b>of</b> <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> in the herd with underconditioned cows as well as a tendency of adiposis in the dry period. Because of regular measurement <b>of</b> the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> the tendency <b>of</b> adiposis lowers with the dry and older cows {{at the end of the}} examination period. A better adaptation to the recommended reference values is detectable. Problems in animal health occur mostly in the fields of udder health and fertility. The increased occurrence of mastitis and placental retentions and puerperal disorders on the farm lead to a high number of treated cows. Claw diseases are important in this changing herd as well. Reasons for the decrease of milk yield and problems of fertility and animal health can be the incorrect body condition and the insufficient supply of the cows. The fundament for a strong metabolism, good yield and health is a sufficient feeding correlating to the performance of the herd. But within the ecological conditions, it is difficult to manage in herds with high milk yield. An optimally designed feeding management is the precondition for high intakes of dry matter and therefore a higher performance from basic feeding. Food analysis is important to prevent misjudgements of ecological animal food compared to conventional animal food because of the different contents of minerals and nutrients in the food...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of concentrate on the production of carcass and non-carcass components of feedlot ewes. Twenty-four crossbred ewes were randomly distributed in four treatments: diet with 20 %; 40 %; 60 %; and 80 % concentrate. Animals were slaughtered when those receiving the diet with 80 % concentrate reached adult live weight (50 kg LW). The data were analyzed by variance and regression analyses. The weights of the shoulder and leg rise linearly with the increase in the levels of concentrate, but shoulder yield was not affected, with an average of 16 %, and the leg yield reduced linearly (28 g for each 1 % concentrate added). The percentage value of the viscera reduced linearly, as well as those of head and paws. The non-carcass components represented values of 34. 64; 38. 60; 38. 55; and 39. 88 % of the LW for the levels of 20, 40, 60 and 80 % of concentrate, respectively.
