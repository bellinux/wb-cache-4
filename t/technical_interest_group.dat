Organizations involved in stimulating the activities on reliability by exchanging information or supporting research programs are described. Within one such program, ESPRIT, a <b>technical</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> on IC reliability {{was formed to}} formulate particular needs and necessary improvements in education and research. In addition to ESPRIT research projects, there are smaller projects on reliability subjects. Two examples, one dealing with plastic-encapsulation {{and the other with}} electrostatic discharge, are treated in some detail. Some achievements in the areas of oxide breakdown and plastic encapsulated ICs in temperature cycling are also presented. A few opinions are offered on trends in reliability engineering, including reliability circuit simulatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{cognitive}} engineering {{and decision making}} (CEDM) has grown rapidly in recent decades. At this writing, {{it is the largest}} <b>technical</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> within the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. Work that falls into this area of research and study is also widely practiced across Europe and in countries around the world. Along with this growth, there is a significant need for a peer-reviewed journal that focuses specifically on CEDM as a science and applied discipline. The Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making is intended to meet that need. It will cover current research, theory, and practice in ways that not only provide for the sharing of information across interested parties but also serve to move the field forward. This will advance theoretical bases; address outstanding scientific challenges; set new courses and directions; address methods, measurement, and methodological issues; and show useful applications of this work in the development of operational and training systems in many domains that are of significance to society, government, and business. In this article, we provide background on the CEDM field and its areas of research. We use this as a platform for further specifying the scope of this journal along three technical tracks...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the Nano@Tech Meeting on January 12, 2016 at 12 : 00 p. m. in room 1116 - 1118 of the Marcus Nanotechnology Building on the Georgia Tech campus. Manos M. Tentzeris {{received}} the Diploma (magna cum laude) degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens and the M. S. and Ph. D. degrees {{in electrical engineering}} and computer science from the University of Michigan. He has helped develop academic programs in highly integrated/multilayer packaging for RF and wire- less applications using ceramic and organic flexible materials, paper-based RFIDs and sensors, biosensors, wearable electronics, inkjet-printed electronics, green electronics and power scavenging, nanotechnology applications in RF, microwave MEM's, and SOP-integrated (UWB, multiband, millimeter wave, and conformal) antennas, and heads the ATHENA Research Group. He has been a Visiting Professor at the Technical University of Munich, GTRl-lreland, and LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse, France. He {{has served as the}} Head of the GT-ECE Electromagnetics <b>Technical</b> <b>Interest</b> <b>Group,</b> as the Georgia Electronic Design Center Associate Director for RF ID/Sensors Research, and as the Georgia Tech NSF-Packaging Research Center Associate Director for RF Research and the RF Alliance Leader. He is currently a Professor with the School of ECE at Georgia Tech. He has given more than 100 invited talks to various universities and companies {{all over the world and}} has published more than 580 papers in refereed journals and conference proceedings, five books, and 21 book chapters. He is the recipient of numerous awards, most recently the 2015 IET Microwaves, Antennas and Propagation Premium Award and the 2014 Georgia Tech ECE Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award. Runtime: 53 : 29 minutesIn this talk, inkjet-printed flexible antennas, RF electronics and sensors fabricated on paper and other polymer (e. g. LCP) substrates are introduced as a system-level solution for ultra-low-cost mass production of UHF Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags and Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) in an approach that could be easily extended to other microwave and wireless applications. The talk will cover examples from UHF up to the millimeter-wave frequency ranges. A compact inkjet-printed UHF "passive-RFID" antenna using the classic T-match approach and designed to match IC's complex impedance, is presented as a the first demonstrating prototype for this technology. Then, Prof. Tentzeris will briefly touch up the state-of-the-art area of fully-integrated wireless sensor modules on paper or flexible LCP and show the first ever 20 sensor integration with an RFID tag module on paper, as well as numerous 30 multilayer paper-based and LCP-based RF/microwave structures, that could potentially set the foundation for the truly convergent wireless sensor ad-hoc networks of the future with enhanced cognitive intelligence and "rugged" packaging. Prof. Tentzeris will discuss issues concerning the power sources of "near-perpetual" RF modules, including flexible minaturized batteries as well as power-scavenging approaches involving thermal, EM, vibration and solar energy forms. The final step of the presentation will involve examples from wearable (e. g. biomonitoring) antennas and RF modules, as well as the first examples of the integration of inkjet-printed nanotechnology-based (e. g. CNT) sensors on paper and organic substrates. It has to be noted that the talk will review and present challenges for inkjet-printed organic active and nonlinear devices as well as future directions in the area of environmentally-friendly ("green") RF electronics and "smart-skin' conformal sensors...|$|E

30|$|Against the {{background}} of this interpretation of the profound interwoven status of the individual in social and especially familial relationships, Knoppers and Chadwick ask the question whether a social obligation does not exist to demonstrate responsibility and {{to make his own}} data available to general medical research in solidarity with (potential) invalids. In addition, the question is asked of the general citizenry to consider the medical-ethical problem not merely from an individual viewpoint, but rather either from a perspective of an entire <b>technical</b> discipline, an <b>interest</b> <b>group,</b> or even simply from the viewpoint that is represented by the whole society and therefore would be related to positions that clearly exceed the individual limits of <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Finally, both indicate the principle of universality that a general obligation is derived from the commonality of genetic material of all humans to treat the weakness of genetic material constructively, not least through participation in studies which serve all of mankind (Knoppers and Chadwick 2005).|$|R

40|$|Recent {{attention}} to agricultural trade policy {{has turned to}} issues of technical barriers, particularly sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regulations, that constrain movement of products across international borders. It is intuitive that there are public good arguments that make some SPS restrictions necessary to insure a safe food supply and protect domestic animal herds and plant stocks from pests and diseases. In other cases, regulations rationalized on technical grounds seem to lack firm scientific foundations and appear, at least to potential beneficiaries of expanded trade, to be imposed primarily to shield domestic producers from competition. That such controversies arise is not surprising. Their likelihood {{is suggested by the}} economic theory of regulation, sometimes referred to as “capture ” theory. Applied to technical trade barriers, the theory suggests that when there is doubt about the merit of a <b>technical</b> restriction, domestic <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> will often succeed in obtaining protective decisions from domestic regulatory agencies. Both NAFTA and the WTO address issues of SPS and other technical trade barriers. Under NAFTA, it was agreed that each country retains the right to adopt SPS measures to protect human, animal, and plant life and health, that each country has the right to establish appropriate levels of protection, and that SPS measures must be based on scientific evidence, be non-discriminatory, and be applied only to the extent necessary.

40|$|In the Finnish {{statutory}} {{employment pension}} scheme all the pension institutions {{have a common}} <b>technical</b> <b>interest</b> rate for the pension reserves. This interest rate is determined for each year, and {{it may also be}} changed during the year. In all cases, the interest rate is decided in advance before the period in which it is applied and before the actual investment results are known for certain. The law prescribes that both the security of the pensions and the obtainable investment yield {{must be taken into account}} when the <b>technical</b> <b>interest</b> rate is determined. This paper describes the method that was developed by the <b>Interest</b> Rate Working <b>Group</b> in the year 1998. The maximum obtainable investment yield is estimated using the Markowitz efficient frontier model, which gives the optimal mean values of the investment yield associated with different standard deviations. The standard deviations are then connected with the level of the solvency margin by specifying the risk of fal-ling to a statutory solvency limit. The result is the expected value of the obtainable investment yield as a function of the level of the solvency margin. The interest rate is then calculated by including terms that take into account the growth rate of the reserves and the short term level of the yields. The method does not produce the <b>technical</b> <b>interest</b> rate directly but rather gives a basis to assist in determining the proper level of the interest rate. 395...|$|R

40|$|Building on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> {{and congressional}} {{committee}} literature, the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory is created to explicate {{the role of}} <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in congressional committee hearings. This theory applies {{not only to the}} influence <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> have in congressional hearings, but also to the access given to {{them to be able to}} participate. The theory maintains that <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> are necessary to legislators in this capacity since they provide valuable information relating to politics, elections and policy. Resource rich <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> with visibility as experts in a policy area are expected to be given more access and influence particularly to committees that are more balanced in terms of partisanship, ideology and leadership experience. Two statistical models test the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory, one looks at the access granted to <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> to participate in congressional hearings and the other at the influence wielded by the testimony they give in those hearings. A unique data set is developed for each model. The access dataset consists of attempts by <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> to testify before House committees during the 105 th, 106 th, 107 th and 108 th sessions of Congress, and consists of data compiled from the Lobbying Disclosure database. A unique dataset of coded congressional hearing testimony submitted by <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> from six committees and their subcommittees during the 103 rd, 106 th and 108 th Congress was created for the influence model. The research results indicate partial support for the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory. <b>Interest</b> <b>group</b> resources increase the likelihood of an <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> access. However, any advantages those resources are in gaining access to congressional hearings, they do not influence the likelihood of the committee adopting the recommendations given in testimony.
