It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{more to do with the}} actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
500|$|A 2011 {{exhibit at}} the Chadwick School {{featured}} photos of the school by both Wright and Adams. Two of Wright's children had attended the school. A critic writing for the Los Angeles Times praised Wright's work: [...] "In the Chadwick exhibition, it's Wright who trumps Adams with the show's most jaw-dropping image: a 1947 shot of five boys playing basketball on the school's outdoor court, {{against a backdrop of}} rolling hills and the Los Angeles Basin far below. It captures a moment of sheer ballet, the composition so gracefully perfect that one would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been choreographed by Balanchine — except that you can't choreograph players leaping for a rebound." ...|$|E
500|$|Edge and Eurogamer's Welsh faulted the {{morality}} system {{because they did}} not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> enough influence on the story. IGN's Ingenito called it [...] "woefully outdated", and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin's character. He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play-style, rather than crossing in-between. GameSpot's Mc Shea felt that {{the morality}} system was too binary because there was no [...] "moral gray area" [...] between playing good and evil. Polygon's Kollar reflected Mc Shea's opinion that the morality choices were too binary, and had difficulty connecting to his choices because they were too polarized between good and evil. OPM's Meikleham felt that the morality system had [...] "little to no impact on gameplay". Danny Cowan of Joystiq thought that the morality system was well-balanced, with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin's choices.|$|E

500|$|... "Bart the Mother" [...] was {{the last}} {{full-length}} episode David X. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen teamed up with The Simpsons creator Matt Groening to develop Futurama, where he served as executive producer and head writer for the series' entire run. Cohen's idea for the episode {{started out as a}} B story for Homer. In the original concept, pigeons nest outside Homer's window at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Burns exterminates the pigeons and Homer climbs out onto the ledge of the window, {{in the middle of a}} blizzard, to nest the eggs. Cohen said the idea [...] " [...] fit in anywhere", so he decided to pitch it as an A story instead, with Bart nesting the eggs instead of Homer. The Simpsons writer George Meyer thought the idea of Bart shooting the bird and simply nesting the eggs was too straightforward, and he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> [...] "enough of a twist" [...] to be a good episode. Cohen and Meyer eventually decided the eggs should be lizard eggs. Cohen thought the twist was what ultimately made the episode both [...] "touching" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> anything to do with why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|Designer Robert Fletcher {{was brought}} in to {{redesign}} existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of [...] "corrupt colors", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. [...] "They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way their indicate another time." [...] Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed, but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until [...] (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called trapunto. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of The Wrath of Khans production, the machines and needles needed to produce trapunto were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew was so worried about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been stolen.|$|E

2500|$|According to Joanne Sellar, {{one of the}} film's producers, {{it was a hard}} film {{to finance}} because [...] "the studios didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> the scope of a major picture". It took two years to acquire {{financing}} for the film. For the role of Plainview's [...] "son", Anderson looked at people in Los Angeles and New York City, but he realized that they needed someone from Texas who knew how to shoot shotguns and [...] "live in that world". The filmmakers asked around at a school and the principal recommended Dillon Freasier. They did not have him read any scenes and instead talked to him, realizing that he was the perfect person for the role.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Fo and Rame {{began their}} third theatre group, Collettivo Teatrale [...] "La Comune" [...] with the {{musician}} Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi. They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (capannone) in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting {{it into a}} sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non è servito a niente (I'd Rather Die Tonight If I Had To <b>Think</b> <b>It</b> <b>Had</b> All Been In Vain). Inspired by the Black September, with the title derived from a Renata Viganò poem, thousands of people came to see it.|$|E

On his way to Europe for a friend's wedding, Crowe came to London and met with producer Cameron Mackintosh. On meeting with Tom Hooper, he told the director about his concerns about playing Javert, and after meeting with him, Crowe was [...] "determined {{to be involved in}} the project and play Javert. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> something to do with Tom's passion for what he was about to undertake, and he clearly understood the problems and he clearly understood the challenge." [...] On visiting Victor Hugo's home in Paris, Crowe said, [...] " [...] told me about [...] Vidocq, a man who had been both a prisoner and a policeman, the man credited with inventing undercover police work when he established the Brigade de Surete." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 Steiner {{returned}} to the United States, where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. [...] He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Many disapproved of this charismatic [...] "firebrand with a foreign accent" [...] and questioned {{the relevance of the}} Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, [...] "Britain [...] didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain." [...] While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner's father objected, saying that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because [...] "I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father." [...] He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow at Cambridge in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... {{what seems to be}} the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?" [...] Kurtz said, [...] "Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of [...] category." ...|$|E
