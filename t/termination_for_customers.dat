5000|$|The {{transition}} of Qwest Wireless customers began in August 2008, initially focusing on customers {{who did not}} have other Qwest Services ("standalone" [...] wireless service). Customers who also had other Qwest services were allowed to [...] "migrate", but were not marketed to directly until October, 2008, when combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless billing was available. In October, 2008, Qwest began offering bundled billing, providing a combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless bill and discounting the Qwest services <b>for</b> qualifying <b>customers</b> who choose to add VzW to the Qwest bill. Financial terms of this agreement are not being disclosed. Current Qwest Wireless customers will be offered a comparable phone for free by Verizon, or the option to receive 25% off a different phone of the customers choice if they choose to move to VzW. Activation fees are also waived <b>for</b> migrating <b>customers,</b> as are early termination fees if the customer has a term agreement with Qwest Wireless. With the March 11, 2009 announcement of an end date, Qwest Wireless also discontinued the practice of charging early <b>termination</b> fees <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> who have term agreements with the carrier.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate if the Federal Government could realize cost savings through an analysis of contracts that have been terminated. A sampling of contracts from various Federal Government agencies was gathered and divided into two categories : <b>terminations</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons and <b>terminations</b> <b>for</b> non-financial reasons <b>Terminations</b> <b>for</b> financial reasons were analyzed with a bankruptcy prediction model, while a qualitative analysis was performed on <b>terminations</b> <b>for</b> non-financial reasons. From the bankruptcy prediction model analysis, {{it was apparent that}} the model was only somewhat useful as a predictor of <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> default. It was shown from the qualitative analysis that the Federal Government was predominantly at fault in <b>terminations</b> <b>for</b> convenience (95 % of the analysis sample) and that 66 % of the <b>terminations</b> <b>for</b> convenience in the sample were for reasons that the Federal Government could have controlled.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{technique}} to prove termination of multipath polynomial programs, an expressive class of loops that enables practical code abstraction and analysis. The technique is based on finite differences of expressions over transition systems. Although no complete method exists <b>for</b> determining <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> this class of loops, we show that our technique is useful in practice. We demonstrate that our prototype implementation for C source code readily scales to large software projects, proving <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> {{a high percentage of}} targeted loops. ...|$|R

Women resident in Mid Glamorgan who had had a termination between 1977 and 1981 because of positive findings after midtrimester prenatal diagnostic tests for neural tube defect or chromosome abnormalities were interviewed at home using a semistructured interview schedule. Three retrospective internal comparison groups were formed from those women who had also had a spontaneous abortion, previous stillbirth, or neonatal death or previous <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> medicosocial reasons early in pregnancy. Of the 48 women interviewed, 37 (77 %) experienced an acute grief reaction after the index pregnancy was ended. This reaction was akin to that documented after stillbirth or neonatal death. Twenty two women (46 %) remained symptomatic {{six months after the}} pregnancy had been ended, some requiring psychiatric support, compared with no such reaction after spontaneous abortion or <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> medicosocial reasons. All the women who had previously had a stillbirth or neonatal death were visited at home either by the general practitioner or by the midwife after that event but such follow up was limited to only eight of the study group after <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> fetal malformation.

40|$|Abstract. The most {{important}} open {{problem in the}} study of <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> logic programs is that of existential termination. Inthispaperwepresentapow erful transformational methodology that provides necessary (and, under some conditions, su cient) criteria <b>for</b> existential <b>termination.</b> The followed approach is to develop a suitable transformation from logic programs to Term Rewriting Systems (TRSs), such that proving termination of the obtained TRS implies existential termination of the original logic program. Thus, all the extensive amountofwork on <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> TRSs can be automatically used in the logic programming setting. Moreover, the approach isalsoabletocopewiththe dual notion of universal termination: in fact, a whole spectrum of termination properties, said k-termination,isinvestigated, of which universal and existential termination are the extremes. Also, a satisfactory treatment to the problem of <b>termination</b> <b>for</b> logic programming with negation is achieved. This way we provide a unique, uniform approachcovering all these di erent notions of termination. ...|$|R
