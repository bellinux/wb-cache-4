6000|$|... "Port! hard a port!" [...] cried our sailing-master. [...] "Clew up the topsails! Let <b>the</b> flying <b>jib</b> {{run down}}! <b>Back</b> <b>the</b> <b>jib</b> over <b>to</b> {{windward}} and {{run down the}} foresail!" [...] And so was our schooner Sophie Sutherland hove to off the Japan coast, near Cape Jerimo, on April 10, 1893.|$|R
60|$|He {{was quick}} to obey, and I found myself alone {{on the deck of}} the Ghost. As quietly as was possible, I clewed up the topsails, lowered <b>the</b> flying <b>jib</b> and staysail, <b>backed</b> <b>the</b> <b>jib</b> over, and {{flattened}} the mainsail. Then I went below to Maud. I placed my finger on my lips for silence, and entered Wolf Larsen’s room. He was in the same position in which I had left him, and his head was rocking—almost writhing—from side to side.|$|R
60|$|Night {{had fallen}} before they finished, {{and with the}} {{darkness}} came the storm. A low moan swept over the sea, and the wind struck the Sophie Sutherland flat. But she righted quickly, and with the sailing-master at the wheel, sheered her bow into within five points of the wind. Working {{as well as he}} could with his bandaged hand, and with the feeble aid of the Chinese cook, Chris went forward and <b>backed</b> <b>the</b> <b>jib</b> over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weather side. This with the flat mainsail, left the schooner hove to.|$|R
60|$|Shortly afterwards, a grey mass {{rose out of}} {{the water}} to port and he {{supposed}} it was Texada. There were mines on the island, and {{he might be able to}} engage a rescue party; but he reflected that he could not beat <b>the</b> sloop <b>back</b> <b>to</b> windward unless <b>the</b> breeze fell, which it showed no signs of doing. It would be more prudent to go on to Vancouver, where he would be sure of getting a steamer, but he closed with the long island a little, and dusk was falling when he made out a boat in the partial shelter of a bight. Standing in closer, he saw that there were two men in the craft, and driving down upon her he <b>backed</b> <b>the</b> <b>jib</b> and ran alongside.|$|R
