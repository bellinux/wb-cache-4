In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the dissolution-releasing characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>pollutants</b> in coal gangue, this article carries out soaking experiment of coal gangue in different wind erosion degree of XINQIU strip mine under different conditions. The {{results show that the}} main dissolution releasing <b>pollutants</b> of <b>the</b> coal gangue are total hardness (CaCO 3), sulfate (SO 4 2 -), natrium (Na), total dissolved solid (TDS), fluoride (F), CODMn, and total iron (Fe). Chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) occur in small quantities and heavy metals and arsenic (As) in trace concentration. The pH scale is nearly neutral. The higher the wind erosion degree is, the larger the quantity of <b>the</b> inorganic <b>pollutants</b> released by <b>the</b> gangue is. The quantity of <b>the</b> inorganic <b>pollutants</b> released by mixed coal gangue in high wind erosion degree inside the mountaintop is larger. Fluoride (F), oxygen consumed (OC), and total Fe are released by fresh mixed coal gangue in higher concentration. Soaking time, solid-to-liquid ratio, acidity, granularity and stirring {{have a significant impact on}} the dissolution-releasing of <b>the</b> <b>pollutants.</b> <b>The</b> longer the soaking time, the smaller the solid-to-liquid ratio, the stronger the acidity, the smaller the granularity and the faster the stirring intensity is, the quicker the rate of <b>the</b> <b>pollutants</b> dissolution-releasing is and the larger the total quantity of <b>the</b> <b>pollutants</b> is.

30|$|By {{replacing}} coal power, clean, non-polluting {{wind power}} can have significant environmental benefits by emission reduction of <b>the</b> <b>pollutants</b> generated by combustion of fossil fuels. <b>The</b> <b>pollutants</b> are related {{not only to}} global warming but also to other environmental impacts such as air pollution, acid precipitation, ozone depletion, forest destruction and emission of radioactive substances [18], which will further cause or exacerbate public health problems, including respiratory problems, skin disease, cancer, and so on.

25|$|In highly {{regulated}} developed countries, {{industrial effluent}} usually receives at least pretreatment if not full {{treatment at the}} factories themselves to reduce <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> load, before discharge to the sewer.

The same {{does not apply to}} many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of water}} and {{dispersion}} within the aquifer spreads <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> over a wider area, its advancing boundary often called a plume edge, which can then intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. Different mechanism have influence on the transport of pollutants, e.g. diffusion, adsorption, precipitation, decay, in the groundwater. The interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of hydrology transport models.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollutant}} emission factors are reported representative values {{that attempt to}} relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated {{with the release of}} that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.|$|E

25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} risk {{is a function}} of the hazard of <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.|$|E
500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{methylmercury}} is a globally distributed neurotoxin and an {{endocrine system}} disruptor. In the Everglades ecosystem, human pollution {{has led to}} increased concentrations of methylmercury, which have impacted the behaviors of the American white ibis. Hormone levels in males are affected, leading to {{a decrease in the}} rates of key courtship behavior, and fewer approaches by females during the mating season. In addition, methylmercury also increased male-male pairing behaviors by 55%. Both the chemically induced [...] "homosexual" [...] behavior and the diminished ability to attract females by males have reduced reproduction rates in affected populations. Exposure of American white ibises to methylmercury causes reduced foraging efficiency and it also makes them more likely to abandon nests owing to the disruptive effect of <b>the</b> <b>pollutant</b> on the bird's hormone systems, which in turn affects parental care behavior. Tests on captive birds have not shown a decreased survival of American white ibis exposed to methylmercury.|$|E
