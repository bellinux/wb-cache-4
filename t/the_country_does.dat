5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not currently face an external threat, they {{believe that it is}} necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E

In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team. In 2008, the situation for women's football in the Middle East was said by author Gary Brecher to be up there in popularity of freedom and democracy in the region. An all-women's school sporting competition was held at Effat University in 2010. The tournament was investigated by Saudi authorities because, according to Ahmed al-Zahrani, director of the Girls Education Department in Jeddah, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not have [...] "any regulations that say that it's okay for girl schools to hold sports classes or training".

2500|$|However, with Chad {{having only}} a 12.5M {{stake in the}} oil field, not much wealth was {{transferred}} to the country. In 2006, Déby made international news after calling for his country to have a 60 percent stake in the Chad-Cameroon oil output after receiving [...] "crumbs" [...] from foreign companies running the industry. He said Chevron and Petronas were refusing to pay taxes totalling $486.2 million. Chad passed a World Bank-backed oil revenues law that required most of its oil revenue to be allocated to health, education and infrastructure projects. The World Bank had previously frozen an oil revenue account in a dispute over how Chad spent its oil profits. Déby rejected those claims, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not receive nearly enough royalties to make meaningful change in the fight against poverty.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960s was {{a pivotal}} decade in the {{assertion}} of Aboriginal rights and a time of growing collaboration between Aboriginal activists and white Australian activists. In 1962, Commonwealth legislation specifically gave Aboriginal people {{the right to vote}} in Commonwealth elections. A group of University of Sydney students organised a bus tour of western and coastal New South Wales towns in 1965 to raise awareness of the state of Aboriginal health and living conditions. This Freedom Ride also aimed to highlight the social discrimination faced by Aboriginal people and encourage Aboriginal people themselves to resist discrimination. In 1966, Vincent Lingiari led a famous walk-off of Indigenous employees of Wave Hill Station in protest against poor pay and conditions (later the subject of the Paul Kelly song [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow"). The landmark 1967 referendum called by Prime Minister Harold Holt allowed the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to Aboriginal people by modifying section 51(xxvi) of the Constitution, and for Aboriginal people to be included when <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> a count to determine electoral representation by repealing section 127. The referendum passed with 90.77% voter support.|$|E

2500|$|Medical diploma mills have operated, {{and have}} been blacklisted, in the United States for over 120years. <b>The</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> not have a federal law that would {{unambiguously}} prohibit diploma mills, and the term [...] "university" [...] is not legally protected on a national level.

However, the Federal Trade Commission works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those {{in the field of}} education and alerts United States' consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page. [...] Under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by representing themselves as seminaries, since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Two former gay lovers, Pete, and {{the narrator}} of the novel Tim, are reunited when Tim needs a ride back to Los Angeles. They go on a surreal {{adventure}} over the next day-and-a-half, {{most of it in}} cars, with memories of the last twenty years, including tea rooms and bathhouses, increasingly enraging them at the AIDS pandemic destruction. Sleep deprived, using gallows humor and self-medicating with mescaline-spiked drinks they travel through an increasingly hostile environment meeting a bizarre and queer cast of supporting characters who fuel undercurrent rage at society's homophobia and the LGBT community's apathy. They meet an occult-obsessed indie filmmaker, leather-dykes, a Southern belle drag queen and then four anarchistic gays who are HIV-positive. The quartet reflect the hopelessness felt as their friends die and <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> little to counteract a [...] "gay" [...] disease. They hope to win the cultural war by assassinating ex-President Ronald Reagan, who did little for the first four years of growing HIV-AIDS epidemic, by bombing him at a church service. Tim and Pete convince the plotters to change targets to a meeting of the American Family Association, a group known for its anti-LGBT rhetoric that led to the failed response to AIDS, where there would be fewer [...] "innocent" [...] victims.|$|E
2500|$|James Reston Jr., in the Saturday Review, calls Lane's book disreputable, in {{that all}} of the reports {{contained}} in it are admittedly unverified, and lean toward the salacious. [...] "Lane makes no pretense of distinguishing between fact and a soldier's talent for embellishment", Reston observed. Commenting on the book's redeeming social value, Reston added that [...] "it would be to show that a pattern of atrocities exists in Vietnam, proving that while My Lai was larger, it was not unique. This needs to be demonstrated, since the Pentagon continues to insist that My Lai was an isolated case. [...] But the effort will have to be left to more responsible parties, like the National Veterans Inquiry." [...] A review of Lane's book by Neil Sheehan in the New York Times Book Review claimed that four of the 32 servicemen interviewed by Lane for the book had misrepresented their military service, according to the Defense Department. Lane responded to Sheehan’s inquiries by stating that the Defense Department is the least reliable of all sources for verification of atrocity accounts and that verification of simple facts about the interviewees was “not relevant.” Sheehan called Lane's book irresponsible, concluding that, [...] "Some of the horror tales in this book are undoubtedly true", and the [...] "men who now run the military establishment cannot conduct a credible investigation... But until <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>does</b> summon up the courage to convene a responsible inquiry, we probably deserve the Mark Lanes." [...] Because of Sheehan's review, Simon and Schuster reneged on the contract for the book. When Lane disproved Sheehan's charges, they were forced to settle with him.|$|E
