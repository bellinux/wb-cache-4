40|$|Summary: A rheolytic <b>thrombectomy</b> <b>catheter</b> {{was used}} to remove {{thrombus}} without thrombolytics from the sigmoid and transverse sinuses of a 34 -year-old woman. Using small, high-flow fluid jets and Venturi-effect suction, this catheter allowed mechanical removal of thrombus. This technique may obviate the need for thrombolytic agents and the risks associated with their use. A rheolytic <b>thrombectomy</b> <b>catheter,</b> a device us-ing high-velocity water pulsation to evacuate thrombus, {{has been shown to be}} a safe and effec-tive therapeutic technique for the removal of cor-onary artery thrombosis (1).

40|$|Background: Early {{clinical}} and retrospective angiographic evaluations indicated that {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction (MI), vulnerable plaques most often represented a mild luminal stenosis. More recent studies drawing upon prospective angiograms, however, have demonstrated that in majority of patients with acute MI, the underlying stenosis is significant.

Design. Comparative in vitro study. Materials and methods. A model of the ICA was filled with human thrombus, the ‘circle of Willis’ back pressure was set at either 10 or 30 cm of water. Five thrombectomy devices (Hydrolyser, Clot Buster, Acolysis System, AngioJet and Fogarty embolectomy catheter) were compared for (i) efficiency at removing thrombus, (ii) pressure changes {{at the tip of}} each device, and (iii) distal embolisation by flow cytometry. Results. Thrombus clearance was greatest with the AngioJet (median 95 %, range 92 – 97 %) and least with the Acolysis System (median 34 %, range 12 – 50 %). The Clot Buster and Hydrolyser were safest as they produced only negative tip pressures, the AngioJet and Balloon catheter produced positive and negative pressures risking distal embolisation. The Acolysis system produced no pressure change during use. Distal embolisation (of particles between 5 and 40 μm diameter) was greatest with the Fogarty balloon catheter at 10 cm water (P< 0. 05) and least with the Hydrolyser and Clot Buster. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Transradial {{approach}} (TRA) for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) is {{a common}} alternative to transfemoral approach associated with lower complications. However, a limitation of TRA {{is the use of}} large caliber guiding catheters due to the small size of the radial artery. The sheathless guiding catheter system that is in diameter 1 - 2 French (Fr) smaller than the corresponding introducer sheath may overcome these difficulties. Methods: From January 2010 through December 2010 in 5 Italian high-volume hospitals, 213 consecutive patients who underwent TRA-PCIs using the sheathless Eaucath guiding catheter system because of small radial artery caliber (Group 1) or undergoing bifurcation PCIs (Group 2) were enrolled in this registry. In patients of Group 1 (n = 79), a 6. 5 -Fr sheathless guiding catheter was employed, whereas in patients of Group 2 (n = 134) a 7. 5 Fr was used. Results: Among the 213 patients enrolled, 270 vessels were treated for 316 lesions. No procedures required conversion to a conventional guiding catheter system. There were significantly more female patients in Group 1, and they were, older, shorter, and thinner than patients in Group 2. No cases of major vascular complications were observed in either groups. During procedures, adjunctive devices employed included intravascular ultrasound, <b>thrombectomy</b> <b>catheters,</b> and distal protection systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using a 6. 5 Fr sheathless guide catheter as a default system in transradial (TRA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: TRA PCI has been shown to reduce mortality rates through a reduction in access site related bleeding complications compared with procedures performed though a femoral approach. Complications associated with the TRA route increase with the size of sheath used. These complications may be reduced by the use of a sheathless guide catheter system (Asahi Intecc, Japan) that is 1 - 2 Fr sizes smaller in diameter than the corresponding introducer sheath. METHODS: We performed PCI in 100 consecutive cases using 6. 5 Fr sheathless guides to determine the procedural success, rates of symptomatic radial spasm and radial occlusion. RESULTS: Procedural success using the 6. 5 Fr sheathless guide catheter system was 100 % with no cases requiring conversion to a conventional guide and catheter system. There were no procedural complications recorded associated with the use of the catheter. Adjunctive devices used in this cohort included IVUS, stent delivery catheters, distal protection devices, and simple <b>thrombectomy</b> <b>catheters.</b> The rate of radial spasm was 5 % and the rate of radial occlusion at 2 months was 2 %.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} {{and safety of}} a 6 Fr hydrodynamic <b>thrombectomy</b> <b>catheter,</b> the Hydrolyser, in native coronary arteries and aortocoronory bypass grafts. With use of a conventional contrast injector, saline solution is injected into the narrow lumen of the catheter which makes a 180 degrees bend at the tip. The resultant high-velocity jet (150 km/hour) is directed over a sidehole near the tip into a wide exhaust lumen. As {{a consequence of the}} Venturi effect, thrombus is sucked into that sidehole, fragmented, and removed through the wide exhaust lumen into a collection bag. Thirty-one thrombotic lesions were treated in 31 patients. The culprit vessel was a veneers graft in 21 patients (15 with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial [TIMI] grade 0 or 1 flow) and a coronary artery in 11 patients (9 with grade 0 or 1 flow). Twenty-six patients had angina New York Heart Association functional class III or IV heart failure and 5 an acute myocardial infarction. In 26 pattients, Hydrolyser therapy was the primary treatment, whereas in 5 patients coronary angioplasty preceded Hydrolyser therapy. In 1 patient the Hydrolyser could not reach the lesion. Thrombus was removed in 29 of the 31 patients. Successful reperfusion (TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow) by Hydrolyser therapy alone was achieved in 14 of the 24 patients with TIMI grade 0 or 1 flow before the procedure. Adjunctive therapy (coronary angioplasty, stent, or thrombolysis) was performed in 28 of the 31 patients, At the end of the total procedure 24 patients had TlMI grade 3 flow.

40|$|Vascular access {{blood flow}} {{monitoring}} reduces access morbidity and costs. BackgroundVascular access morbidity results in suboptimal patient outcomes and {{costs more than}} $ 8000 per patient-year at risk, representing approximately 15 % of total Medicare expenditures for ESRD patients annually. In recent years, the rate of access thrombosis has improved following the advent of vascular access blood flow monitoring (VABFM) programs to identify and treat stenosis prior to thrombosis. To define further both the clinical and financial impact of such programs, we used the ultrasound dilution method to {{study the effects of}} VABFM on thrombosis-related morbid events and associated costs, compared with both dynamic venous pressure monitoring (DVPM) and no monitoring (NM) in arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and grafts. MethodsA total of 132 chronic hemodialysis patients were followed prospectively for three consecutive study phases (I, 11 months of NM; II, 12 months of DVPM; III, 10 months of VABFM). All vascular access-related information (thrombosis rate, hospitalization, angiogram, angioplasty, access surgery, <b>thrombectomy,</b> <b>catheter</b> placement, missed treatments) was collected during the three study periods. ResultsDuring the three study phases, graft thrombosis rate was reduced from 0. 71 (phase I), to 0. 67 (phase II), to 0. 16 (phase III) events per patient-year at risk (P < 0. 001 phase III vs. phases I and II). Similarly, hospital days, missed treatments, and catheter use related to thrombotic events were significantly reduced during phase III compared to phases I and II. Hospital days related to vascular access morbidity and adjusted for patient-year at risk were 1. 8, 1. 6, and 0. 4 and missed dialysis treatments were 0. 98, 0. 86, and 0. 26 treatments per patient-year at risk for phases I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0. 001 for phase III vs. phases I and II). Catheter use was also significantly reduced during phases II and III, from 0. 29 (phase I) to 0. 17 and further to 0. 07 catheters per patient-year at risk, respectively (P < 0. 05 for phase III vs. phase I). Percutaneous angioplasty procedures increased during phases II and III from 0. 09 to 0. 32 to 0. 54 procedures per patient-year at risk for phases I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0. 01 for phase III vs. phase I). When the total cost of treatment for thrombosis-related events for grafts was estimated, it was found that during phase III, the adjusted yearly billed amount was reduced by 49 % versus phase I and 54 % versus phase II to $ 158, 550. Similar trends in reduced thrombosis-related morbid events and cost were observed for AVFs. ConclusionsVABFM for early detection of vascular access malfunction coupled with preventive intervention reduces thrombosis rates in both polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts and native AVFs. While there was {{a significant increase in the}} number of angioplasties done during the flow monitoring phase, the comprehensive cost is markedly reduced due to the decreased number of hospitalizations, catheters placed, missed treatments, and surgical interventions.

No grupo controle avaliou-se a evolução da tromboflebite sem qualquer tipo de intervenção terapêutica. Os animais do grupo tratado foram submetidos à trombectomia com cateter de Fogarty. Foram avaliados os parâmetros clínicos gerais, regionais, ultra-sonográficos e angiográficos, nos momentos pré-indução (M-PRÉ), indução da trombose (MTI) e 10 dias de evolução da trombose (M 10). A técnica empregada induziu a tromboflebite, que obstruiu completamente um segmento da veia jugular de todos os animais. Os animais do grupo controle mantiveram os trombos obstruindo totalmente o lume vascular até o final do período de avaliação, sendo que avaliações regionais mostraram principalmente o edema parotídeo e o ingurgitamento vascular, cranial à tromboflebite da veia jugular. O grupo tratado apresentou as veias jugulares pérvias ao final do experimento, confirmadas pelos exames ultra-sonográficos e angiográficos, com remissão total dos sinais clínicos. Concluiu-se que a técnica da trombectomia com cateter de Fogarty foi eficiente na desobstrução da veia jugular submetida à trombose experimental. Thrombosis of {{jugular vein}} {{is a common}} problem in the equine medicine, implying frequently in fatal outcomes. The diagnosis is relatively simple, based on the clinical findings, angiographics images and ultrasonographycs. The therapeutic employed {{to a large extent}} of the cases is unsatisfactory. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the applicability of the <b>thrombectomy</b> with Fogarty's <b>catheter</b> in horses. This technique is routinely used in medicine, in the reestablishment of the vascular perviousness. Ten horses were allocated in two groups (five animals each) and induced to an unilateral thrombosis of right jugular vein, through the surgical access and an application of stenotic suture and glucose 50 % injection. In the control group evolution of the thrombophlebitis without any therapeutical intervention was evaluated. The animals of the treatment group were submitted to the <b>thrombectomy</b> with Fogarty's <b>catheter.</b> General clinical parameters were analyzed at the moment of the preinduction (MPRE), induction of thrombosis (MTI), and at the 10 th day of thrombosis evolution (M 10). The procedure induced thrombophlebitis that completely obstructed a segment of the jugular vein in all animals. In the animals of the control group, the thrombus totally obstructed the vascular lumen until the end of the period of evaluation, and parotid edema and vascular dilated, cranial to the thrombophlebitis of jugular vein were observed. The treatment group presented all veins pervious in the end of the experiment, with total remission of the clinical signs, confirmed by angiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. So far, it was concluded that the technique of <b>thrombectomy</b> with Fogarty's <b>catheter</b> was effective in removal of the thrombosis obstruction experimentally induced in the jugular vein...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition {{with a high}} early mortality rate due to acute right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, an IV bolus of unfractionated heparin should be administered. In addition to anticoagulation, rapid initiation of systemic thrombolysis is potentially life-saving and therefore is standard therapy. Many patients with massive PE cannot receive thrombolysis because of an increased bleeding risk, such as prior surgery, trauma, or cancer. In these patients, catheter or surgical embolectomy are helpful for rapidly reversing right ventricular failure. <b>Catheter</b> <b>thrombectomy</b> appears to be particularly useful if surgical embolectomy is not available or the patient has contraindications to surgery. Although no controlled clinical trials are available, data from cohort studies indicate that the clinical outcomes after surgical and catheter embolectomy may be comparable.
