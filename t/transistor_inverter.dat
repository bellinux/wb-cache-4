50|$|Analog plasma cutters, {{typically}} requiring {{more than}} 2 kilowatts, use a heavy mains-frequency transformer. Inverter plasma cutters rectify the mains supply to DC, which is fed into a high-frequency <b>transistor</b> <b>inverter</b> between 10 kHz to about 200 kHz. Higher switching frequencies allow smaller transformer resulting in overall {{size and weight}} reduction.|$|E
50|$|DTC {{has also}} been applied to {{three-phase}} grid side converter control. Grid side converter is identical in structure to the <b>transistor</b> <b>inverter</b> controlling the machine. Thus it can in addition to rectifying AC to DC also feed back energy from the DC to the AC grid.

50|$|PN diodes {{also have}} {{transient}} behaviors {{that might be}} of concern with the design. The capacitance of a PN diode between anode and cathode is inversely proportional to the reverse voltage, growing as it approaches zero volts and into forward bias. There is also a recovery concern where the current will not decrease immediately when it is switched from forward bias to reverse bias. In {{the case of the}} diode OR if two or more of the inputs are at the 1 level and one switches to 0 it will cause a glitch or increase in current in the diodes that remain at 1. This can cause a short term dip in the output voltage. In practice if the diode logic gate drives a <b>transistor</b> <b>inverter,</b> as it usually does, and the diode and transistor are of similar construction the transistor will have a similar base collector capacitance that is amplified by the transistor gain so that it will be too slow to pass the glitch. Only when the diode is of a much slower construction will it become any concern at all. In one unusual design small selenium diode discs were used with germanium transistors. The recovery time of the very slow selenium diodes caused a glitch on the inverter output. It was fixed by placing a selenium diode across the base emitter junction of the transistor making it “think” it was a selenium transistor (if there could ever be one).|$|E

40|$|A {{control scheme}} for direct torque control (DTC) of a {{three-phase}} induction machine operating {{over a wide}} spread range is discussed. The DTC is based on deadbeat control of torque and flux utilizing the principles of stator flux field orientation. The stator flux can be calculated from the terminal quantities and the stator resistance. Variations in the stator resistance result in significant errors in the stator flux, especially at low speed. This problem is overcome in the proposed scheme by using the slip relation from indirect rotor flux field orientation to locate {{the position of the}} rotor flux.

40|$|Precise {{control over}} processing, {{transport}} {{and delivery of}} ionic and molecular signals is of great importance in numerous fields of life sciences. Integrated circuits based on ion transistors would be one approach to route and dispense complex chemical signal patterns to achieve such control. To date several types of ion transistors have been reported, however only individual devices have so far been presented {{and most of them}} are not functional at physiological salt concentrations. Here, we report integrated chemical logic gates based on ion bipolar junction <b>transistors.</b> <b>Inverters</b> and NAND gates of both npn type and complementary type are demonstrated. We find that complementary ion gates have higher gain and lower power consumption, as compared to the single transistor-type gates, which imitates the advantages of complementary logics found in conventional electronics. Ion inverters and NAND gates lay the groundwork for further development of solid state chemical delivery circuits. In ion transistors 1 - 4 the charge carriers are represented by ions and charged molecules. Since the mobility of these species is typically much lower than the mobility of the electrons and holes found in conventional semiconductors, ion transistors and circuits will never compete with traditional transistors in terms of speed.
