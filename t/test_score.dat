40|$|One current {{educational}} reform seeks to reward the "value added" {{by teachers and}} schools based on the average change in pupil <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> over time. In this paper, we outline {{the conditions under which}} the average change in scores is sufficient to rank schools in terms of value added. A key condition is that socioeconomic outcomes be a linear function of <b>test</b> <b>scores.</b> Absent this condition, one can still derive the optimal value-added policy if one knows the relationship between <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> and socioeconomic outcomes, and the distribution of <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> {{both before and after the}} intervention. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find a nonlinear relationship between <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> and one important outcome: log wages. We find no consistent pattern in the curvature of log wage returns to <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> (whether percentiles, scaled, or raw scores). This implies that, used alone, the average gain in <b>test</b> <b>scores</b> is an inadequate measure of school performance and current value-added methodology may misdirect school resources. © 2000 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. In all first-class matches in Australia, he scored 959 runs at 50.47.
