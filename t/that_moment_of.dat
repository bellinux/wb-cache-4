500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was really about the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E

[...] "What is the matter, maestro?" [...] they asked him. [...] "Do you miss home? Your family, perhaps?" [...] They advised him to capture <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> sadness in his music. Thus he conceived the theme of one of his most memorable works, Lágrima (literally meaning teardrop). After playing in London he came back to Novelda for his wedding.

After the game, he indicated that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. Although a few days later Madden indicated that the Raiders game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua's shoulder pads, Jack Tatum conceded that [...] "even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> impact."

[...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern.

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Michigan faced fourth {{down on its}} own 20-yard line with 19 yards needed for a first down from its own 20-yard line. Norm Purucker punted from deep in Michigan territory, and Yale's Gil Humphrey {{returned}} the ball to Michigan's 37-yard line. At that point, sports writer Allison Danzig of The New York Times wrote that Michigan [...] "looked to have met its master." [...] However, Yale was penalized for running into the kicker, resulting in Michigan receiving the ball with a first down at the 25-yard line. From that point, Tom Harmon led the Wolverines on a 75-yard touchdown drive that included three passes from Harmon covering 52 yards. [...] The game-winner was a short pass from Harmon to John Nicholson in the end zone. [...] John Brennan kicked the PAT. The United Press described the game-winning drive as follows:"Michigan seemed to be fighting for a hopeless cause and the hand crawled around the clock {{toward the end of}} the game.
