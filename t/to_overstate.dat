If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted <b>to</b> <b>overstate</b> the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

Because of her beauty and virtue, the earth is eminently lovable: heaven marries her not simply out of duty, but for pleasure and joy. Marriage and sexual intercourse are not merely human phenomena, but the universal power of productivity found within every level of existence: sex within marriage is the supreme instance of witnessing God in the full splendour of His self-disclosure.|$|E

He was born on March 21, 1806 {{in the village of}} San Pablo Guelatao and was full blooded Zapotec. He began his career studying to be a priest then a lawyer. In 1847, Juarez became governor of Oaxaca, but still faced stern opposition from conservatives such as Lope San Germán. With the success of the Plan de Ayutla, Juarez became governor again, and worked to remove privileges and properties from the Church and landed classes. The Constitution of 1857, was ratified in Oaxaca city, and Juarez left the governor's position to become President of Mexico. He was president during one of Mexico's most turbulent times, fighting invading French forces and conservatives. As a liberal, he imposed many of the reforms which remain today including those in education and separation of church and state. He is also considered to be a legend and a symbol for the indigenous population of the state.|$|E

Measuring the idiosyncratic volatility of 27 commodity futures contracts with traditional pricing models that fail to account for backwardation and contango leads to the puzzling finding that idiosyncratic volatility is significantly negatively priced cross-sectionally. However, idiosyncratic volatility is not priced when the phases of backwardation and contango are suitably factored in the pricing model. A time-series portfolio analysis similarly suggests that failing to recognize the fundamental risk associated with the inexorable phases of backwardation and contango leads <b>to</b> <b>overstated</b> profitability of the idiosyncratic volatility mimicking portfolios...|$|R

It employs the Calibrated Auction-Conjoint Valuation Method (CACM), by comparing non-adjusted values from a self-explicated (hypothetical) conjoint method to the final calibrated values entered into an adjusted (real) auction. We found consumers significantly reduced their WTP when moving from the initial stage of the CACM (hypothetical self-explicated conjoint method) to the final stage (real auction), primarily by placing more importance on product prices, implying that WTP values from a self-explicated conjoint method used alone would likely lead <b>to</b> <b>overstated</b> estimates of WTP.
