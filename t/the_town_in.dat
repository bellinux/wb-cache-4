40|$|Abstract. The {{safety of}} the water source area is the premise of urban safety and {{the basis for the}} {{sustainable}} urban development and urban-rural coordinated development. The contradiction between water source area protection and <b>the</b> development of <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water source area is increasingly prominent, and the restrictions of water source area protection on <b>the</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water source area have seriously restricted <b>the</b> development of <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> water source area.
