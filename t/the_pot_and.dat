5|$|The fenjaan {{was a big}} pot full {{of water}} and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> <b>and</b> the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E
25|$|Acoma pottery {{dates back}} to more than 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is {{essential}} to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened {{by the addition of}} pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side of <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> <b>and</b> hold it to their ear. If the pot does not ring, then the pot will crack during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the cook's taste.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1986, CBS adapted a {{theme that}} has affectionately been {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Pots</b> <b>and</b> Pans (because of the background notes often resembled <b>the</b> banging of <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> pans) theme. This particular theme was an intense, kinetic, synthesizer-laced theme. In 1989, <b>the</b> <b>Pots</b> <b>and</b> Pans theme was revamped to give it a more smooth, electronic style. This theme was also known for integrating the play-by-play announcer's voice-over introduction into the theme, it integrated three voice-over segments, one for the visiting team, home team, and game storyline to set the game storyline into the broadcast. This practice was common with CBS Sports themes of the 1980s.|$|R

25|$|If {{a player}} bets {{and all other}} players fold, then the {{remaining}} player is awarded <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> <b>and</b> {{is not required to}} show their hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best poker hand they can make from the seven cards comprising their two-hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of their own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form their final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be playing the board and can only hope to split the pot, because each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand.|$|E

Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
25|$|A nine-point game {{is another}} variant of match play {{typically}} played among threesomes, where each hole {{is worth a}} total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format {{can be used to}} wager on the game systematically; players each contribute {{the same amount of money}} to <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> <b>and</b> a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.|$|E

The cathode was packed into <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> <b>and</b> a carbon rod was inserted {{to act as a}} current collector. The anode and the pot were then immersed in an ammonium chloride solution.

2500|$|In South Africa, a potjie , {{directly}} translated [...] "pottle {{or little}} pot" [...] from Afrikaans or Dutch, is unlike most other Dutch ovens, {{in that it}} is round bottomed. Traditionally, it is a single cast, cast-iron pot, reinforced with external double or triple circumscribing ribs, a bail handle for suspending <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> <b>and</b> three short legs for resting the pot. It is similar in appearance to a cauldron. It has a matching handled lid, which is recessed, and convex to allow for hot coals to rest on top, providing additional heat from above. When the vessel is to be stored long term, care must be taken to avoid rust forming by seasoning. [...] "Potjie" [...] can also refer to the technique of cooking potjiekos.
