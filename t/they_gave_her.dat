5|$|Thirty-four {{months into}} her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her {{handcuffs}} for periods of time, though they kept her {{locked in the}} bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> cooked food for the first time. They informed her that they believed that she was pregnant. Age 13 and four-and-a-half months pregnant, Dugard had learned {{of the link between}} sex and pregnancy from television. At this time, while Dugard was raising her baby, Angel, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenage Dugard. Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care of her daughters using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures.|$|E

The assistant said it was to stop risk to the beads. In fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained.

25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
500|$|After {{her book}} was published, Brodie was {{contacted}} by some Eston Hemings Jefferson descendants who recognized {{his name from}} her account. They discovered that their fathers in the 1940s had decided that, to protect their children from racial discrimination associated with descent from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, they would tell the children they were descended from Jefferson's uncle. All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled [...] "Thomas Jefferson’s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences"], published in October 1976 in American Heritage magazine.

Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of Control as [...] "the birth of Janet the music video star, as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number." [...] Henderson commented that Jackson's dancing ability, trained by a then-unknown Paula Abdul, only served to propel her into further stardom. Charlie Minor, then-senior vice president of promotion for A stated: [...] "The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer... <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a face, dance, action identity with the songs, and a visual image of her as a rock 'n' roll star." [...] Jonathan Cohen of Billboard magazine commented [...] " [...] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix." [...] The video for [...] "Nasty" [...] received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul.|$|E

[...] USA Today also praised the album for its versatility saying [...] "The songs call for vulnerability (You Won’t Find This), urgency (Flat on the Floor), sympathy (Crazy Dreams, her co-written salute to “the hairbrush singers and dashboard drummers” from whose ranks she sprang), humor (The More Boys I Meet, the tag line of which goes “The more I love my dog”) and extreme role-playing (Last Name’s saga of a bar pickup that turns into an impulsive Vegas marriage). She delivers on all counts." [...] The Boston Herald gave the album a B, and claimed, [...] "Underwood manages enough spunk to occasionally avoid the cookie-cutter, especially with the curious beat-box-meets-banjo arrangement of [...] "Get Out of This Town" [...] and [...] "Just a Dream," [...] a bona fide [...] about a young war widow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entrepreneurs set up {{shops and}} {{businesses}} {{to cater to}} the miners. World-famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide. Prostitution was a growth industry attracting sex workers from around the globe, pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes; they had to send their earnings back to the family in China. In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, {{was one of the}} few who achieved [...] "respectable" [...] status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic; this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867; <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant. Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over, and the treatment of the women generally declined. It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma of East Coast cities. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later―as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived―did prostitution become less blatant and less common. After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, worked as laundresses and seamstresses, and strove for independent status.|$|E
