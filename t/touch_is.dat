5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (<b>touch)</b> <b>is</b> mostly used by lemurs in {{the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
30|$|Case one is {{that the}} first <b>touch</b> <b>was</b> truly {{intended}} and the second <b>touch</b> <b>was</b> unintended. Case two is that the first <b>touch</b> <b>was</b> unintended and the second <b>touch</b> <b>was</b> intended. And case three is that both the first touch and the second <b>touch</b> <b>were</b> unintended. In both case two and three, the unintended drawn ink stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for the first touch.|$|R
25|$|Playful aggression: Like playful affection these <b>touches</b> <b>are</b> used {{to serve}} to lighten interaction, however, the play signal {{indicates}} aggression. These <b>touches</b> <b>are</b> initiated, rather than mutual.|$|R
25|$|These touches {{serve to}} direct the behavior, attitude, or feeling state of the recipient. The key feature of these <b>touches</b> <b>is</b> {{that almost all of}} the <b>touches</b> <b>are</b> {{initiated}} by the person who attempts influence. These <b>touches</b> can <b>be</b> further classified as compliance, attention-getting, and announcing a response.|$|R
25|$|Henley’s (1977) {{research}} {{found that a}} person in power {{is more likely to}} touch a subordinate, but the subordinate is not free to touch in kind. <b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> a powerful nonverbal communication tool and this different standard between a superior and subordinate can lead to confusion whether the <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> motivated by dominance or intimacy according to Borisoff and Victor.|$|E

25|$|The McGurk {{effect was}} greatly reduced when {{attention}} was diverted to a tactile task (touching something). <b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> a sensory perception like vision and audition, therefore increasing attention to touch decreases {{the attention to}} auditory and visual senses.|$|E
25|$|Cat senses are adaptations {{that allow}} cats {{to be highly}} {{efficient}} predators. Cats have acute sight, hearing and smell, and their sense of <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their heads and bodies. These senses allow cats to hunt effectively in dim light and at night.|$|E
25|$|Social integration: <b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> {{widely used}} for social integration, a use that is typified {{by the social}} {{grooming}} of one animal by another. Social grooming has several functions; it removes parasites and debris from the groomed animal, it reaffirms the social bond or hierarchical relationship between the animals, and it gives the groomer an opportunity to examine olfactory cues on the groomed individual, perhaps adding additional ones. This behaviour has been observed in social insects, birds and mammals.|$|E

25|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> the {{earliest}} sense {{to develop in}} the fetus. The development of an infant's haptic senses and how {{it relates to the}} development of the other senses such as vision has been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.|$|E
25|$|From {{an artistic}} standpoint, {{these stories are}} rather laboured productions, besides being ultra-romantic in tone; {{but it must be}} remembered that they were written mainly with an {{educational}} goal, and, moreover, they deserve high praise for their style. Herculano had greater book-learning than Scott, but lacked descriptive talent and skill in dialogue. His <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> heavy, and these novels show no dramatic power, which accounts for his failure as a playwright, but their influence was as great as their followers were many.|$|E
25|$|The domovoi {{is also an}} oracle, as his {{behavior}} foretells or forewarns about the future. If he laughs, sings, jokes, or dances good times can be expected, and if he strums a comb there is a wedding in the future, but if he wails at night, extinguishes a candle or makes himself visible it means a family member, usually {{the head of the}} household, will die. The touch of the domovoi is also a harbinger. If his furry hand feels warm, good fortune is indicated; however, if his <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> icy cold, misfortune is coming.|$|E

25|$|More {{common than}} the {{sequential}} <b>touches</b> <b>are</b> the individual or single <b>touches.</b> They must <b>be</b> read {{by using the}} total context of what was said, {{the nature of the}} relationship and what kind of social setting was involved when the person <b>was</b> <b>touched.</b>|$|R
25|$|Depictions of {{the five}} {{traditional}} senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters. A typical example is Gérard de Lairesse's Allegory of the Five Senses (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a convex mirror, hearing is the cupid-like boy with a triangle, smell {{is represented by the}} girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and <b>touch</b> <b>is</b> represented by the woman holding the bird.|$|E
25|$|On the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, a touch-sensitive {{display feature}} called 3D <b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> {{incorporated}} into iOS 9. It {{is similar to}} Force Touch {{that can be found}} on the trackpad of some Apple MacBook computers. Quick Actions and shortcuts are added to apps that support the 3D Touch feature and are triggered by pressing slightly harder on the app icon. It also introduces actions known as Peek and Pop, which lets users firmly hold to preview ("Peek") at any kind of content in a hovering window, before they optionally apply more pressure to enter ("Pop") the content into full view.|$|E
25|$|The Zen Touch has {{a smaller}} form factor and larger backlit blue display in a curved {{industrial}} design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip {{on the front}} of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of Hitachi's smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The <b>Touch</b> <b>is</b> available in capacities of 20 and 40GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a removable battery, and plays audio for approximately 24 hours. Even though the battery is not removable, it can be replaced rather easily since the case is closed with screws only and the battery attaches with a connector.|$|E
