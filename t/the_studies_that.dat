5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E

It also established that investment decisions made by Sacco’s influence their performance. It also emerged from <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>that</b> Sacco’s need to invest in prudent projects {{in order to achieve}} better returns. It was also found that Sacco’s should put in place loan recovery strategies and introduce collateral securities as a way of eliminating or reducing loan defaulting. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> established <b>that</b> member withdrawal affects Sacco’s performance. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> concluded <b>that</b> Sacco’s should introduce more products in order compete with other organizations such as Micro finance Institutions...|$|R

25|$|The {{distribution}} of p-values {{for a group}} of studies is called a p-curve. The curve is affected by four factors: the proportion of studies that examined false null hypotheses, the power of <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> investigated false null hypotheses, the alpha levels, and publication bias. A p-curve can be used to assess the reliability of scientific literature, such as by detecting publication bias or p-hacking.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> {{conclude}} {{abuse is}} a bigger problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide empirical research (<b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for empirical research to investigate. Building a reading model based on empirical data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, {{and see how the}} interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further empirical studies. On the other hand, empirical research in eye-movements using eye-tracking {{is one of the most}} delicate measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition. Below is a brief summary of these reading models as classified by Nuthmann (2014).|$|E
25|$|Other studies {{concluded}} that the Tuskegee Syphilis trial has played a minor role in the decisions of black Americans to decline participation as research subjects. Of <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> have investigated the willingness of black Americans to participate in medical studies, they have not drawn consistent conclusions related to the willingness and participation in studies by racial minorities. Some {{of the factors that}} continue to limit the credibility of these few studies is how awareness differs significantly across studies. For instance, it appears that the rates of awareness differ as a function of method of assessment, study participants who reported awareness of the Tuskegee Syphilis Trials are often misinformed about the results and issues, and awareness of the study is not reliably associated with unwillingness to participate in scientific research.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} {{falconry}} have been traced to Mesopotamia and the earliest record {{comes from the}} reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC). Falconry made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the East after invasions by the Huns and Allans. Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194–1250) learned about Arabian falconry during wars {{in the region and}} obtained an Arabic treatise on falconry by Moamyn. He had this work translated into Latin and also conducted experiments on birds in his menagerie. By sealing the eyes of vultures and placing food nearby, he concluded that they found food by sight, and not by smell. He also developed methods to keep and train falcons. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> he undertook over nearly 30 years, were published in 1240 as De Arte Venandi cum Avibus (The Art of Hunting with Birds), considered one of the earliest studies on bird behaviour, and the first work known to include illustrations of birds.|$|E

25|$|Studies led by Holly Woodward, Jack Horner, Freedman Fowler et al. {{have given}} {{insight into the}} life history of Maiasaura, {{resulting}} in what {{is perhaps the most}} detailed life history of any dinosaur known, and to which all others can be compared. From a sample of fifty individual Maiasaura tibiae, it was found that Maiasaurs had a mortality rate of about 89.9% in their first year of life. If the animals survived their second year, their mortality rate would drop to 12.7%. The animals would spend their next six years maturing and growing. Sexual maturity was found to occur in their third year, while skeletal maturity was attained at eight years of age. In their eighth year and beyond, the mortality rate for Maiasaura would spike back to around 44.4%. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> followed also found that Maiasaurs were primarily bipedal as juveniles, and switched to a more quadrupedal stance as they aged. It was also found that Maiasaura also included rotting wood in its diet, as well that its environment had a long, dry season prone to drought. The results of the study were published in the journal Palaeobiology on September 3, 2015.|$|E
25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to rear children and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. <b>The</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E

500|$|In {{other cases}} gender {{differences}} have been exaggerated, potentially encouraging unjustified stereotyping. In recent works Julie A. Nelson has shown how {{the idea that}} [...] "women are more risk averse than men," [...] a now-popular assertion from behavioral economics, actually rests on extremely thin empirical evidence. Conducting meta-analyses of recent studies, she demonstrates that, while statistically significant differences in measures of mean risk aversion are sometimes found, the substantive size of these group-level differences tend to be small (on {{the order of a}} fraction of a standard deviation), and many other studies fail to find a statistically significant difference at all. Yet <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> fail to find [...] "difference" [...] {{are less likely to be}} published or highlighted.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the use of}} phylogenetic analyses, Coeluridae and Coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets {{used for}} small theropods that {{did not belong to}} other groups; thus, they {{accumulated}} many dubious genera. As late as the 1980s, popular books recognized over a dozen [...] "coelurids", including such disparate forms as the noasaurid Laevisuchus and the oviraptorosaurian Microvenator, and considered them descendants of the coelophysids. A wastebasket Coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources (and appears in at least one 2006 source) but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form. Coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015, when it was defined as all species more closely related to Coelurus fragilis than to Proceratosaurus bradleyi, Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis, Compsognathus longipes, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, or Deinonychus antirrhopus by Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus. It remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than Coelurus itself, and while Tanycolagreus is often included, support for this relationship has been weak in most of <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> recovered it.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, several peer-reviewed {{independent}} {{studies were}} published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure {{to return to}} the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD. Research also showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several data gaps not previously considered. Their review concluded, [...] "A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen." [...] Dave Goulson, an author of one of <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> prompted the EFSA review, has suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer Bayer Cropscience to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.|$|E
