Some of the letters [...] "CENTRAAL STATION" [...] that stood {{on the roof of the}} station until its closing were put in a different order by Peter Hopman and Margien Reuvekamp of Bureau Lakenvelder to read [...] "TRAAN LATEN" [...] ("SHED A TEAR"). The final closure of the outdated station took place on September 2, 2007, in the presence of Mayor Opstelten, to allow for the demolition of the station. Between 16 January 2008 and the end of March 2008 the station was completely demolished.|$|E

Sau- is a common emphasising prefix in colloquial German.

5000|$|Marcy {{is called}} to spell, and Rona, who has been announcing factoids about the spellers all along, announces that Marcy speaks five languages. Marcy reveals more about her {{stressful}} life, where she is pushed to succeed in everything, which she does not enjoy ("I Speak Six Languages").

[...] Jesus Christ then appears to her and teaches her that she is in control of her own life.

5000|$|According to Shane Embury, {{the origins}} of the project go back to the time Napalm Death were working on <b>the</b> <b>Words</b> from <b>the</b> <b>Exit</b> Wound album. In 2010 he told Kerrang!: I was hanging around with Nick Barker, who was playing drums for Cradle of Filth at the time. We were... getting drunk and {{listening}} to our favourite thrash, speed and grindcore bands. All the time we were just wanting to do something that was a return to the days of From Enslavement to Obliteration and World Downfall by Terrorizer. It was very quickly done, very spontaneous and based on energy and performance... With Lock Up we {{wanted to go back to}} the old days of thrashing a record out and recapturing that sense of early excitement.|$|R
40|$|The term {{community}} is commonly invoked in the literatures on “place ” and “natural resource decision-making. ” Upon careful {{examination of the}} place and decision-making research, though, it becomes increasingly evident that no shared theoretical foundation or common use of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> community <b>exits.</b> Such variations in conceptual orientations and use {{have led to a}} somewhat complex and cloudy knowledge base with respect to “community-place-and-decision-making” linkages. In this chapter, we articulate and apply principles from an interactional theoretical perspective of social organization, rooted in the writings of Harold Kaufman (1959; 1985) and Kenneth Wilkinson (1970; 1991) – and further elaborated upon by their colleagues and students – to the notions of community, place, and decision-making. We begin our discussion with the concept of place. Our point of departure is that place is a necessary but not sufficient condition for community. Place, as we show, has conventionally been an essential component in the study of community. As numerous authors have noted (e. g., Day 2006; Wilkinson 1991), place is where the search for community begins. Wilkinson (1991 : 23), for example, asserted that “[t]he local territory … is a logical place to begin the search fo...|$|R
50|$|Very commonly, {{an event}} causes only some {{internal}} actions to execute {{but does not}} lead to a change of state (state transition). In this case, all actions executed comprise the internal transition. For example, when one types on a keyboard, it responds by generating different character codes. However, unless the Caps Lock key is pressed, the state of the keyboard does not change (no state transition occurs). In UML, this situation should be modeled with internal transitions, as shown in Figure 6. The UML notation for internal transitions follows the general syntax used for exit (or entry) actions, except instead of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> entry (or <b>exit)</b> <b>the</b> internal transition is labeled with the triggering event (e.g., see the internal transition triggered by the ANY_KEY event in Figure 6).|$|R
50|$|On May 28, while heavy firing raged to the south, the Florida Brigade {{lay behind}} their own breastworks, {{awaiting}} {{the order to}} move forward. On the 6th Florida’s line, ColonelAngus McLean had finished explaining General Bate’s orders to his subordinates, and then stood atop the earthworks to observe the Federal line. With the hot sun beating down upon his brow, the young colonel turned to a soldier below, {{and asked for a}} swallow from his canteen. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> had just <b>exited</b> his lips when a Yankee skirmisher’s Minie bullet passed through his head, and McLean slumped backward into the entrenchments. One of his many relatives in the regiment passed the sad news to the folks in Walton County: “Mr. King caught him, I sprang to him & assisted in laying him down & {{for a minute or two}} supported his head with my hand. He never spoke or groaned. Closed his own eyes & died in a few minutes.” Lt. Col. Lafayette Kenan assumed command of the 6th Florida following his superior’s death.|$|R

Curs 2016 - 2017 Tutor: Manuel Cienfuegos MateoOn 23 th of June 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held in}} the UK to decide whether this country should leave or remain in the European Union. The leave option won 52 % to 48 %, with more than 30 million people voting. Their Withdrawal is widely known as Brexit, a combination between <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Britain and <b>Exit.</b> After the referendum, Britain got a new Prime Minister, Theresa May, who took over from David Cameron. Britain, already prepared to leave the EU by March 2019, has started the negotiations on the topic and Theresa May has already promised to create the ‘Great Repeal Bill’ to incorporate all EU Law to the UK domestic law. The two main issues are the withdrawal regulation applicable to the relations before the exit dare and the negotiation with the European Union of a new legal framework to govern their future relations. The withdrawal for the United Kingdom has already and will create legal consequences to both the UK and the European Union in big topics such as Commercial or Employment law, but most of all, in International Law and the relationship of the UK with the remaining EU members. This dissertation analyses the main aspects of the Brexit process and its legal issues...|$|R
40|$|Visibility of exit {{signs in}} terms of the height of the sign content was studied {{experimentally}} in an 18 m internal corridor. Four factors affecting the visibility including graphics, colours, lighting conditions and ages of the observers were investigated. Combinations of designations containing the English and Chinese <b>words</b> <b>EXIT,</b> five directional indicators and two exit symbols in different colours under normal and emergency lighting conditions were presented to 30 observers of different age groups to determine their visibility. The sign heights detected, identified and identified with confidence were measured. Increased height for correct identification was found for an exit sign containing two symbols as compared to a sign containing only one symbol. A green exit sign was reported to be highly visible. It was also reported that at reduced illumination, the sign height for correct identification increased. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
