5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and {{a section of the}} tree collapsed; the remaining part of the tree was pruned to reduce the weight of the surviving section.|$|E

5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> <b>and</b> lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E

5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
25|$|The trunk, {{particularly}} for older individuals, may be highly contorted, massive and gnarled. The crown is broadly rounded and dense, especially when aged 20 to 70years; {{in later life}} <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches are more well defined and the leaf density lower.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the present}} system, where each road (whether N- or R-) {{has a unique}} number, under <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> <b>and</b> Link Road system, Link Roads were {{numbered}} separately beginning with L1.

25|$|Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is {{characterized}} by rapid growth of lanugo hair, particularly on the face. Hair also appears on <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> armpits, while palms and soles are unaffected. The excess hair is {{commonly referred to as}} malignant down. This hair is very fine and unpigmented.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} a few muscles in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> the tail, but they are very strong and are {{essential}} for the bird. The pygostyle controls all the movement in the tail and controls the feathers in the tail. This gives the tail a larger surface area which helps keep the bird in the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{stem canker}} (Nectria galligena) {{produces}} depressed areas with concentric bark rings that develop on <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> branches. Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker. No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms include severe headache, a {{sustained}} high fever, cough, rash, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, sensitivity to light, delirium and death. A rash begins {{on the chest}} about {{five days after the}} fever appears, and spreads to <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> extremities. A symptom common to all forms of typhus is a fever which may reach 39°C (102°F).|$|E
