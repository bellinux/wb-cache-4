All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous. She was successful in warfare early in her reign, but generally {{is considered to be}} a pharaoh who inaugurated a long peaceful era. She re-established international trading relationships lost during a foreign occupation and brought great wealth to Egypt. That wealth enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a central {{character}} in the animated TV series , voiced by Venus Terzo. She is a popular soccer player and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. Jean is also a popular athlete of Bayville. She wears a black costume with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans {{found out about the}} existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her physic/psionic abilities for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were having a hard time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean appears to have a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control of her mind, so she could do the villain's bidding.|$|E

500|$|Following her {{collaboration}} with Ja Rule, Milian {{signed a deal}} with Island Def Jam Music Group in 2000. Milian traveled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album, working with the popular producers of that time. Milian collaborated with Bloodshy & Avant, Jermaine Dupri, Focus, Irv Gotti, Mark Hill, Montell Jordan and Evan Rogers. Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times later suggested that instead of launching her career off the success of [...] "Between Me and You", and by recording in Sweden without the [...] "platinum production touch" [...] of Irv Gotti, the owner of The Inc. Records, the momentum created by the song had evaporated. Milian received writing credit for eleven of the twelve songs on the album. It was during {{the production of the}} album that Milian had first started to write songs, and wrote about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could relate to at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Melody Maker {{columnist}} Sharon O'Connell {{said the}} album was [...] "the very best bit of fucked up rock 'n' roll [...] all year", and it was {{named one of the}} 20 best albums of the year by Spin in December 1991. Deborah Frost of The Village Voice, in her review of the album, called it [...] "genre-defying", taking note of Love's reputation on the album as [...] "the girl who won't shut up... She is all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should not be, and she shoves it, raw, right in your face." [...] The Seattle publication The Stranger took note of the album's production work by Gordon and Fleming, stating that [...] "despite Pretty on the Insides reputation as an unhinged, raw-sounding debut, a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together." [...] They also applauded Love's lyrics, and said the album [...] "judiciously toes the line between the evasively obtuse and overtly obscene".|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E

In 1989, she was named consultant to the Director of Veterans Affairs in Puerto Rico. In her position she became an activist and worked {{for the rights of}} the Puerto Rican women veterans.

2500|$|Kenneth Kitchen, {{author of}} the seven-volume [...] "Ramesside Inscriptions," [...] {{described}} Omm Sety as a [...] "true Ramesside" [...] who [...] "came {{to all sorts of}} conclusions about the actual objective material of the Sety Temple – which may have also coincided with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt she knew some other way...and that paid dividends. Donald Redford invited Omm Sety to appear in the documentary [...] "The Lost Pharaoh," [...] in which she gives her description of Akhenaton, including a negative view of the religious revolution he attempted (comparing him to the Ayatollah Khomeini – [...] "a fanatic"), a viewpoint broadly shared by scholars such as Seton-Williams and Redford.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the nature}} of her songwriting, Amos stated: [...] "My songs might be confessional, but I don’t like giving away too many details. One of the reasons I’ve made ten albums and {{maintained}} my family life is that I respect my own privacy." [...] She confessed, [...] "At times, I have used made-up characters to keep the media at bay." [...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, {{and there were a lot}} of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> really did discover. She found her voice...and then nine records later, the woman who is putting out Abnormally Attracted to Sin knows what she did with her voice." ...|$|E

She did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that." [...] On May 23, 1994, the funeral was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{he pitched}} {{the idea to}} ABC, other titles for the show {{included}} 40 and Single and The Courteney Cox Show, which was eventually named Cougar Town because Lawrence thought that [...] "the title is noisy and that people will be aware of this show". He felt {{that the risk of}} the title was that the audience wouldn't watch it because people would say [...] "the title bums me", commenting: [...] "it's a risky roll of the dice ... We don't call women 'cougars' in it. We certainly don't use the word beyond the unbelievably big cheat that the high school mascot is a cougar." [...] Lawrence believed that with the subsequent scripts they'd be doing and the reshoots in the pilot, the show would be [...] "creatively satisfying". After he pitched the idea to ABC, they asked him to have a pilot ready to shoot by the end of January 2009. Lawrence and Biegel together wrote the script with Lawrence, who has written and directed many episodes on Scrubs, directing the episode. In casting beyond Cox, Lawrence created the character of Ellie for his wife, Christa Miller. Miller felt that her character started off [...] "gleefully" [...] and reported that Lawrence would write down little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would say.|$|E
