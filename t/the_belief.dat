40|$|This short paper {{studies the}} problem of public persuasion, that is, when a sender has to persuade {{multiple}} receivers, possibly having heterogenous <b>beliefs,</b> with <b>the</b> same information for all.

This observation partially generalizes to targeted persuasion...|$|R

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that God exists or <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that God does not exist.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{cognitive}} agent programming languages {{that are}} based on the BDI model employ logical representation and reasoning for implementing <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> of agents. In these programming languages, <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> are assumed to be certain, i. e. an implemented agent can believe a proposition or not. These programming languages fail to capture the underlying uncertainty of <b>the</b> agent’s <b>beliefs</b> which is essential for many real world agent applications. We introduce Dempster-Shafer theory as a convenient method to model uncertainty in agent’s beliefs. We show that, using simple support functions as a representation for <b>the</b> agent’s <b>beliefs,</b> <b>the</b> computational complexity of Dempster’s Rule of Combination can be controlled. In particular, the certainty value of a proposition can be deduced from <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> of agents, without having to calculate the combination of Dempster-Shafer mass functions...|$|R
