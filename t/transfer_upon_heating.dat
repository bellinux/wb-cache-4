40|$|AbstractProlamin {{proteins}} {{are responsible}} for the network that gives wheat dough its viscoelastic properties. Non-prolamin depleted gluten was prepared under conditions that preserve its functionality. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) was used to provide information about the dynamics of the protein at temperatures between 5 and 90 °C by specific spin labelling of its cysteine residues. The spectra were of a composite type, resulting from at least two populations of spin labels largely differing in molecular mobility. The correlation time of the less mobile nitroxide radicals was determined by saturation <b>transfer</b> ESR. <b>Upon</b> <b>heating</b> there was a transfer from the slow to the fast moving population of radicals, and an increase of mobility of this last catagory that followed the Arrhenius law. The effect of temperature on molecular flexibility was reversible. This was not the case for purified, polymerised glutenin subunits extracted from gluten. Urea created similar modifications on gluten as heat...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{concentration}} changes of chemical species such as CO 32 -/HCO 3, amine/protonated species, carbonate/protonated species, carbamates/protonated species, etc. {{in the course of}} CO 2 absorption and those after CO 2 release <b>upon</b> <b>heating</b> at 93 °C for 30 min for aqueous blends of piperazine (PZ) and each of 11 tertiary alkanolamines using 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The initial rates of CO 2 capture of the blends ranged between 0. 125 and 0. 167 mol/L min, which were contributed by the rapid formation of PZ monocarbamate. A positive linear correlation was found between the CO 2 release amounts of the blends <b>upon</b> <b>heating</b> and the pKa values of the tertiary alkanolamines. The CO 2 content captured as PZ mono- and bis-carbamates decreased <b>upon</b> <b>heating</b> in the pKa range smaller than 9. 34, whereas it increased <b>upon</b> <b>heating</b> in the pKa range higher than 9. 55.
