5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply in <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days</b> and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} of two tropical waves and an upper-level trough {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by 12:00UTC on August2. The depression steadily organized after formation, intensifying into Tropical Storm Colin by 06:00UTC on August3. An abnormally strong ridge to the storm's north steered Colin to the west-northwest; reaching a forward speed up to 30mph (50km/h), the system was unable to maintain a closed circulation and instead degenerated into a trough by 18:00UTC that day. Over <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days,</b> the trough decelerated and recurved north into a weakness in the ridge while still producing tropical storm-force winds. Satellite imagery showed the reformation of a well-defined circulation by 12:00UTC on August5, and the system was once again classified as Tropical Storm Colin. After attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), an approaching trough sheared the cyclone and turned it northeast. Colin weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on August8 and degenerated into a trough for a second time twelve hours later; the trough dissipated early on August9.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1967, the NVA {{appointed}} Major General Tran Quy Hai as {{the local}} commander for the actions around Khe Sanh, with Le Quang Dạo as his political commissar. In <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days,</b> a campaign headquarters was established around Sap Lit. Two divisions, the 304th and the 325th, {{were assigned to the}} operation: the 325th was given responsibility for the area around the north, while the 304th was given responsibility for the southern sector. In attempting to determine NVA intentions Marine intelligence confirmed that, within a period of just over a week, the 325th NVA Division had moved into the vicinity of the base and two more divisions were within supporting distance. The 324th Division was located in the DMZ area 10–15miles north of Khe Sanh while the 320th Division was within easy reinforcing distance to the northeast. They were supported logistically from the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail. As a result of this intelligence, KSCB was reinforced on 13 December by the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. According to the official NVA history, by December 1967 the North Vietnamese had in place, or within supporting distance: the 304th, 320th, 324th, and 325th Infantry Divisions, the independent 270th infantry Regiment; five artillery regiments (the 16th, 45th, 84th, 204th, and 675th); three AAA regiments (the 208th, 214th, and 228th); four tank companies; one engineer regiment plus one independent engineer battalion; one signal battalion; and a number of local force units.|$|E

25|$|Weakened by the eighteen-month Blockade of the Gaza Strip, as of 31 December {{the central}} drug store {{reported}} that 105 drugs and 255 medical supplies {{of the essential}} drug and supplies list are still unavailable, and approximately 20 percent of the ambulances were grounded {{due to lack of}} spare parts.

25|$|The 2009 Redoubt {{eruption}} {{began with}} a series of large explosions on March 22–23, followed by less-energetic dome growth in the summit crater. On April 4, another large explosion occurred, which was in turn followed by growth of the current dome. There will likely be additional explosive events during <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days</b> to months, but their exact nature, as well as timing, remains uncertain. Because the dome sits at the lip of a steep slope leading out of the crater it can become unstable, and (as in 1990) collapse into the Drift River valley, producing avalanches of hot lava blocks, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and ash columns tens of thousands of feet tall, which can carry ash to Alaska communities. During periods between explosions, residents and pilots may also notice occasional sulfur smell and hazy conditions due to low-level ash and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning of}} 25 September 1598 the armies clashed {{in a major}} {{engagement}} at the Battle of Stångebro. Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund's men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight. Duke Charles won a decisive victory that forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms. Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament. Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured. These were later executed in the Linköping Bloodbath of 1600. The peace agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund at Linköping Castle. The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised {{that he had lost}} the political battle, fled during <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days</b> to Poland in late 1598. At {{the same time as the}} peace treaty was being signed in Linköping, conflicts were taking place in Dalarna. There, a pro-Sigismund bailiff, , had tried to raise up the Dalecarlians against Duke Charles. Chaos ensued, Näf was executed, and the Dalecarlians set out on the so-called Neaf Campaign (1598), burning and killing down to Brunnbäck ferry. In Västergötland, Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, illegitimate son of Duke Charles, defeated the rebellion.|$|E

500|$|In {{a meeting}} of Scots and Regulator leaders at Cross Creek on February 5, there was {{disagreement}} on how to proceed. [...] The Scots wanted {{to wait until the}} British troops had actually arrived before mustering, while the Regulators wanted to move immediately. [...] The views of the latter prevailed since they claimed to be able to raise 5,000 men, while the Scots expected to raise only 700 to 800. [...] When the forces mustered on February 15, there were about 3,500 men, but the number rapidly dwindled over the next few days. [...] Many men had expected to be met and escorted by British troops and did not relish the possibility of having to fight their way to the coast. [...] When they marched three days later, Brigadier General Donald MacDonald led between 1,400 and 1,600 men, predominantly Scots. This number was further reduced over <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>days</b> as more men deserted the column.|$|E

When Major James Denton's company of the 11th Battalion arrived at the hill they started digging in, and soon after received orders from MacLagen to hold the position at all costs. At 10:00 Turkish troops, advancing from Scrubby Knoll, got to within [...] of the Australians on the hill, opening fire at them.
