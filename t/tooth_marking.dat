40|$|Periodontal disease (PD) affects {{periodontium}} {{and thanks}} to its prevalence it {{is considered to be}} one of the most occurred diseases in small animals and even in human. The uppermost etiological agens presents bacterial plaque. Bacterial plaque strongly accumulate if it is not eliminated and it might be the cause of development of gingivitis or even periodontitis over time. The anatomy itself is relatively large, since the oral cavity is comprised of many kinds of tissues and a detailed description thereof would cover 70 pages at least. That is why the main aim of this work was to attempt to select the most basic information only. Due to dividing of anatomical structures into bones, soft tissues, salivary glands and teeth, the individual components of supporting apparatus (periodontium) are not described in chapter called,,periodontium,,. Here is explained its purpose and a description and function of periodontal ligament, which has not been included above. Particular attention was paid to the teeth. Determining the type and the number of individual teeth, the knowledge of their structure and the number of roots, all of that is important when it comes to a tooth extraction. The knowledge of <b>tooth</b> <b>marking,</b> dental formulas, identification systems and odontogenesis itself is equally important. As for each disease, the etiology is the essential part for understanding the formation of disease. Bacterial plaque, which adheres to enamel of teeth is regarded (as already mentioned) as initial etiological agens. It can mineralize in tartar in varying degrees depending on every individual subject (animal). There are involved other risk factors at onset of the disease such as age, breed, number and line-up of the teeth, their pathology, diet, but also some diseases. PD can be classified in two basic forms (gingivitis, periodontitis). Gum inflammation, or gingivitis, is often denoted as initial and totally reversible stage of disease. It is possible that there may not be present any symptoms or just slight redness at the beginning. Later stage leads to swelling, pain and significant bleeding, whereas it can manifest in periodontitis if therapy is absent. Periodontitis affects the entire periodontium and it is often called as an irreversible stage. Although thanks to guided tissue and bone regeneration it is possible to achieve at least slight improvement these days. In most patients disease passes into chronic form, causes them not only pain during eating, but may also result in various systemic diseases. A special form which affects younger individuals is called,,juvenile periodontitis,,. Diagnosis is primarily based on the medical history and examination of the oral cavity. Tartar index, gingivitis index, grades of tooth mobility and other parameters, which helps to determine the extension of disease and stage can be obtained using the intraoral radiographic, visual examination and measurement by periodontal probe. All collected information can be used to devise recommended therapy. The sole therapy depends on the state of the patient and the requirements of the owner. It consists of several steps. The essence is especially removal of any deposits of bacterial plaque and tartar, correction of teeth pathologies (smoothing rough surfaces) and tissues pathologies to eventual tooth extraction. As part of the therapy may also be chosen application of antibiotics and other preparations supporting wound healing. Many specialists have been developing new treatments over the past 10 years, but most of them are still not fully finished. These include the development of vaccines, photodynamic therapy, or guided tissue and bone regeneration, which were already mentioned. An integral part of therapy is home dental care. Without consistent home care there is a high probability of relapse. An important weapon against the rise of PD are various preventive measures. The most effective method of prevention is probably regular tooth brushing using a brush and a special paste made for animals. However, many owners prefer to avoid this method. They rather elect to feed dry diets, dental treats and other products which help to reduce the amount of plaque and tartar. Another option is a professional teeth cleaning performed by a veterinarian. A survey via questionnaire consisted of 16 questions, which were aimed at awareness of the disease, age, sex, breed, size, diet, preparations which help to control amount of plaque and tartar, systemic diseases and especially the presence of PD, age at first hit by disease, the circumstances of diagnosis, stage, treatment and relapse...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{bones from}} the Late Cretaceous of Alberta - including bones of large dinosaurs, a femur from the aquatic reptile Champsosaurus, and a dentary from the marsupial Eodelphis- that bear <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> made by animals with opposing pairs of teeth. Of the animals {{known from the}} Late Cretaceous of North America, only mammals are capable of making such <b>tooth</b> <b>marks.</b> In particular, multituberculates, which have paired upper and lower incisors, {{are the most likely}} candidates for the makers of these traces. The traces described here represent the oldest known mammalian <b>tooth</b> <b>marks.</b> Although it is possible that some of these <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> represent feeding traces, the <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> often penetrate deep into the dense cortices of the bone. This raises the possibility that, much as extant mammals gnaw bone and antler, some Cretaceous mammals may have consumed the bones of dinosaurs and other vertebrates as a source of minerals. However, none of the <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> described here resemble the extensive gnaw traces produced by Cenozoic multituberculates or rodents. This suggests that specialized gnawing forms may have been rare or absent in the Late Cretaceous of North America...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, {{controversial}} interpretations of the behavioral meaning of bone Surface modifications at FLK Zinj regarding primary or secondary access to carcasses by hominins have stemmed from the independent use of mark types (cut, percussion, and <b>tooth</b> <b>marks)</b> to evaluate opposing models. Such controversy has also been based on an over-reliance on <b>tooth</b> <b>mark</b> frequencies (mostly generated by non-hominin carnivores), which have been documented to be high when hyenids are primary bone modifiers, low when felids have primary access to carcasses, and high when suids feed primarily or secondarily on carcass parts. In addition, {{it has also been}} argued that the frequency of <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> on the FLK Zinj bones has been overidentified by some researchers, by mistaking <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> with biochemical marks created by plant roots. Some methodological approaches have hampered the use of cut marks to identify hominin behavior. Most of the reasons for purported equifinality of experimental scenarios are strictly methodological and are also caused by the separate rather than joint analysis of mark types. In the present work, for the first time cut <b>marks,</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>marks,</b> and percussion marks will be jointly analyzed, both experimentally and at FLK Zinj. Primary and secondary access to carcasses by hominins yields different frequency associations of all of these marks, which can be diagnostic of the type of access. Such mark-type relationships can only be detected when all mark types are analyzed simultaneously and not as separate sets. This multivariate approach provides a robust interpretation of primary access to carcasses by hominins at FLK Zinj...|$|R

Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between those of the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult Albertosaurus in mass. However, as the preservation of behavior in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. Phil Currie speculates that the Daspletosaurus formed packs to hunt, although this cannot be stated with certainty. There is no evidence of such gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|R

40|$|Fossils of extinct {{fur seals}} and {{walruses}} (Carnivora: Pinnipedia) occur within rich vertebrate fossil assemblages {{recovered from the}} shallow marine Mio-Pliocene Purisima Formation, central California. Two isolated postcranial bones—a humerus and a radius—belonging to a juvenile fur seal (Pinnipedia: Otariidae) exhibit circular depressions. These bone modifications are associated with radial and circular fractures, and are characterized by inward displacement of the cortex. These depressions lack features typical of erosive invertebrate borings, trampling damage from media (5 substrate) interaction, puncturing by another object during diagenetic compaction, such as a clast embedded or associated with the modification, or pathologic bone modification. These features are best interpreted as <b>tooth</b> <b>marks.</b> These <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> lack certain characteristics of commonly reported marks inflicted by shark teeth, such as linear gouges and subparallel scrapes formed by xiphodont and serrated teeth. These bone modifications instead exhibit a circular shape and inward displacement of the cortex, consistent with puncturing by a conical mammal tooth. The size and distribution of the <b>tooth</b> <b>marks,</b> {{in concert with the}} known vertebrate assemblage from the Purisima Formation, indicate several possible producers of the bone modifications: a pilot whale or beluga-like cetacean, a terrestrial carnivore, a dusignathine or odobenine walrus, or a case of infanticide by a conspecific otariid...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bitemarks were made in a carcass. As the bitemarks were made in body parts with relatively scantly amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a cadaver in which the more fleshy parts already had been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism.|$|R
40|$|Small {{carnivores}} and middle-sized mammals (mesomammals) are {{ubiquitous in}} fossil sites in South Africa, but their taphonomy is poorly understood. This study presents an actualistic investigation of bone modification by two captive small carnivores; the caracal (Caracal caracal) and honey badger (Mellivora capensis), housed at the Johannesburg Zoo. The carnivores were fed domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses as proxies for mesomammals and the bone {{modification of the}} resulting refuse and scatological assemblages were assessed {{in terms of their}} skeletal part representation, breakage patterns, digestive modifications and <b>tooth</b> <b>marks.</b> The investigation revealed that skeletal part representation and breakage patterns in the caracal and honey badger assemblages resembled those reported from other small carnivores. The caracal and honey badger assemblages were distinct from other carnivores in having overall light digestive modifications and a high frequency of <b>tooth</b> <b>marks.</b> Digestion was greater and <b>tooth</b> <b>marks</b> less frequent in the caracal than in the honey badger. Results were applied to the fossil assemblage of Cooper’s D which has a large assemblage of mesomammals and small carnivores. While a taphonomic analysis of Cooper’s D has not been published, initial results suggest that small carnivores had a great potential as contributors {{in the formation of the}} assemblage. The findings of this study emphasise the need for employing a variety of bone modifications in the identification of a small carnivore as an accumulator since there is rarely a single characteristic that is diagnostic for a particular carnivore...|$|R
