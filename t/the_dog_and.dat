5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first {{helicopter}} would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to {{the northeast corner of}} the compound and deploy the interpreter, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him.

5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E

5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>and</b> the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the seasons}} past, Granpa {{had begun to}} grow frailer, and {{eventually}} Emily is left alone with an empty chair and the old man's loyal dog.

5|$|Craig {{decides to}} take Jack {{to a doctor}} so that a vaccine can be created. During the meeting, Rudy Stagg, a man {{infected}} with POS who had been killing dogs in order to contain the outbreak, stumbles into their room. Rudy ignores pleas to spare Jack and shoots at her, but Logan dives in front of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> is shot instead. Logan suffers a collapsed lung and falls into a coma. He awakens weeks later and learns that Jack is on life support. He says a final goodbye to Jack before her life support is turned off. Jack's immunity to POS leads {{to the creation of}} a vaccine and cure, and Logan is finally able to reconcile with Robert, Craig, and Devon Wallacea childhood enemy whose dog died due to POS. The novel's epilogue, written as a newspaper article, reveals Logan and his family hold a private ceremony to honor Jack.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|Henson {{became famous}} in the 1960s {{when he joined the}} children's {{educational}} television program Sesame Street, and there helped develop characters for the series. He also appeared on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. In 1976, after scrapping plans for a Broadway show, he produced The Muppet Show. He won fame for his creations, particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf <b>the</b> <b>Dog,</b> <b>and</b> Ernie, and was involved with Sesame Street for over 20 years. Rowlf the Dog was a cast member on the Jimmy Dean Show in the early '60s. He also had frequent roles in Muppets films such as The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, and The Muppets Take Manhattan, and created advanced puppets for projects like Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth.

5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded {{out of the closet}} and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

5|$|On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles {{took over}} the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the {{development}} of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.|$|E

A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> <b>and</b> there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
