25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.|$|E

He {{published an article}} in the April 1928 issue of Harper's Magazine called [...] "The Possibilities of Large Telescopes". [...] This article contained Hale's vision for building what was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> understand and support his project.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of the 18-nation proposal, the United States {{proposed}} {{an association of}} canal users that would set rules for its operation. 14 of the other nations, not including Pakistan, agreed. Britain, in particular, believed that violation of the association rules would result in military force, but after Eden made a speech to this effect in parliament on 12 September, the US ambassador Dulles insisted [...] "we {{do not intend to}} shoot our way through" [...] the canal. The United States worked hard through diplomatic channels to resolve the crisis without resorting to conflict. [...] "The British and French reluctantly agreed to pursue the diplomatic avenue but viewed it as merely an attempt to buy time, during which they continued their military preparations." [...] The British, Washington's closest ally, ignored Eisenhower's pointed warning that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not accept a military solution.|$|E
2500|$|FairTax {{supporters}} {{assert that}} the proposal would make the cost of federal government highly visible as consumers would see most of this cost in a single tax paid every time they purchase a good or service. Under the current tax system, the federal government collects revenue through {{a wide variety of}} taxes on individuals and businesses. Thus the cost of government is spread out among many different avenues and may not be fully visible to individual citizens. For example, corporate taxes and compliance costs are passed partially from producers to final consumers when producers include those costs in the retail price of goods and services. The use of income tax withholding has also reduced the visibility of taxes. The U.S. Department of Treasury describes (in the history of the income tax) that withholding [...] "greatly reduced the taxpayer's awareness of the amount of tax being collected, i.e. it reduced the transparency of the tax, which made it easier to raise taxes in the future." [...] Proponents claim that the FairTax would greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the [...] "K Street tax lobbyist's" [...] ability to influence legislators to manipulate the U.S. tax code for the benefit of their clients. The FairTax legislation does not prevent future changes by Congress, however, due to the transparency of the FairTax, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be aware of changes to the tax base from exemptions because a change in tax rate would likely be reflected. [...] Congressman John Linder, the bill sponsor, is considering adding language to H.R. 25 during the 111th Congress that would require a supermajority vote of Congress to exempt any industry from the tax.|$|E

[...] The words fell {{from his lips}} with a fine {{unexpected}} austerity which imposed itself, producing a momentary silence, {{and it is a}} sign of Gaston's complete emancipation that he didn't in his heart resent this image of eventual favours denied his race. The resentment was rather Delia's, but she kept it to herself, for she was capable of reflecting with complacency that the key of the house would after all be hers, so that she could open the door for the Proberts if the Proberts should knock. Now that her sister's marriage was really to take place her consciousness that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have been resoundingly told so was still more agreeable. The party left the Hotel de l'Univers et de Cheltenham on the morrow, but it appeared to the German waiter, as he accepted another five-franc piece from the happy and now reckless Gaston, that they were even yet not at all clear as to where they were going.|$|E
