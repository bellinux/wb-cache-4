5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> man in the moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe {{on his back and}} the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

25|$|The Body: Neapolitan jackets {{tend to be}} shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> jacket “zompa arrèto,” which roughly {{translates}} as “it jumps in the back”. This characteristic allows for the jacket to “slide” gracefully along the body. The vents on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front {{go all the way}} down, to help the fabric follow the shape of the body and create elegant quarters.|$|E
25|$|The Witnesses' {{judicial}} process {{has also been}} criticized. Hearings take place in secret, with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor. According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but {{are not permitted to}} remain for the discussion. Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{had thought}} that invaders {{attacked}} {{the city in the}} 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class. Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. Some statues seem to have been destroyed methodically, with their fragments dispersed.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E

Thor arrives at Ægir's home and finds him to be cheerful, looks into his eyes, and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods. Annoyed, Ægir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in. The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere. However, Týr tells Thor {{that he may have}} a solution; east of Élivágar lives Hymir, and he owns such a deep kettle.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{received}} generally positive critical reception. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{said the}} songs on The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection were [...] "all crisp, cheerful arrangements that are suitably seasonal but also faithful to her bright country-pop." [...] Craig Shelburne of CMT said, [...] "Thanks to this teen star, {{a new generation of}} sensitive girls may discover the melancholy but oh-so-melodic 'Last Christmas'. She also includes two original holiday songs." [...] An uncredited review in Deseret News felt that the release was too short, with only 6 songs, yet fulfilled its task. Dan Maclntosh of Country Standard Time concluded, [...] "Swift is a fine singer, who finds ways to inject sincere emotion into every line she sings. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> best things come in small packages. And that saying holds true for Swift's new one." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Fischer {{achieved}} {{his second}} perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess {{players in the}} country: [...] "This tournament became, as <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> stuff of legend. The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise. The way he did it was spectacular." [...] "One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11–0 swathe through the field, to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now {{in a class by}} himself." [...] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine. Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, [...] "The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer". Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports' magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963–64 Championship is the only perfect score {{in the history of the}} tournament, and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it [...] "the most remarkable achievement of this kind". Fischer recalls: [...] "Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [...] Kmoch congratulated [...] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament...and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{of the two}} protagonists, Ko is {{in fifth}} grade in Part One and enters Seishu High School early in Part Two. Despite their age in Part One, he and Wakaba are very close and their {{families}} treat {{them as if they}} are a couple. While he shows little interest in baseball to outsiders, he has practiced daily at the Tsukishima Batting Center in the [...] cage and above since he was old enough to swing a bat. Ko is described by several other characters, including Ichiyo, Yuhei Azuma, and Junpei Azuma, as very like Aoba. In particular, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> two are both very competitive, and Junpei attributes their frequent squabbling to their similarities. After a sandlot game against Aoba's team in elementary school, Ko is inspired by her pitching form to become a pitcher himself, and at Wakaba's urging secretly adopts Aoba's daily training regimen. Although he does not play baseball in junior high school, Akaishi and Nakanishi convince him to join the high school baseball team. With his changeup pitches, control, and incredible fastball, he becomes the ace pitcher in Seishu High School, as well as a strong hitter. Ko describes himself as having no self-confidence and an excellent liar. Despite being at odds with one another, Ko and Aoba share a deep bond through their love for Wakaba. Ko takes to heart what Aoba has to say and values her opinion more than others.|$|E
500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that rapid {{increases}} in technology in recent decades are shortening {{the length of a}} generation. According to Strauss and Howe, however, this is not the case.
