25|$|Smith was the {{foremost}} urban {{leader of the}} Efficiency Movement in the United States and was noted for achieving {{a wide range of}} reforms as governor in the 1920s. The son of an Irish-American mother and a Civil War veteran father, he was raised in the Lower East Side of Manhattan near the Brooklyn Bridge, where he resided for his entire life. Like many other New York politicians of his era, he was also linked to the notorious Tammany Hall political machine that controlled New York City's politics, although he remained personally untarnished by corruption. Smith was a strong opponent of Prohibition, which he did not <b>think</b> <b>could</b> be enforced, and viewed it as an over-extension of the government's constitutional power. He was also the first Catholic nominee for President. His candidacy mobilized Catholic votes, especially from women, who had only recently received federal suffrage. It also brought out the anti-Catholic vote, which was especially strong among white conservative Democrats in the South, although Smith was still successful within the states of the Deep South.|$|E
500|$|Colfer's {{performances}} {{have been}} well received by critics, particularly [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye" [...] in the episode [...] "Born This Way". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic stated that the song was [...] "absolutely stunning in every conceivable way". She {{thought that he had}} the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability [...] "down pat". Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez also praised the rendition: [...] "Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than I recall. ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't <b>think</b> <b>could</b> have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble." [...] In his review, Michael Slezak of TVLine commended Kurt's voice and gave the song an [...] "A": [...] "I feel like we haven’t had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer’s countertenor to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit." [...] Rolling Stone Erica Futterman wrote that it was [...] "a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there".|$|E

500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you <b>think</b> <b>could</b> happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E

[...] Futterman thought that it was [...] "a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there." [...] Berk gave it three out of five stars and called it [...] "lovely, and properly sentimental". Zoller Seitz called the performance [...] "spellbinding" [...] and concluded, [...] "Chris Colfer turns 'As if We Never Said Goodbye' into a valentine to self-knowledge and self-improvement—and a young, gay singer's dream of treating the world as a stage and commanding it like a star." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Forsyth {{published}} The Phantom of Manhattan, {{a sequel}} to The Phantom of the Opera. It {{was intended as a}} departure from his usual genre; Forsyth's explanation was that [...] "I had done mercenaries, assassins, Nazis, murderers, terrorists, special forces soldiers, fighter pilots, you name it, and I got to <b>think,</b> <b>could</b> I actually write about the human heart?" [...] However, it did not achieve the same success as his other novels, and he subsequently returned to modern-day thrillers.|$|E

2500|$|Simon Poidevin in For Love Not Money writes that, [...] "At halftime we {{were leading}} 15-12 {{and it could}} have been 21-12 if a try equal in skill and drama to the Campese try at Wellington hadn't been {{disallowed}} for a forward pass." [...] Bob Dwyer in The Winning Way asserts the disallowed try could have cost Australia the Test, writing that, [...] "Towards {{the end of the first}} half Steve Williams went over the line at the end of a movement which had begun at the far end of the field, but the referee ruled there had been a forward pass three or four players earlier. That try, if converted, would have taken us to a lead of 18 to 6 and, I <b>think,</b> <b>could</b> have been the winning of the match.|$|E

Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, [...] "It was interesting." [...] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was [...] "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him..." [...] He adds, [...] "Mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It’s the best possible way to handle something that, I <b>think,</b> <b>could</b> otherwise be very uncomfortable." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the University, {{with its}} {{atmosphere}} of intellectual freedom and lively debate, Goncharov's spirit thrived. One episode {{proved to be}} especially memorable: when his then idol Alexander Pushkin arrived as a guest lecturer to have a public debate with professor Mikhail T. Katchenovsky on the authenticity of The Tale of Igor's Campaign. [...] "It was as if sunlight lit up the auditorium. I was enchanted by his poetry at the time...it was his genius that formed my aesthetic ideas – although the same, I <b>think,</b> <b>could</b> be said of all the young people of the time {{who were interested in}} poetry," [...] Goncharov wrote. Unlike Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, or Nikolay Ogaryov, his fellow Moscow University students, Goncharov remained indifferent to the ideas of political and social change that were gaining popularity at the time. Reading and translating were his main occupations. In 1832, the Telescope magazine published two chapters of Eugene Sue's novel Atar-Gull (1831), translated by Goncharov. This was his debut publication.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, the 50th {{anniversary of}} Buechner's ordination, Rich Barlowe wrote of Buechner in the Boston Globe, [...] "Who knows? The words are Frederick Buechner's mantra. Over {{the course of}} an hourlong chat with the writer and Presbyterian {{minister}} in his kitchen, they recur any number of times in response to questions about his faith and theology. Dogmatic religious believers would dismiss the two words as the warning shot of doubt. But for Buechner, it is precisely our doubts and struggles that mark us as human. And that insight girds his theological twist on Socrates: The unexamined human life is a lost chance to behold the divine." [...] In 2002, Richard Kauffman interviewed Buechner for The Christian Century upon the publication of Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say). Buechner answered the question [...] "Do you envision a particular audience when you write?" [...] by saying [...] "I always hope to reach people who don't want to touch religion with a ten-foot pole. The cultured despisers of religion, Sehleiermacher called them. Maybe some of my books reach them. But most of my readers, as far as I can tell, aren't that type. Many of them are ministers. They say, 'You've given us something back we lost and opened up doors we didn't <b>think</b> <b>could</b> be opened for people.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the role}} of Edward being cast for the 2008 Twilight film, Meyer opined that, {{although}} Edward was [...] "Indisputably the most difficult character to cast, [...] is also the one that I'm most passionately decided upon. The only actor I've ever seen who I <b>think</b> <b>could</b> come close to pulling off Edward Cullen is....(drumroll)....Henry Cavill." [...] When the film was optioned by Summit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated that; [...] "The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward", as Cavill was by then 24 years old, and thus too old to realistically fill the role. Meyer reported on her website that the four most popular fan suggestions for actors to play Edward were Hayden Christensen, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerard Way. On 11 December 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, had been cast in the role. Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment’s President of Production, stated: [...] "It is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident, with Rob Pattinson, that we have found the perfect Edward for our Bella in Twilight." [...] Meyer stated that; [...] "I am ecstatic with Summit's choice for Edward. There are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time, and even fewer who I can picture in my head as Edward. Robert Pattinson is going to be amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{scientific}} literature in the last 20 years has been unprecedented. For example, the library of medicine now includes {{more than two million}} Neuroscience articles. Anthony Landreth and Alcino Silva have developed a strategy to derive [...] (simplified abstraction) of published articles in Neuroscience that they <b>think</b> <b>could</b> be used to integrate and summarize with more clarity and objectivity what we know, what we are uncertain about and what we do not know in neuroscience. They propose that these maps of research findings would also be invaluable during experiment planning: Understanding more objectively the implications of the millions of neuroscience papers already published would allow neuroscientists to more clearly define what to do next. Landreth and Silva propose that quantitative maps of research findings will be to experiment planning in neuroscience what statistics is to experiment analyses: a tool that will help neuroscientists judge the likelihood that a series of planned experiments will contribute to the research record. As a first step towards the generation of these maps, Landreth and Silva developed a way to classify the many millions of experiments in neuroscience into a small number of categories that are critical for the generation of these maps. To generate these maps, Landreth and Silva also developed a set of algorithms that formalize strategies neuroscientists use to determine the strength of evidence in their fields. [...] These algorithms are used [...] to represent the experiments in networks of causally connected phenomena (i.e., research maps). Pranay Doshi and colleagues in the Silva Lab developed a completely free app (www.ResearchMaps.org) that helps researchers generate these maps. Data from individual research articles is entered into a relational database, and the app can generate maps not only for experimental findings in single research articles, but also for combinations of findings associated with different articles. The user can query the app and tailor-make specific maps that can then be used for experiment planning.|$|E
