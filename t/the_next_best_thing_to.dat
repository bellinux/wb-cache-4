This {{collection}} of hoary old standards is <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> testing that proposition directly." [...] Orange Coast praised Nelson's performance of the standards: [...] "Willie Nelson is perhaps the finest male singer in country music [...] his phrasing and sense of understated drama have caused him to {{be compared with the}} best jazz singers. Now he's released an album of old pop standards, Stardust (Columbia), and you can almost hear the stirrings of an outlaw uprising between the grooves [...] although is definitively no step forward in Nelson's career, it's still a pleasurable showcase of his considerable artistry as a vocalist. Plus even though he's dealing with the sophisticated likes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Kurt Weill, he remains essentially country".|$|E

2500|$|Vulture's Lindsey Weber {{felt that}} fans knew {{most of the}} details about the special due {{to the release of}} many clips prior to its premiere. She {{considered}} Minaj's appearance as one of the special's biggest changes and praised the scenes shot in slow motion as well as those showing the pair's daughter. In a positive review for Elle, Isabella Biedenharn called the special a [...] "predictable Carter propaganda" [...] with many [...] "lovey scenes" [...] occurring onstage between the pair and went on to praise Beyoncé's energetic performances. Jethro Nededog in an article for The Wrap opined that the [...] "'us against the world' imagery" [...] in the special denied rumours about the pair's divorce. He chose the performance of Lauryn Hill's [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] by Beyoncé as a show highlight. Chris Eggertsen from HitFix noted that most of the viewers watched the special because Beyoncé was featured in it. The A.V. Clubs writer Joshua Alston deemed the special a tribute to the pair's romance and felt it was [...] "handsomely shot... offering <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> being there for anyone who couldn't get a line of credit approved in time to buy the exorbitant tickets", while further praising the concert itself. He went on to laud the pair's chemistry on the stage and during their joint performances. However, he finished his review in a more mixed note, writing [...] "But for anyone who's more interested in the Carters the less pristine they appear to be, On The Run is like being served a 60-pound steak after you've already filled up on sizzle." [...] The concert special was nominated in the category for Best Music Film at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.|$|E
