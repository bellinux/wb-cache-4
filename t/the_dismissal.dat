5|$|The 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, {{also known}} simply as <b>the</b> <b>Dismissal,</b> {{has been described as}} the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history. It culminated on 11 November 1975 with <b>the</b> <b>dismissal</b> from office of the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, who then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser of the Liberal Party, as caretaker Prime Minister.|$|E

Those rights are determined by national law, and there is no general rule of specific performance. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>dismissals</b> were effective.|$|R
5000|$|Kinan's lawyer {{objected to}} <b>the</b> <b>dismissals.</b> <b>The</b> {{investigating}} judge had postponed Kinan's testimony repeatedly, and eventually dismissed the three without evidence from Kinan.

[...] She appealed <b>the</b> <b>dismissals,</b> but they were sustained and the trial headed for the court date with only three defendants.|$|R

50|$|In December 2006, Bush {{dismissed}} eight United States Attorneys. Though these attorneys {{serve at}} {{the pleasure of}} the president, <b>the</b> large-scale mid-term <b>dismissal</b> was without precedent, and Bush faced accusations that he had dismissed the attorneys for purely political reasons. During the 2006 elections, several Republican officials complained that the U.S. attorneys had not sufficiently investigated voter fraud. With the encouragement of Harriet Miers and Karl Rove, Attorney General Gonzales dismissed eight U.S. attorneys who were considered insufficiently supportive of the administration's policies. Though Gonzales argued that the attorneys had been fired for performance reasons, publicly released documents showed that the attorneys were dismissed for political reasons. After Gonzales testified before the Senate in April 2007, several Senators from both parties asked Gonzales to resign. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>dismissals</b> and <b>the</b> subsequent congressional investigations, Rove and Gonzales both resigned. A 2008 report found from the Justice Department inspector general found that <b>the</b> <b>dismissals</b> had been politically motivated, but a special counsel found that no crimes had been committed and no one was ever prosecuted in connection to <b>the</b> <b>dismissals.</b>|$|R

5|$|The F-FDTL's {{problems}} {{came to a}} head in 2006 when {{almost half}} the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. <b>The</b> <b>dismissal</b> contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dismissal</b> led to only minor {{constitutional}} change. The Senate retained {{its power to}} block supply, and the Governor-General the power to dismiss government ministers. However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. Kerr was widely criticised by ALP supporters for his actions, resigned early as Governor-General, and lived much of his remaining life abroad.|$|E
