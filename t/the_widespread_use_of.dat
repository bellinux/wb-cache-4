5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Folk metal is {{a fusion}} genre of heavy metal music and {{traditional}} folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> folk instruments and, {{to a lesser}} extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{poliovirus}} vaccine in the mid-1950s, {{the incidence}} of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have {{reduced the number of}} annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E
50|$|A few halocarbons, {{including}} acid halides like acetyl chloride, {{are highly}} reactive; these are rarely found outside chemical processing. <b>The</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> halocarbons were often driven by observations {{that most of}} them were more stable than other substances.

2500|$|The {{extensive}} production industrialisation {{that resulted}} was not responsive to consumer needs and caused a neglect {{in the service}} sector, unprecedented rapid urbanisation, acute urban overcrowding, chronic shortages and massive recruitment of women into mostly menial and/or low-paid occupations. [...] The consequent strains resulted in <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>used</b> <b>of</b> coercion, repression, show trials, purges and intimidation. [...] By 1960, massive urbanisation occurred in Poland (48% urban) and Bulgaria (38%), which increased employment for peasants, but also caused illiteracy to skyrocket when children left school for work.|$|R
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{antipsychotic}} drugs {{has long}} been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive {{by people who have}} to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} began <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{psychiatric treatment}} {{as a form}} of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

5|$|Manchester's {{buildings}} {{display a}} variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. <b>The</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre is {{a large number of}} former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered {{to be one of the}} most important Victorian buildings in England.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|While its diet {{consists}} {{almost exclusively}} of medium-sized birds, the peregrine will occasionally hunt small mammals, small reptiles, or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it mates {{for life and}} nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures. The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> certain pesticides, especially DDT. Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. <b>The</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{project of}} castle-building was also initiated, {{under the direction}} of Master James of Saint George, a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in Savoy on his return from the crusade. These included the castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech, intended to act both as fortresses and royal palaces for the King. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the concentric castle, and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design. The castles made a clear, imperial statement about Edward's intentions to rule North Wales permanently, and drew on imagery associated with the Byzantine Roman Empire and King Arthur in an attempt to build legitimacy for his new regime.|$|E
