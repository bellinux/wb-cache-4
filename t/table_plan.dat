In this paper, it also gives three typical examples of rebuilding equipment, <b>table</b> <b>planning</b> machine made in Germany, D 2300 lathe and 745 A slotter made in Russia.

Being a modest stadium with a capacity of 4,130, it would consist of a covered stand with 500 seats and two covered, terraced stands to hold 130 each (the capacity could be increased to 5,540 if tiered terraces are utilised). The proposal includes a full-size, all-weather and flood-lit artificial pitch, alongside three existing grass pitches. It would incorporate community facilities, in conjunction with the proposal of a new swimming pool. A full planning application was submitted to the City of Worcester Council and was accepted.|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{of several}} {{acceptance}} sampling procedures is performed and {{improvement of the}} procedures is sug- gested in this thesis. The issue of an efficient calculation of exact (P 1, P 2) single sampling plans for sampling by variables and exact LTPD and AOQL single sampling plans for sampling by variables when the rejected lots are inspected is addressed. The calculation of the plans is done using exact formula for operating characteristic of acceptance sampling plan and the new plans have better characteristics compared to the plans computed in a usual way using just approximately valid formula for operating characteristic. The <b>tables</b> of <b>plans</b> calculated according to procedures suggested in this thesis are provided {{for a couple of}} input parameters combinations. Tools designed for working with acceptance sampling plans, tools for analysis and calculation of acceptance sampling plans is one of the outputs of this thesis.

The tools are satisfactorily efficient and may be easily used even for acceptance sampling <b>plans</b> <b>tables</b> computation.

40|$|T-distributed {{stochastic}} neighbor embedding (tSNE) is {{a popular}} and prize-winning approach for dimensionality reduction and visualizing high-dimensional data. However, tSNE is non-parametric: once visualization is built, tSNE is not designed to incorporate additional data into existing representation. It highly limits the applicability of tSNE to the scenarios where data are added or updated over time (like dashboards or series of data snapshots). In this paper we propose, analyze and evaluate LION-tSNE (Local Interpolation with Outlier coNtrol) - a novel approach for incorporating new data into tSNE representation. LION-tSNE is based on local interpolation {{in the vicinity of}} training data, outlier detection and a special outlier mapping algorithm. We show that LION-tSNE method is robust both to outliers and to new samples from existing clusters. We also discuss multiple possible improvements for special cases. We compare LION-tSNE to a comprehensive list of possible benchmark approaches that include multiple interpolation techniques, gradient descent for new data, and neural network approximation.

40|$|While {{many aspects}} of the {{planning}} profession have changed radically in light of recent technological advances, the practice of sketching plans has remained largely unaffected. There may be good reasons for eschewing computers in the design arena such as that their use may detract from the liberty of the design thinking process. This thesis suggests that this reluctance may be overcome by changing the practice from one of emulation with digital tools to one of "augmentation". In addressing a perceived need to bring computation to the design table a solution called the "digitally augmented sketch planning environment" (DASPE) has been developed. Making use of video projection, DASPE augments the design space with digital visualization and analysis tools and allows planners to sketch using either conventional media or a pen stylus on a digitizing <b>table.</b> <b>Plans</b> can be sketched in the conventional manner, then "hardened" into three dimensional computer models without the need to leave the design space. by Kenneth Goulding.
