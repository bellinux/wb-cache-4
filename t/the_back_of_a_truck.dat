5|$|In {{accordance}} with normal repatriation procedures, Wilder-Neligan's commission in the AIF was terminated following {{his return to}} Australia in October 1919. He {{was involved in the}} formation of a soldiers' political party in Queensland, travelling the country and delivering speeches from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> On 1 January 1920 he was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the part-time army, the Citizens' Forces. In late March the following year he transferred to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, which was then occupying German New Guinea. This appointment was at the rank of lieutenant. He did not immediately travel to New Guinea, living on the north coast of Queensland for two months, and visiting Brisbane in early May to receive his French Croix de guerre from the former AIF commander Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood during the latter's first visit to Australia. Wilder-Neligan travelled to New Guinea later that year to take up his appointment.|$|E

25|$|A Property-Owner's Association was {{established}} in 1916. In addition to overseeing local services within the development, the organization also advocated that the community should become an independent municipality. Legislation {{was passed by the}} Legislature on March 22, 1917, and a referendum approving the establishment of the borough passed on April 12. On May 11, the borough's first council was elected, along with Joseph H. Senior, who was chosen by the voters as Beachwood's first mayor. A Board of Education was formed the following year, with school transportation provided on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> outfitted with wooden benches.|$|E

25|$|A {{turntable}} ladder (TL) {{is perhaps the}} best-known form of special purpose aerial apparatus, and is used {{to gain access to}} fires occurring at height using a large telescopic ladder, where conventional ladders carried on conventional appliances might not reach. The name is derived {{from the fact that the}} large ladder is mounted on a turntable on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> chassis, allowing it to pivot around a stable base. To increase its length, the ladder is telescopic. Modern telescopic ladders are either hydraulic or pneumatic. These mechanical features allow the use of ladders which are longer, sturdier, and more stable. They may also have pre-attached hoses or other equipment.|$|E
25|$|Born in Yerevan, Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union (now Armenia) on December 10, 1985 as Gevorg Petrosyan, he {{emigrated to}} Italy {{at the age}} of {{thirteen}} with his father, Andranik, and older brother, Stepan, arriving illegally in the country in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> They initially lived homeless in Milan, sleeping in train stations and on the streets, but were later taken in by a family in Gorizia who offered them work as night watchmen at their factory. After settling in Italy, he was soon joined by his mother, Karine, sister, Lianna, and younger brother, Armen, who is also a world champion kickboxer.|$|E
25|$|Silas is {{revealed}} {{to be working for}} an anonymous person named the Teacher, along with members of Opus Dei, led by Bishop Aringarosa. Evading the police, Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich, discovering a safe deposit box of Saunière's that is accessed using the Fibonacci sequence. Inside is a cryptex, a cylindrical container that hides a papyrus message which can only be accessed by spelling out a code word using dials. The police arrive and Langdon and Sophie are aided by the bank manager, Andre Vernet, only for him to take them hostage in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck,</b> and hold them at gunpoint demanding the cryptex. Langdon disarms Vernet and flees with Sophie and the cryptex.|$|E

25|$|This first Arājs {{action was}} later {{described}} by Georg Rosenstock, {{the commander of}} the second company of the 13th Police Reserve battalion. Rosenstock testified after the war that when he and his unit had arrived in Liepāja in July, 1941, they had heard from some passing marines that Jews were being continuously executed in the town, and these marines were going out to watch the executions. A few days later, on Saturday, July 24, 1941, Rosenstock saw Jews (whom he identified by the yellow stars on their clothing) crouching down in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck,</b> being guarded by armed Latvians. Rosenstock, who was himself in a vehicle, followed the truck {{to the north of the}} city to the beach near the naval base, where he saw Kügler, some SD men, and a number of Jews.|$|E
25|$|Although for the reactor's backup {{systems were}} available, the power loss proved {{that that was}} not the case for the spent fuel pools. No {{measures}} had been taken to prevent small animals entering this important equipment located at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> in open air. On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E
25|$|Kane then rekindled his {{feud with}} Edge, who, on the October 28 episode of SmackDown, {{was named the}} new {{challenger}} to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of SmackDown, Edge kidnapped Bearer and started to play mind games with Kane, trying to psychologically wear him down before their title match. At Survivor Series, Kane retained his title after the referee determined the match a draw due to both men pinning {{each other at the}} same time. As Edge still had Bearer in his captivity, Kane agreed to a rematch at the next pay-per-view. On December 3, Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match to win the right to determine the stipulation for the title match; Edge chose a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match before leaving Kane with a Paul Bearer lookalike and driving away with the genuine Bearer strapped to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> The following week, Kane accidentally injured Bearer, believing it to be another hoax by Edge, and Bearer was written out of the storyline. The week after, Kane rampaged into the stadium to hunt down Edge hoping to get back at him but the two were nearly restrained by the entire Smackdown roster.|$|E

500|$|The {{separation}} process {{was performed in}} a dedicated facility in the Bayo Canyon, in the radiochemistry building, designated TA-10-1.

500|$|On 1 October 2004, {{a central}} Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane {{in honour of}} the band.

500|$|For {{the scene}} in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the {{characters}} riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a saddle mounted on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> and act like they were riding horses. Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she had ever done, and was sure she [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve {{the effect of the}} passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses.

500|$|Seinfeld regular John O'Hurley had {{auditioned for}} several roles {{on the show}} but Carter had not {{previously}} {{thought of him as}} [...] "an X-Files actor". For the part of Dr. Pollidori, however, Carter considered him [...] "the absolute perfect casting choice". Stewart Gale, who played Izzy Berkowitz, was a non-actor who was sitting on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> when Carter passed. Carter convinced Gale's father—who was initially suspicious of the director's credentials—to let Gale travel to Vancouver {{to take part in the}} episode. The characters of Izzy's friends were also played by inexperienced actors. One was a snake handler on the set of The X-Files feature film—the shooting of which overlapped that of season five—and the other worked at a Vancouver coffee shop that Carter frequented.|$|E
500|$|The race {{marked the}} first Brazilian Grand Prix to be held {{since the death of}} three-time {{champion}} Ayrton Senna the previous year in a racing accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. [...] As such, various tributes were paid to him throughout the weekend, including a parade lap on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> with all the drivers waving Brazilian flags; a display from the Brazilian Air Force which resulted in a large [...] "S" [...] trail in the sky; and the renaming of a local highway to Rodovia Ayrton Senna. [...] The São Paulo city authorities had planned to rename the circuit after Senna, but the family of Carlos Pace, the existing dedicatee, objected. Barrichello also sported a special helmet design as a personal tribute to his compatriot. As a result of Senna's death, the event was lower-key than in recent years: fewer spectators turned out to watch practice and qualifying, but the race itself was watched by a capacity crowd.|$|E
500|$|Wallace Wilkinson {{was born}} {{on a farm in}} Casey County, Kentucky, about [...] {{southwest}} of the city of Liberty, on December 12, 1941. The son of Hershel and Cleo (Lay) Wilkinson, he had two older brothers and a younger sister. His parents were farmers and also operated a small general store. When Wilkinson was four years old, the family moved to Liberty, and the family opened Wilkinson's Grocery. During his childhood, he delivered newspapers, sold popcorn from a street stand, and co-owned a shoe shine parlor with a boyhood friend. He also accompanied his father to sell produce from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> It was during one such trip that he met Martha Carol Stafford, whose parents owned a grocery store about [...] away.
