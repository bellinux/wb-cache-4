60|$|Accordingly, {{the next}} morning, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast, Captain Sankey {{went out and}} called upon the doctor. Ned awaited his return anxiously.|$|E
60|$|LADY. I {{read them}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> I rode away on that poor lieutenant's horse. So you see I know what's in them; and you don't.|$|E
60|$|They {{arrived in}} town {{the next evening}} and called upon Lord Cochrane <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast next day. On Mr. Embleton sending in his name he was at once admitted.|$|E
60|$|Of course, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>after</b> each {{individual}} had ascertained his own losses, was to inquire into {{those of his}} neighbours, and the usual party in the ladies' cabin was seated around the sofa of Eve, about nine in the evening, conversing on this topic, after having held a short but serious discourse on their recent escape.|$|R
6000|$|... “Might as well,” {{answered}} Phil. “They’d strike for <b>the</b> hotel <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>after</b> a sea trip like that. Maybe {{they were}} both seasick.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{the boys}} from the {{settlement}} should get through by morning, and they're a straight crowd," [...] Joe said. [...] "We'll take <b>the</b> trail <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast." ...|$|R
60|$|I was scarce {{back on my}} rock (where I went always <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> I had eaten) before I {{observed}} a boat coming down the Sound, and with her head, as I thought, in my direction.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{there seemed}} no doubt now where the {{treasure}} lay, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast they started pulling down the ceiling. They got {{every inch of}} the ceiling down, and they took up the boards of the room above.|$|E
60|$|Out jumped Alured {{among all}} of us, and all the dogs at the garden gate; and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>after</b> his kiss to us all, was {{to turn to the}} fly and take out a flower-pot with a {{beautiful}} delicate forced rose in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{find your}} mother, baby darling, <b>the</b> very <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> I {{get out of}} this scrape; but there couldn't any one blame me for runnin' away when the perlice are after me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The monitor thread is {{a single}} {{independent}} process despite being named Monitor Thread. It is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> created <b>after</b> Listener when Tibero starts. It is the last process to finish when Tibero terminates. The monitor thread creates other processes when Tibero starts and checks each process status and deadlocks periodically.|$|R
50|$|Bedrossian's idol is {{basketball}} star Michael Jordan, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> Bedrossian did <b>after</b> arriving in Chicago was to find Jordan's house and take a photograph of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> the chores, Ans, is {{that woman}} over there. Of course it's out o' the {{question}} buryin' her, but we'd better go over an' git what things there is left o' the girl's, an' fasten up the shanty {{to keep the}} wolves out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall stay two {{or three}} days in town," [...] Major Mallett said. [...] "I must get an entire refit before I go down. You had better come round with me to the tailor's tomorrow, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast. You will want three or four suits, too." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{weather had}} set in very hot, {{and there was no}} {{stirring}} out now for the ladies between eleven o'clock and five or six in the afternoon. Isobel, however, generally went in for a chat, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> early breakfast, with Mrs. Doolan, whose children were fractious with prickly heat.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I did, <b>after</b> we {{were left}} {{together}} alone, {{was to make a}} third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|R
6000|$|He {{watched her}} in silence, pleased and curious to observe how {{beautiful}} a scene struck the childish {{eye of the}} little Londoner. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> she said, <b>after</b> three or four minutes' contemplation--a long time for such a child--was, 'Oh! I never saw anything so pretty!' then presently after, 'Oh! I wish little brother Felix was here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her eyes fell. [...] "No, {{not while}} he was on this life's plane. Indeed, it was my 'work' that--that {{separated}} us. He hated it and was very harsh about it. But <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he did <b>after</b> he passed on was to come back and tell me that I was right after all. He asked me to forgive him." ...|$|R
6000|$|On his {{way home}} he {{resolved}} to confess Kenby's presence; and he did {{so as soon as}} he sat down to supper with his wife. [...] "I ought to have told you <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast. But when I found you in that mood of having the place all to ourselves, I put it off." ...|$|E
60|$|There was but one resource. He {{would go}} and tell Irwine--tell him everything. The mere act of telling {{it would make it}} seem trivial; the temptation would vanish, as the charm of fond words vanishes when one repeats them to the indifferent. In every way it would help him to tell Irwine. He would ride to Broxton Rectory <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} then, {{providing}} {{the country has}} not in the meantime become too thickly settled, pay some small sum to the natives for the right of grazing your cattle on their unoccupied ground. They cultivate a mere fraction of the land. In this way you can keep vastly larger herds than your own ground could carry. However, {{it is time to}} be turning in for the night. To-morrow we will start <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast to inspect Langston's land." ...|$|E
60|$|The Indians have roots, {{which some}} of our gentlemen call sweet potatoes, which {{are by no means}} {{unpleasant}} to the taste, the only difficulty being that we cannot get any great quantity of them. Our master declares that when we make a garden, this root shall be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> planted, and <b>after</b> it has ripened, we will have some cooked every day.|$|R
6000|$|When one {{of these}} vines came {{up out of the}} earth, fresh from its seed, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> it wanted, <b>after</b> its tendrils began to show themselves, was {{something}} to climb up upon. It would like a good high pole. Now, if there was such a pole within a few feet of the little vine it would grow straight towards it, and climb up it! ...|$|R
6000|$|The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot, [...] Or hunt: the young, {{because they}} liked the sport-- [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> boys like <b>after</b> play and fruit; [...] The middle-aged to make the day more short; [...] For ennui is a growth of English root, [...] Though nameless in our language:--we retort [...] The fact for words, and let the French {{translate}} [...] That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> {{that which}} {{impressed}} itself on me with {{anything like the}} distinctness of reality {{was the sound of}} a crackling fire, accompanied with the sensation of warmth in my throat. Slowly opening my eyes I became {{aware of the fact that}} I was lying in front of a blazing fire, surrounded by Big Otter, Blondin, and Dougall, who stood gazing at me with anxious looks, while Henri Coppet knelt at my side, attempting to pour some warm tea down my throat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, he is king or more here! We met Markham at the farm; and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>after</b> {{looking at}} the cattle, Sir Guy found some planks lying about, {{and said they were}} the very thing for {{flooring}} the school. Markham mentioned some barn they were intended for, but Sir Guy said the school must be attended to at once, and went with us to look at it. That was what kept me so long, measuring and calculating; and I hope it may be begun in a week.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} Frank went over, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast, {{to see his}} friend the porter. He, too, was very pleased to hear of Frank's good fortune, {{but he was too}} busy to talk much to him, and promised that he would come over that evening and hear all about it. Then Frank took his way to Jermyn Street, and went with Mr. Goodenough to Silver's, where an outfit suited for the climate of Central Africa was ordered. The clothes were simple. Shirts made of thin soft flannel, knickerbockers and Norfolk jackets of tough New Zealand flax, with gaiters of the same material.|$|E
60|$|May 1st. On getting indoors last night, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I did, <b>after</b> {{striking}} a light, {{was to take}} the ragged cravat off the candles, and smooth it out on the table. I then took the end that had been in poor Mary's hand out of my writing-desk, and smoothed that out too. It matched the torn side of the cravat exactly. I put them together, and satisfied myself that there was not a doubt of it.|$|R
5000|$|Fernando Gago {{is also a}} {{literature}} and art enthusiast. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he did <b>after</b> landing in Spain was visit the Museo del Prado. He earned the nickname [...] "El Pintita" [...] (roughly meaning [...] "the little one trying to look good" [...] in English) ever since Ramón Maddoni scolded him for playing with his hair. Also, his Boca Juniors teammates would call him so because his youth squad coach would scold him [...] "stop trying to look good and run!" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{turns out}} Peyson and Fender is in cahoots together, since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> Peyson does <b>after</b> Joe leaves, is phone his accomplice. They also meet up the day after, just when Joe comes to see Fender {{as the next}} logical step in his investigation. Joe never sees Peyson, as he sneaks out through a back door. Joe gets very little {{information}} of use from Fender, but his visit makes Fender put one of his men, Pete, on tailing Joe to see if he finds out something.|$|R
6000|$|Julian {{went down}} to the door with Frank. [...] "Of course you will tell the general all about it, Frank. I suppose he knows {{something}} of the circumstances under which I went away, as he was a friend of our father's, and got you your commission, and takes such an interest in you. I daresay he will be shocked to hear that I have been carrying a French musket, but I am not ashamed of it myself, and consider that under the circumstances I was perfectly justified in doing so. Come round in the morning <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast. I have yet to learn all about how you found out that Markham committed that murder, and then you can tell me, too, what the general says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That I will {{certainly}} do. I will write to you after I {{have seen him}} and had a talk with Dorothy. There is the affair with Halliburn, which complicates the whole question confoundedly. I wish to goodness he would start {{for a trip to}} China and not come back until it is all over. It is lucky that that they have got a serious debate on to-night in the Upper House, and that he was, as he told us when he called this afternoon, unable to go to the Alberys; if it hadn't been so he would have been here by this time, to inquire what had occurred to make us send our excuses at the last moment. He will be round here <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast. Well, good night, Ned, if you must be going.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{hardly knew}} how to {{dissemble}} the feeling of humiliation mixed with indignation which flashed up in him, and which, he was afterwards afraid, must have made him seem rather curt in his response to the head waiter's civilities. Miss Axewright left the dining-room first, and he hurried out to look her up {{as soon as he}} had despatched the coffee and steak which formed his breakfast, with a wholly unreasoned impulse to offer her some sort of reparation for the slight the conditions put upon her. He found her sitting on the veranda beside the friendly tabby of his last night's acquaintance, and far, apparently, from feeling the need of reparation through him. She was very nice, though, and after chatting a little while she rose, and excused herself to the tabby, with a politeness that included Gaites, upon the ground of a promise to Miss Desmond that she would come up, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>after</b> breakfast, and see how the piano was getting along.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he did <b>after</b> {{this was}} to send for the son he had by me from the university. He came the week afterwards, and the tutor with him, {{to take care of}} his pupil. The next day after my lord came home, and sending for six eminent men that lived at The Hague he made his will, and signed it in the {{presence}} of them all; and they, with the chaplain, were appointed the executors of it, and guardians of my son.|$|R
6000|$|... "After a while I {{began to}} feel sleepy. I don't {{remember}} going to sleep, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I knew <b>after</b> I {{began to feel}} sleepy was that I was waking up. We were stopping to change horses. We stopped to change horses very often--oftener than once an hour. When we changed horses we always changed the postilion too. A new postilion always came with every new team. It was only the conductor {{that we did not}} change. He went with us all the way.|$|R
500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> [...] tried <b>after</b> {{acquiring}} Bungie, {{after first}} attempting to fully assimilate them, {{was to move}} Bungie into a standard Microsoft building {{with the rest of}} the game group. [...] But unlike the rest of the teams they'd brought in previously, Bungie didn't move into Microsoft corporate offices – we tore all of the walls out of that section of the building and sat in a big open environment. Luckily Alex and Jason [...] were pretty steadfast at the time about staying somewhat separate and isolated.|$|R
