5|$|The {{ships of}} the class served in various units in the German fleet, {{including}} on the America Station, in the East Asia Squadron, and with the home fleet. Hertha and Hansa participated in {{the suppression of the}} Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, and Vineta was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903. All five ships were modernized between 1905 and 1911, after which <b>they</b> <b>served</b> as training ships for naval cadets. They were mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but were quickly withdrawn from front-line service. <b>They</b> <b>served</b> in various secondary roles {{for the rest of the}} war.

5|$|Although The Marble Index {{was largely}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it has {{achieved}} acclaim from music critics over time. Nico's unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, <b>they</b> <b>served</b> as a musical and visual prototype for the 1980s post-punk movement's gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974)—which are now considered parts of a trilogy.|$|E

5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times. Four cars were {{successfully}} overhauled for improved operation in 1974, but the rebuilding cost more than the original purchase price of the cars. Thirty-three more cars were overhauled in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; <b>they</b> <b>served</b> until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, both Mississippi-class {{ships were}} sold to Greece; {{this was the only}} sale of {{functional}} US battleships to a foreign government. From 1914 to the early 1930s, the ships were active in the Greek Navy, serving mostly in coastal defense and attack roles. In these missions and in the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, their limitations were less pronounced. <b>They</b> <b>served</b> in the Russian Civil War and the Greco-Turkish War. By the mid-1930s, they were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles, and Idahos guns were removed to coastal fortifications. Both were sunk by German aircraft in 1941, and raised in the 1950s to be sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where <b>they</b> <b>served</b> sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what the {{function}} of the oral setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that <b>they</b> <b>served</b> as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
