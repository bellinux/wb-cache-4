40|$|Three {{dimensional}} Finite Element {{model is}} used to investigate the loosening behavior of countersunk threaded fasteners subjected to cyclic shear loading applied through prescribed transverse excitation to the fastener head. Fasteners with conical head profile require precision machining of both the fastener head and the mating joint hole. Any mismatch between the head and the joint conical angles affects the torque tension relationship {{as well as the}} loosening performance. Investigation focuses on the loosening behavior in its early stages. Factors investigated include the effect of the bolt head/joint hole contact location, joint elastic modulus, and tapped hole clearance for different combinations of <b>thread</b> <b>fit,</b> on the loosening performance of preloaded countersunk-head bolts. The FEA model prediction of the self-loosening behavior is experimentally validated...|$|E

The minimum limits for external (or bolt, in ISO terminology), and the maximum limits for internal (nut), thread sizes are there to ensure that threads do not strip at the tensile strength limits for the parent material.

50|$|Before {{fitting the}} valve the thread type must be checked {{to ensure that}} a valve with {{matching}} <b>thread</b> specification is <b>fitted.</b> Fitting of valves should follow the procedures specified in ISO 13341 Transportable gas cylinders - Fitting of valves to gas cylinders.|$|R
50|$|A {{ball joint}} {{consists}} of a bearing stud and socket enclosed in a casing; all these parts are made of steel. The bearing stud is tapered and <b>threaded,</b> and <b>fits</b> into a tapered hole in the steering knuckle. A protective encasing prevents dirt from getting into the joint assembly. Usually, this is a rubber-like boot that allows movement and expansion of lubricant. Motion-control ball joints tend to be retained with an internal spring, which helps to prevent vibration problems in the linkage.|$|R
50|$|The MGP-15 is a submachine gun {{designed}} for issue to special forces made by SIMA-CEFAR, updated with a longer barrel and other features.

50|$|The screws {{used in the}} Flexowriter were unique, having large flat {{heads with}} a very narrow {{screwdriver}} slot and a unique thread size and pitch. This {{may have been a}} conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC <b>threads</b> appear to <b>fit</b> some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.|$|R
5000|$|In nasopharyngeal {{cannulation}} (or {{placement of}} the nasopharyngeal airway or tube), the infant is fitted with a blunt-tipped length of surgical tubing (or an endotracheal tube fitted to the child), which is placed under direct visualization with a laryngoscope, being inserted into the nose and down the pharynx (or throat), ending just above the vocal cords. Surgical <b>threads</b> <b>fitted</b> through holes in the outside end of the tube {{are attached to the}} cheek with a special skin-like adhesive material called 'stomahesive', which is also wrapped around the outside end of the tube (but not over the opening at the end) to keep the tube in place. This tube or cannula, which itself acts as an airway, primarily acts as a sort of [...] "splint" [...] which maintains patency of the airway by keeping the tongue form falling back on the posterior pharyngeal wall and occluding the airway, therefore preventing airway obstruction, hypoxia and asphyxia. Nasopharyngeal airways are not available at every center, however, when available, nasopharyngeal cannulation should be favored over the other treatments mentioned in this article, as it is far less invasive; it allows the infant to feed without the further placement of a nasogastric tube. This treatment may be utilized for multiple months, until the jaw has grown enough so that the tongue assumes a more normal position in the mouth and airway (at birth, the jaws of some infants are so underdeveloped that only the tip of the tongue can be seen when viewed in the throat). Some institutions discharge the infant home with a nasopharyngeal tube in place (Citation: KD Anderson, May 2007, CPCJ).|$|R

50|$|Initially the {{missiles}} were simply cut down arrows or crossbow bolts. The first purpose made darts were manufactured {{in one piece}} from wood; wrapped with a strip of lead for weight and fitted with flights made from split turkey feathers. These darts were mainly imported from France and became known as French darts. Metal barrels were patented in 1906 but wood continued to be used into the 1950s.The first metal barrels were made from brass which was relatively cheap and easy to work. The wooden shafts, which were now <b>threaded</b> to <b>fit</b> the tapped barrel, were either fletched as before or designed to take a paper flight. This type of dart continued to be used into the 1970s. When the advantages of using plastic were realised, the shaft and flight became separate entities, although one piece moulded plastic shaft and flights were also available.|$|R
5000|$|Beads for {{barbells}} {{can vary}} widely {{in design and}} appearance, although {{the vast majority of}} beads are simply spherical in design. That being said, any shape that threads can be tapped into {{can be used as a}} bead. Cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones, disks, and other basic shapes are common alternative bead designs. Some large gauge barbells, especially those used in tongue piercings, use [...] "smartie beads", flattened circular beads, to prevent the jewelry from damaging the gums and teeth and allowing free movement of the tongue. There also exist [...] "bondage" [...] beads, which are dimpled to accept a captive bead ring, or the [...] "koosh" [...] bead which is a bead made of a rubbery material textured like a French tickler <b>threaded</b> to <b>fit</b> the tip of a barbell. Miniature vibrators also exist, in a variety of hard or soft materials on the exterior of the bead.|$|R

5000|$|The term fine {{adjustment}} screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra {{fine adjustment}} screw {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO metric screw thread designations and UNC designations have been used to call out <b>thread</b> dimensions and <b>fit</b> (class). A typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. [...] Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.|$|R
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching <b>thread</b> specification is <b>fitted.</b>|$|R
40|$|Atomicity is used widely {{for expressing}} interference-freedom {{requirements}} between code blocks in executions of concurrent programs. In this study, we propose a new notion of atomicity called “rollback atomicity”. Commonly used definitions of atomicity have the following form: A concurrent execution σ conc {{of a program}} is atomic iff there exists an equivalent, serialized execution σ ser in which every atomic block by thread t is executed with no interruption by actions of other <b>threads.</b> Rollback atomicity <b>fits</b> into this template as well. In rollback atomicity, we require {{a particular kind of}} match between the states of σ conc and the witness execution σ ser at certain points in each execution approximately corresponding to completion points of atomic blocks.

40|$|On 20 August 2010 an {{energetic}} disturbance triggered damped large-amplitude longitudinal (LAL) oscillations in almost an entire filament. In the present work we analyze this periodic {{motion in the}} filament to characterize the damping and restoring mechanism of the oscillation. Our method involves placing slits along the axis of the filament at different angles {{with respect to the}} spine of the filament, finding the angle at which the oscillation is clearest, and fitting the resulting oscillation pattern to decaying sinusoidal and Bessel functions. These functions represent the equations of motion of a pendulum damped by mass accretion. With this method we determine the period and the decaying time of the oscillation. Our preliminary results support the theory presented by Luna and Karpen (2012) that the restoring force of LAL oscillations is solar gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Following an earlier paper, we have determined the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic flux tubes hosting a thread along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate of the filament <b>threads,</b> via the <b>fitted</b> parameters.

40|$|Strong Floors are {{essential}} for performing quasi-static cyclic experiments testing full-scale members under extreme amounts of force. They allow the force to dissipate without causing differential settlement and/or cracking failures {{to the floor and}} building. With threaded anchors, spaced 18 inches on center, custom actuators and steel reaction frames will bolt securely to the 875. 5 square foot floor for testing. To get the desired floor complete and ready for research testing, a previous lab was removed to clear floor space. Then multiple companies were organized to come scan and cut the existing concrete floor to the mapped layout. The concrete was taken out by a jackhammer and skid-steer with an addition of excavated soil to get to a desired depth of two feet. Reinforcing bar was delivered and then caged into the hole with four inch spacing where <b>threaded</b> anchors will <b>fit</b> to be flush with the top of the floor.

40|$|At first glance, the This month’s {{tutorial}} is an {{construction of}} overview of RF/microwave RF/microwave connector specifications for materials and dimensional manufacturing tolerances, intended to familiarize engineers with important non-electrical parameters connectors seems quite straightforward. Physical dimensions are dictated {{largely by the}} desired combination of RF characteristics—characteristic impedance, power handling (current capacity and voltage breakdown), and compatibility with typical cables. The choice of body metal, plating, and dielectric material will depend on environmental requirements—water, corrosion, temperature, air pressure (altitude), mating-unmating cycles, shock and vibration. Of course, construction must be compatible with interface standards for the mating methods: <b>threaded,</b> bayonet, friction <b>fit,</b> etc. For non-critical, general-purpose use, the specifications might stop at this point, {{but there are many}} additional requirements and refinements to basic specs that must be considered for specific applications. Example: MIL-STD- 348 B Type N Connector The most comprehensive set of mechanical specifications for RF/microwave connectors is MIL-STD- 348 B [1]. I’ve chosen the common “series N ” connector to illustrate the requirements called out in this important document. Refer to the outline drawings in Figure 1 and the list of dimensions in Table 1.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{high-performance}} {{transaction processing}} applications increasingly run on multisocket multicore servers. Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory access latency {{as well as}} non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately, traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-core communication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path. While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4 processors, it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses to centralized data structures. In this paper, we propose ATraPos, a storage manager design that {{is aware of the}} non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achieves good data locality by carefully par-titioning the data as well as internal data structures (e. g., state information) to the available processors and by assigning threads to specific partitions. Furthermore, ATraPos dynamically adapts to the workload characteristics, i. e., when the workload changes, ATraPos detects the change and automatically revises the data partitioning and <b>thread</b> placement to <b>fit</b> the current access patterns and hardware topology. We prototype ATraPos on top of an open-source storage manager Shore-MT and we present a detailed experimental analysis with both synthetic and standard (TPC-C and TATP) benchmarks. We show that ATraPos exhibits performance im-provements of a factor ranging from 1. 4 to 6. 7 x for a wide collection of transactional workloads. In addition, we show that the adaptive monitoring and partitioning scheme of ATraPos poses a negligible cost, while it allows the system to dynamically and gracefully adapt when the workload changes.
