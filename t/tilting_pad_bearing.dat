Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, {{just two years}} after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold's equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular - the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone {{as a result of}} fitting Michell's tilting-pad bearings.|$|E

Also the bearing needs to be designed in order to be suited for the rotor-bearing system and operating condition. In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five pad <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and pivot offset. In this context, rotor dynamic analysis of the 5 MW industrial gas turbine supported by the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> at the front and roller bearing at the rear is carried out based on the dynamic coefficients of the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> investigated. The result shows that two rigid body critical modes experience various changes according to the influence of the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> uniquely applied to one side of this machine. Mainly, the second critical speed, the rigid body mode of conical shape with high whirling in the <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing,</b> is significantly changed by preload and pivot offset regardless of the LBP and LOP configurations. And the first critical mode, the rigid body mode of conical shape with high whirling in the roller bearing, is sensitively affected by preload applied to the LOP configuration and by its asymmetric dynamic properties...|$|E

40|$|LectureTilting pad {{bearings}} {{are used}} extensively in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting pad bearings are used for oil lubricated bearings. Babbitted tilting pad bearings are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting pad journal bearing and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a {{tilting pad thrust bearing}} while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is the elimination of the bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing, the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting pad thrust bearing have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|E

40|$|Tilting–pad journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) {{are widely used}} in rotating machinery to support the rotors efficiently at elevated speeds under light/heavy loadings. Because of the importance of this machine component, many authors have published several theoretical and experimental studies, to evaluate the influence of clearance, lubricant temperature, oil flow-rate and thermal effects on behavior of TPJB. However, the investigations of the influence of loading direction on properties of TPJB are very limited. In bearing models as well as in experimental tests, the load is often assumed along the vertical direction only and the geometry of the bearing is the same for each pad, which corresponds to an axial symmetry of the bearing. This paper presents first a theoretical analysis of the influence of the load direction on both the static and the dynamic behavior of a five-pad TPJB with a non-uniform clearance: that is, the different bearing configurations in the range between load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pads (LBP) are investigated. Then, the analytical results are compared with experimental measurements. The tests were performed with a nominal diameter of 100 mm and a length– to–diameter ratio of 0. 7, using a suitable test-rig, in which it is possible to apply the static load in any direction. The procedure for the estimation of the bearing geometry from experimental measurement of the non-uniform clearance profile is also described. The results show that the load direction has considerable effects on both the static and the dynamic characteristics of the TPJB.

Two 4000 hp through-drive electric motors were totally destroyed when the inboard coupling failed. Market conditions dictated that the compressor {{be put back}} into service as expeditiously as possible. A 3600 rpm prototype 8000 hp motor which could be fitted on the existing foundation was acquired from a power company. The existing half shell journal bearings had to be converted to a full shell design in order to solve a vibration problem. After start-up, the motor was plagued with a random vibration problem which occurred during a load change. Vibration data taken during one of these excursions indicated sub-synchronous frequencies at halfspeed, which were equal in amplitude to the horizontal readings at synchronous speed. A computer model simulating the rotor and bearing systems indicated a whirl instability problem at 1800 rpm.

40|$|LectureThe {{amount of}} damping in the rotor/bearing {{system is the}} key to {{stability}} of centrifugal gas compressors, especially for rotors with high slenderness ratio. A full pressure performance test can certainly demonstrate whether a rotor is stable or not. But the drawback is that it cannot quantify the amount of damping in the system prior to the instability threshold. Alternatively, the rotor can be subjected to disturbances by applying a force acting on the rotor and the response from the rotor allows us to measure the amount of damping through vibration amplitude changes. In this paper, we will discuss a magnetic exciter system that was designed to inject a known force {{at one end of the}} rotor while the rotor is operating at different loaded conditions. The compressor rotor was excited by magnetic forces and its response was observed for evaluating the damping of the system. Different techniques were used to estimate rotor stability and were evaluated in this study. This test arrangement can also be used to evaluate different journal bearing designs. Data from a centrifugal compressor test using three different tilting pad bearings are compared and discussed.

40|$|Case StudyThis {{case history}} {{discusses}} the upgrade of the # 1 combination journal-thrust bearing assembly {{in the front}} standard of a 75 MW turbine/generator set. The existing taper land thrust plates experienced frequent failures and the sleeve journal bearing was wearing prematurely. A combination journal-thrust assembly was designed and installed in the front standard of the turbine. This assembly incorporated fully equalized ball & socket <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> with directed lubrication and a ball & socket <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearing.</b> The spherical support fit {{was replaced by a}} cylindrical support fit. The ring saddle supporting the journal housing was redesigned to be bolted to the thrust housing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{response}} of the compliant <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearings</b> subjected to synchronous excitation. Bearing compliance {{is affected by the}} properties of pad liner and pad support geometry. Different unbalance eccentricities are considered. It is shown that bearing dynamic response is non-linear. Journal orbit complexity increases with pad compliance though the orbit amplitudes are marginally affected at low loads. At high loads, the journal is forced to operate outside the bearing clearance. The polymer liner reduces the maximum oil film pressure by a factor of 2 when compared to the white metal liner. The nonlinear dynamic response of compliant <b>tilting</b> <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearings</b> is thoroughly discussed...|$|R
