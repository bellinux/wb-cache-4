Our discussion of these brochure representations will examine the contrasts between tourism advertising imagery and the day-to-day interactions of tourists and locals in the islands represented. Informed by literature on motives for travel, <b>tourist</b> <b>brochures,</b> place promotion and commodification, we will discuss how German, Swiss and Austrian tourism operators depend on a deep-seated desire on the part of tourists to engage with a mythical paradisal Utopia. Common to many cultures, Utopia represents dreams of a better reality. We emphasise therefore that in addition to the now well-documented paradisal element of island tourism promotion, German-speaking tourists are enticed to the South Pacific by advertising references to it as a place where dreams may be fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{translation}} of wordplays and cultural words in a German <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> into Swedish. The overall aim was to examine which strategies were used to translate them and how the skopos, i. e. the purpose, and the text type affected these choices. Translating wordplays {{is known to be}} notoriously difficult, and this is also brought to light in this thesis. Even though 55 % of the wordplays could be translated into a wordplay, 32 % could not. In a few cases the strategy wordplay à related rhetorical device (for example rhyme, metaphor or irony) was used in order to retain the vocative purpose of the wordplay. A stronger way to ensure and preserve the vocative function in the target text was by using the strategy non wordplay à wordplay, a so-called compensatory strategy – a strategy sometimes deemed necessary. Cultural words are concepts that demand a certain amount of knowledge of the reader. The aim was to examine if these concepts, such as material culture (for example food and towns) and ecology, should be translated by source-text oriented, or rather by target-text oriented translation strategies. The results show that both strategies are indispensable in order to fulfil the skopos of a <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure.</b> However, the target-text oriented strategies, such as generalization and substitution, dominated with 52 %. The source-text oriented strategies were used in only 38 % of the cases. In some cases the cultural word was translated by an official equivalent, i. e. neither a source- nor target-text oriented strategy...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of an {{interest}} in the communicative and rhetorical powers of the written word and the picture. Separately, these modalities are able to convey meaningful messages; combined, their messages can be reinforced. The thesis aims to explore how the modalities are used in a Norwegian <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> about Fjord Norway and a Scottish <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> about the Highlands {{in order to create a}} distinctive and an attractive text. The empirical material is studied from both a social semiotic and a rhetorical perspective. The analytical tools applied in this thesis are Michael Halliday’s metafunctions, the textual, the interpersonal and the ideational, as described in Halliday & Matthiessen (2004), Maagerø (1998, 2005) and Kress & van Leeuwen (2006). The metafunctions are used mainly to describe how meaning is conveyed by the arrangement of elements on the page, the engagement between the author and the reader and the representation of a visual journey through the tourist destinations. The findings show that the written word and the picture interact differently in the two brochures. In the Norwegian brochure the modalities play together in order to convey a specific feeling which a journey to Fjord Norway will create. In contrast, in the Scottish brochure the modalities are used to introduce the reader to several attractions and suggestions for holiday activities. In order to explain the brochures’ different strategies properly, this thesis also introduces a new category referred to as enticing/alluring (“lokkende/forførende”). The main purpose of this category is to describe the function of pictures in tourist brochures. However, it also serves in this thesis as a means to describe the overall function of the two brochures...|$|E

Ihey contrast with the common <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> concept of oceanic islands. As the Antarctic Plate is virtually static, the islands seldom show signs of association with long-lived linear island chains and most thus stand alone. Longer-lived islands are either on submarine plateaux or are continental remnants of the dispersion of Gondwana. The islands are classified in relation to raised sea-floor, transform fault, triple junction, subduction zone, submarine plateau, submerged continent or continental. Many are difficult of access and poorly known geologically. Their geological history controls their many other roles such as sites as observatories, or for study of colonisation, evolution and speciation rates...|$|E

The popularity of Lake Constance {{as a tourist}} destination owes much to its beautiful natural landscape, which is often depicted in romantic images and words in the tourist brochures and guidebooks from the region.

The paper reflects on the ways in which Walser's ?anti-tourist? characters react to, and are influenced by, the natural landscape and the holiday destination. It focuses on the satirical use of typical <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> and guidebook descriptions of the landscape, {{and the ways in which}} changes in the landscape mirror changes in the destructive relationship between the four characters.

Salomé Voegelin produced 'The Arrangement' to be listened to walking into the town centre from Loughborough train station. "This is a sonic document, the only document I have left, of a brief visit to Loughborough that casts doubt on whether the town actually exists as a solid architectural fact, however firmly it is established on a map, or evidenced in a photographic <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure.</b> You make an arrangement, book a ticket and depart, but as you arrive and walk through its streets it becomes clearer and clearer {{that it is not}} there, you are there.

But it lacks the assumed opacity of its own architecture, its buildings, its sights, in favour of life living now, dense, porous and complex and there. The buildings seen are but façades, pretending a permanence that is contradicted by the sounds of the town, talking and moving; proclaiming a far more ephemeral presence. The town itself is transitory, passing the trains arriving at its station, rather than the trains passing it. Loughborough in the end becomes the visit rather than Loughborough the town, because Loughborough itself, as shown on the map, does not exist in sound. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] This paper aims to {{show how}} the Genre and Multimodality (GeM) model (Bateman 2008) {{can be applied to the}} study of {{multimodal}} meaning-making and genre as higher level organizational concept in print media. The theoretical framework of the GeM model combines the methodologies of corpus and text linguistics and document design in a multi-layered and cross-referenced XML-based annotation schema, which is suited for the systematical analysis required in modelling the complex phenomenon of genre in print media. An analysis of a series of five tourist brochures published between 1967 and 1988 for the purpose of advertising the city of Helsinki serves as the basis for a discussion of the patterns that may be identified in the rhetorical, layout and navigational structures in this particular print media genre. The semiotic resources of language and image convey ideational meaning for the purpose of construing a persuasive image of the locations, and to guide the reader to and around the location. Consistent patterns in layout and realisation information (typographical and visual features) are used to make the document accessible to the reader. The findings imply that while identifying patterns that may be attributed to the genre of <b>tourist</b> <b>brochure</b> is possible, many of the features can also exist in other print media genres, which suggest that the concept of genre itself is fuzzy and may contain overlapping features. A prototypical model of genre provides a context for more detailed studies of multimodal semiotics, but further investigations and comparative studies are required to in order to work towards a functioning definition genre in print media...|$|E
