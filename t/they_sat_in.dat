5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel in the same class as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the stores for two hours and then left without incident.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{struggled}} to a 4–7–2 record in November, losing six {{of their last}} seven road games during the month. However, the team ended the month with its star players playing their best games of the season. Kiprusoff recorded his third shutout {{of the season in}} a 3–0 win against the Minnesota Wild while Iginla scored eight goals and 12 points in the final nine games of the month. Though <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> 14th place in the 15-team Western Conference, the Flames ended November only five points out of a playoff spot. The organization reached a milestone during the month, as Curtis Glencross scored the 10,000th goal {{in the history of the}} Flames franchise during a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on November 26.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking her}} to dinner on December 10, Kosova said Acremant pulled out a gun and a stun gun as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> her truck and {{told her he had}} killed three people; two just that week. He {{unscrewed}} the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside.|$|E
25|$|Services of {{that era}} were austere and lengthy, {{conducted}} in strict accordance with Calvinist beliefs. On the Sabbath day, liquor consumption, discharge of firearms and beating of drums were forbidden, with steadily escalating penalties starting at one Flemish pound. The church itself was unheated, due to fears of fire. Some congregants brought small stoves to warm their feet in winter. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> seats {{on either side of}} the sanctuary. A Vorleser (reader) and Vorsanger (music leader) assisted the minister. There were no books for the audience since many were illiterate. The church did not have an organ since they were considered a work of the devil.|$|E

25|$|According to Ağca, {{the plan}} was for him and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire in St. Peter's Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy {{under the cover of}} the panic {{generated}} by a small explosion. On 13 May <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, Ağca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin and prevented from finishing the assassination or escaping. Four bullets hit John Paul II, two of them lodging in his lower intestine, the others hitting his left hand and right arm. Two bystanders were also hit. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the square, writing postcards {{waiting for}} the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed through an adoring and excited crowd of supporters, Ağca fired four shots at 17:17 with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power {{semi-automatic}} pistol, and critically wounded him. He fled the scene as the crowd was in shock and disposed of the pistol by throwing it under a truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. All four bullets hit John Paul II; two of them lodged in his lower intestine while the other two hit his left index finger and right arm and also injured two bystanders: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall was slightly wounded in the arm. The Pope was immediately {{rushed to the hospital}} while the authorities combed the site for evidence. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire.|$|E

500|$|After {{speaking}} with Lotshe and Thompson, {{the king was}} still hesitant to make a decision.

To prevent the wasting of paper, concept art, location stills and costume tests were posted on a website created by the production for crew members to reference. Costumes were kept for future Fox productions or given to homeless shelters, rather than thrown away. Hybrid vehicles were used and crew members had orders to turn off their car engines if <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> their vehicles for more than three minutes.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara first {{attended}} the John Street West Girls' School near Thomas Street in Dublin's Liberties Area.

From that age she trained in drama, music and dance along with her siblings at the Ena Mary Burke School of Drama and Elocution in Dublin.

500|$|Alberta had {{implemented}} prohibition in 1916 as {{the result}} of a referendum supported by the powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) lobby group. [...] By the time Stewart took office, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not being universally complied with: Conservative MLA George Douglas Stanley alleged that judges were often hungover when <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> judgment of those accused of violating liquor laws, and Cross's replacement as Attorney-General, John Boyle, admitted that in his estimation 65% of the province's male population broke the Prohibition Act. [...] In 1921 the government realized profits of $800,000 on alcohol legally sold for [...] "medicinal" [...] purposes, and Boyle estimated bootleggers' profits at nine times that figure. [...] Stewart blamed the problems on insufficient public support for the law, but even as he did so it was clear that there was not enough support to repeal it.|$|E
