5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected life span of a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a live outside broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.|$|E

5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century {{and led to a}} surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, {{mostly because of}} electronics-related {{applications}} that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium crucibles are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the chloralkali process (1.1 t in 2007) and chemical catalysts (0.75 t in 2007).|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{permeability}} {{primarily affects}} transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E

5|$|With <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{the number}} of {{batteries}} of heavier guns, the armies needed to find a more efficient method of moving the heavier guns around. (It was proving difficult to find {{the number of}} draught horses required.) The War office ordered over 1,000 Holts caterpillar tractors, which transformed the mobility of the siege artillery. The army also mounted a variety of surplus naval guns on various railway platforms to provide mobile long-range heavy artillery on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the {{domestic}} manufacturing industry {{there was still}} a significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a smooth transition period.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that {{of the rest of the}} nation but was biased towards the middle classes, transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, , had a focus on responding to China's rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> spending did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF's size and capabilities.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> {{population}} {{caused many}} adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and the waiting list for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E
