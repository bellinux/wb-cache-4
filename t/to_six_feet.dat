The spent fuel pools at Indian Point are not stored under a {{containment}} dome like the reactor, but rather they are contained within an indoor 40-foot-deep pool and submerged under 27 feet of water. Water {{is a natural}} and effective barrier to radiation. The spent fuel pools at Indian Point are set in bedrock and are constructed of concrete walls that are four <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> wide, with a quarter-inch thick stainless steel inner liner. The pools each have multiple redundant backup cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|The Tripuris live on {{the slopes}} of hills in a group of five to fifty families. Their houses in these areas are built of bamboo or ua as it is called in Kokborok and raised five <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> height to save {{themselves}} from the dangers of the wild animals. Nowadays a considerable section of this community are living in the plains and erecting houses like the plains people, adopting their methods of cultivation, and following them in other aspects of life, such as dress, manners, and cosmetics. Tripuri women wear a scarp, called rignai, which reaches down just below the knee. They weave in their loin-loom a small piece of cloth, which they call risa, and they use this small piece of cloth as their breast garment.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{initially}} {{estimated that}} the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million cubic yards (4 millionm³) on December 25, 2008. The spill covered surrounding land with up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> (1.8 m) of sludge. The EPA first {{estimated that the}} spill would take {{four to six weeks}} to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% of the spill had been cleaned and is now estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA.|$|E

25|$|The {{finished}} canal ran 108 miles (174km), from Honesdale to Kingston (counting the tidewater {{portions of}} the Rondout where the canal joined the creek at Eddyville). Its 108 locks took it over elevation changes totaling 1,075 feet (328 m), more than the Erie Canal's 675 feet (206 m). The channel was four feet (122cm) deep (eventually increased <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> (2 m)) by 32 feet (10 m) wide. It was crossed by 137 bridges and had 26 dams, basins and reservoirs. Originally it crossed the four rivers along its course — the Lackawaxen, Delaware, Neversink and Rondout Creek — via slackwater dams. Aqueducts were built over the rivers to replace them by John Roebling in the 1840s, cutting a few days from canal travel time and reducing accidents that were occurring at the Delaware crossing with loggers rafting their harvest downstream.|$|E
25|$|Standing five feet, nine {{inches tall}} as a 15-year-old, Colborne played {{a season of}} midget hockey with the Notre Dame Hounds in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, before being {{recruited}} by the Camrose Kodiaks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He played two seasons in Camrose between 2006 and 2008 and scored 53 goals and 138 points in 108 games. The Kodiaks won the AJHL championship both seasons and reached the Royal Bank Cup national championship each year; they lost the semi-final in 2007 and the final in 2008. Colborne was named the Canadian Junior A Hockey League Player of the Year in 2007–08 following a 33-goal, 90-point season with Camrose. Having grown <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet,</b> five inches tall {{by the time he}} was 18, Colborne was selected in the first round, 16th overall, by the Boston Bruins at the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. In doing so, he became only the second first round selection in the AJHL's history, following Brent Sutter (17th overall in 1980). Colborne also committed to play college hockey for the University of Denver Pioneers.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from sleep mode.|$|E

500|$|After VII Corps {{took the}} port city of Cherbourg, VIII Corps began moving south against German forces {{in the middle of the}} Cotentin Peninsula. The Germans had the high ground, and the {{fighting}} was further complicated by the bocage countryside—a series of farmers fields and pastures forming a latticework, with each unit separated by walls of earth up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> high supporting dense shrubbery and trees. [...] The German defenders had every advantage over the Americans, whose tanks would tip up and expose their thin bottom armor as they attempted to cross the barriers. [...] By mid July, field expedient devices were developed to equip tanks to penetrate the hedgerows and restore battlefield mobility. [...] Such specially equipped tanks were referred to as Rhino Tank.|$|E
500|$|Ali's longstanding finale was the {{swallowing}} of copious {{amounts of}} water again, but this time followed by a pint of kerosene. A prop was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table, within which a small flame burned. Lighter than water and immiscible with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first. The stage thus set, and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells, Ali became a [...] "human flamethrower", spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop, setting it ablaze. Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> away, extinguishing the fire.|$|E

2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} 21 hexagonal white marble pillars ranging in height from one <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet,</b> each bearing {{the name of}} one of the victims. It was designed by Roberto Valdes, a former student at Southwestern College, who said of the sculpture: [...] "The 21 hexagons represent each person that died, and they are different heights, representing the variety of ages and races of the people involved in the massacre. They are bonded together in the hopes that the community, in a tragedy like this, will stick together, like they did." [...] Every anniversary, the monument is decorated with flowers. On the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead, November 1, candles and offerings are brought on behalf of the victims. The monument is at 460 West San Ysidro Boulevard.|$|E

2500|$|Access to {{the body}} can limit which insects can get {{to the body}} in order to feed and lay eggs. [...] Those {{circumstances}} that enhance the availability of corpses for arthropod colonization are called [...] "physical barriers". For example, corpses found in brightly lit areas are generally inhabited by Lucilia illustris, in contrast to Phormia regina, which prefers more shaded areas. Darkness, cold, and rain limit the amount of insects that would otherwise colonize the body. A submerged corpse can vary in temperature and is colonized by very few terrestrial insects. Fish, crustaceans, aquatic insects [...] and bacteria would be the likely fauna in this case. Bodies that have been buried are harder to get to than freely available bodies which limits the availability of certain insects to colonize.

2500|$|The Corwin {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} Pacific and Arctic oceans; her home port {{throughout}} her government service was San Francisco. [...] She made her first trip to northern waters in 1877 under Captain J.W. White. In 1880 and 1881 [...] with Calvin L. Hooper commanding and Michael Healy as Executive Officer, she searched in the Arctic for the USS Jeannette, a lost exploration vessel, and two lost whalers, Vigilant and Mount Wollaston. For this expedition, she was sheathed with one-inch oak planks from two feet above the water line <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> below, with the oak applied over the copper and secured with 2.5inch composition nails [...] [...] Also added was an ice-breaking attachment for her bow, constructed of 3/8inch iron plate, which could {{be put in place}} when needed. Captain Hooper sent out exploratory parties by dogsled along the Siberian arctic coast. Artifacts and stories collected from the Chukchi residents of the coast confirmed that the Vigilant had been lost with no survivors, and apparently had picked up survivors from the Mount Wollaston before her own disaster. [...] In the course of the Corwin's 1880 cruise, Captain Hooper located and mapped coal deposits in cliffs east of Cape Lisburne, Alaska, previously discovered by Captain E.E. Smith, the Corwin's ice pilot. The crew mined coal from these deposits in both 1880 and 1881, and the site has since been known as the Corwin coal mine.|$|E
