5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod material from the German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that does not belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be different, but was never sufficiently described.|$|E
5|$|Following an eruption, it is {{very common}} {{for the public to}} hold fears about {{chemical}} contamination of water supplies.

5|$|The type {{material}} was collected in 1990, near the Haast Pass crossing the Makarora River. The specific epithet makarorae refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> locality. P.makarorae is classified in Gastón Guzmán's section Mexicanae {{owing to the}} spore shape and bluing reaction upon injury. It is distinguished from other species in this section {{by the size of}} the caps, the presence of pleurocystidia, and the short-necked cheilocystidia.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and {{continued}} to hold the technological advantage from 1943. A brief threat, {{in the shape of the}} German Type XXI submarine emerged but was too late to alter the course of the war. Technological answers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and magnetic anomaly detectors in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus was belatedly {{described}} in 1923 by William Parks, {{over twenty years}} after the first material was studied by Lawrence Lambe. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as juveniles were once thought to belong to their own genera and species. Currently, the various skulls assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species L. lambei are interpreted as showing age differences and sexual dimorphism. Lambeosaurus was closely related to the better known Corythosaurus, which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera Hypacrosaurus and Olorotitan. All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming {{in the more}} developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of template that they use.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
