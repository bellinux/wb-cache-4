5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen.

5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. <b>To</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London {{has brought the}} {{question}} of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable {{to come to an}} agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant a place at the Olympics. Because at the Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted a place at the Olympics. Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to prove the cycle double cover conjecture using a finite set of reducible configurations. Every reducible configuration contains a cycle, so for every finite set S of reducible configurations there is a number γ such that all configurations in the set contain a cycle of length at most γ. However, there exist snarks with arbitrarily high girth, that is, with arbitrarily high bounds on the length of their shortest cycle. A snark G with girth greater than γ cannot contain any of the configurations in the set S, so the reductions in S are not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> possibility that G might be a minimal counterexample.|$|E
25|$|Long vaned {{feathers}} {{were also}} present {{along the length}} of the tail, and are preserved as a series of long projections of vanes at a 45-degree angle from the tail vertebrae. While preservation makes symmetry difficult to assess, these feathers appear generally similar to the tail feathers of other birdlike dinosaurs that preserve this region, including Sinornithosaurus, Jinfengopteryx, Anchiornis, Eosinopteryx, and Archaeopteryx. This differentiates the tail of Zhenyuanlong from Microraptor and the related Changyuraptor, which had shorter feathers along the base and middle of the tail but large, complex fans at the tip. However, since the end of Zhenyuanlongs tail is not preserved, it's impossible <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> presence of a fan entirely.|$|E

25|$|In capital {{punishment}} cases, in order <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> possibility that police may have forced a confession, the secret {{must be something}} that the police investigation did not discover {{at the time of}} the confession. Moreover, supervision by the prosecutor, in order to maintain the record of investigation, is considered the cornerstone of validity of confession as evidence. Due to its reliance on confession as evidence and proof of guilt, Japanese police put enormous pressure on the suspect to confess a guilty secret as this kind of confession is regarded as strong as forensic evidence. The vast majority of miscarriage of justice cases, in Japanese {{capital punishment}} cases, involve police faking the investigative record to make it appear as if the suspect confessed certain guilty secrets, which only the perpetrator of the crime could have known and it later became apparent that the suspect was being forced to sign a completely blank confession paper which the investigative police filled in for their convenience.|$|E
25|$|Although paleomagnetic {{evidence}} {{can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> 1850s as the age of Cinder Cone, it {{does not}} provide an actual age for its eruption. By measuring levels of carbon-14 in samples of wood from trees killed by the eruption of Cinder Cone, USGS scientists obtained a radiocarbon date for the eruption of between 1630 and 1670. Such a date {{is also consistent with}} the remnant magnetization preserved in the lava flows. The series of eruptions that produced the volcanic deposits at Cinder Cone were complex and are by no means completely understood. However, the new studies done by USGS scientists refute the purported accounts of an eruption in the early 1850s and confirm Diller’s (1891, 1893) interpretation that Cinder Cone erupted {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century. They also suggest that the 1666 tree-ring date proposed by Finch (1937) for his “second” explosive eruption at Cinder Cone might actually date the entire eruptive sequence.|$|E
25|$|Bequaert {{describes}} the extensive color and shape similarities between B. lecheguana {{and a number}} of other species with the word “homeochromic” instead of “mimic”. He lists a number of vespid wasps and potter wasps belonging to the genera Pachodynerus, Odynerus, and Ancistrocerus, and several crabronid wasps of the genera Gorytes and Cerceris. Along with wasps, there are several bee species that are homeochromic, including mason bees of the genera Megachile, Anthidiellum, Hypanthidium, and Dianthidium, Cuckoo bees belonging to the genus Epeolus, stingless Trigona bees, and sweat bees from the genus Halictus. He also lists a soldier fly of the genus Stratiomys as a homeochromic species. While it is unclear what species he is referring to, he cites Stelis costaricensis as a homeochromic species, and while Stelis is a genus of orchid, he did not elaborate enough <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> possibility that he was simply using an outdated name for another insect.|$|E
