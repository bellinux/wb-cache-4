According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the most {{powerful}} kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).|$|E

The production was directed by Jamie Lloyd who also directed McAvoy in his last stint on the stage in 2009's Three Days of Rain. In 2015, McAvoy won the Best Actor award at London's Evening Standard Theater Awards for his portrayal of Jack Gurney in <b>The</b> <b>Ruling</b> <b>Class,</b> {{a revival of the}} Peter Barnes play directed once again by Jamie Lloyd.

5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia. Two kings are known from near {{contemporary}} sources in this early period. The first is Coroticus or Ceretic (Ceredig), known as the recipient of a letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him {{in the second half}} of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E

50|$|In Marxism, bourgeois {{nationalism}} is the alleged practice by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> of deliberately dividing people by nationality, race, ethnicity, or religion, {{so as to}} distract them from initiating class warfare. It {{is seen as a}} divide and conquer strategy used by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> to prevent <b>the</b> working class from uniting against them (hence the Marxist slogan, Workers of all countries, unite!).|$|R
25|$|Unfortunately, Gramsci {{died before}} he could {{completely}} articulate how hegemony mediates the subordinate classes in periods of relative calm or how to work against the powers of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> as exerted in this way. Importantly, however, he had vastly complicated the ways that later Marxists would think about mediation: {{as a means of}} persuasion utilized by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes,</b> rather than as complete control of the available ideas within a given culture (ideology).|$|R
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Supported by the Han military, Minyue was {{established}} in 202 BC and Eastern Ou in 192 BC {{after the fall of}} the Qin dynasty. Zhao Tuo, a former Chinese commander of the Qin, established Nanyue in 208 BC after the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang. Emperor Gaozu, first emperor of the Han dynasty, approved Zhao Tuo's new title as king. Zhao was born in the city of Zhending in Central China, and <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> of the new kingdom was composed of Chinese officials from the former Qin dynasty. In 180 BC, Zhao offered to submit as a vassal state and the Han accepted, a decision partly based on his family's northern Chinese ancestry.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the proletariat}} gained class {{consciousness}} and thus {{was prepared to}} revolt against <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes,</b> <b>the</b> vanguard party would serve another purpose. The party would coordinate the proletariat through its revolution by acting as a military command hub of sorts. This is, according to Leninists, a vital function as mass revolutions can sometimes be easily crushed by the disciplined military of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>The</b> vanguards would serve as commanders of the revolt, chosen to their positions by [...] "democratic natural selection".|$|R

2500|$|Later Marxists such as Gramsci would problematize {{this notion}} of {{ideology}} or false consciousness by studying the ways that workers operate during periods of “organic crisis,” or those times when social classes become detached from their traditional parties and a violent overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> is possible. Seeking to describe the ways that governments regain control of these classes during such periods of unrest, Gramsci developed the idea of hegemony, a process by which social actors within <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> convince subordinate classes to consent to their own oppression once again: ...|$|R
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the tea ceremony among <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> had a significant influence on ceramic production. To satisfy the demand for high quality pottery items necessary to the tea ceremony {{a large number of}} celadon vases and tenmoku ash-glazed teabowls initially were imported from China from the mid-11th to the 16th centuries. These imported items were copied and produced locally at the Seto kiln in Owari Province. Around the mid-16th century adjacent Mino took over as a production center of conservative Chinese inspired Seto style pottery. The Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–1598, and subsequent relocation of Korean potters to Kyushu, brought new pottery styles to Japan. From the late-16th century, Mino potters developed new, distinctly Japanese techniques such as Shino ware or Raku ware. This was also motivated by a general shift of tastes among teamasters and others, who came to prefer simpler unglazed tea bowls formed by hand rather than on a pottery wheel. Of the 14 pottery items in this list, eight entries are chawan bowls used in the tea ceremony, three are flower vases, one is an incense burner, one a tea-leaf jar and one a funerary pot. Eight objects originated in China, five in Japan and one in Korea.|$|E

2500|$|According to Karl Marx, {{the father}} of [...] "scientific socialism", {{religion}} is a tool used by <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> whereby <b>the</b> masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It {{is in the interest}} of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>classes</b> to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism.|$|R
25|$|In their model, {{a country}} starts as a nondemocratic {{society in which}} a small rich group {{controls}} most of the wealth and rules the poor majority. As <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> the rich receive taxation from the economy's output and they decide on the taxation rate as {{the only means of}} extraction. The poor majority can either take what is offered to them by the rich after they tax the output (the economy's output after tax divided by the population size), or they can choose to revolutionize against <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> which comes with a certain cost. In a revolution, the poor's ultimate payoff is the benefit of the revolution minus the cost of the revolution. Under that circumstance, the payoff of the rich ruling class is split between, when the poor revolutionizes, the punishment for <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class</b> and when the poor acquiesces, the taxation income.|$|E
25|$|Veblen concurred with Marx in {{that there}} existed a few {{parasitic}} owners {{of the means of}} production in society who used means of exploitation to maintain that control. While Marx saw the proletariat as rising up against <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class,</b> Veblen believed that the proletariat would instead emulate <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>class.</b> This belief served as the basis for Veblen’s theory of conspicuous consumption. Overall, Veblen held Marx’s economic theories in a high regard. Veblen and Marx also shared similar ideas regarding the importance of technology in provoking social change. Otherwise, Veblen was largely a critic of Marx.|$|E
