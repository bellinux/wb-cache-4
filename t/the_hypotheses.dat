5|$|Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical {{modelling}} {{to examine the}} performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. <b>The</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} machine {{learning}} approach to robust textual inference, in which parses {{of the text}} and <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> sentences are used to measure their asymmetric “similarity”, and thereby to decide if <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> can be inferred. This idea is realized in two different ways. In the first, each sentence is represented as a graph (extracted from a dependency parser) in which the nodes are words/phrases, and the links represent dependencies. A learned, asymmetric, graph-matching cost is then computed to measure the similarity between the text and <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> In <b>the</b> second approach, the text and <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> are parsed into the logical formula-like representation used by (Harabagiu et al., 2000). An abductive theorem prover (using learned costs for making different types of assumptions in the proof) is then applied to try to infer <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> from <b>the</b> text, and the total “cost ” of proving <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is used to decide if <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is entailed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{groups of}} land snails show great {{interspecific}} diversity in shell ornamentation, which may include spines on the shell and flanges on the aperture. Such structures have been explained as camouflage or defence, {{but the possibility}} that they might be under sexual selection has not previously been explored. Presentation of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>The</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that is presented consists of two parts. First, that shell ornamentation is the result of sexual selection. Second, that such sexual selection has caused the divergence in shell shape in different species. Testing <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>The</b> first part of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> may be tested by searching for sexual dimorphism in shell ornamentation in gonochoristic snails, by searching for increased variance in shell ornamentation relative to other shell traits, and by mate choice experiments using individuals with experimentally enhanced ornamentation. The second part of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> may be tested by comparing sister groups and correlating shell diversity with degree of polygamy. Implications of <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> If <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true, it would provide an explanation for the many cases of allopatric evolutionary radiation in snails, where shell diversity cannot be related to any niche differentiation or environmental differences. </p...|$|R
25|$|After using toothpaste, {{orange juice}} and other juices have an {{unpleasant}} taste. Sodium lauryl sulfate alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste. Distinguishing between <b>the</b> <b>hypotheses</b> that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and {{it is thought that}} the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a {{conjecture}} {{is called}} a hypothesis when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on {{the truth of this}} conjecture. These are called conditional proofs: the conjectures assumed appear in <b>the</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of the theorem, for the time being.|$|E
25|$|Many {{intensive}} behavioral interventions {{rely heavily}} on discrete trial teaching (DTT) methods, which use stimulus-response-reward techniques to teach foundational skills such as attention, compliance, and imitation. However, children have problems using DTT-taught skills in natural environments. These students are also taught with naturalistic teaching procedures to help generalize these skills. In functional assessment, a common technique, a teacher formulates a clear description of a problem behavior, identifies antecedents, consequences, and other environmental factors that influence and maintain the behavior, develops hypotheses about what occasions and maintains the behavior, and collects observations to support <b>the</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> A few more-comprehensive ABA programs use multiple assessment and intervention methods individually and dynamically.|$|E

However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} indicates that disruption of the blood–brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease patients allows blood plasma containing amyloid beta (Aβ) to enter the brain where the Aβ adheres preferentially {{to the surface of}} astrocytes. These findings have led to <b>the</b> <b>hypotheses</b> that (1) breakdown of the blood–brain barrier allows access of neuron-binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous Aβ42 to brain neurons and (2) binding of these autoantibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the internalization and accumulation of cell surface-bound Aβ42 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface-bound autoantibodies via endocytosis. Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed, dies, ruptures, and disintegrates, leaving behind the insoluble Aβ42 plaque. Thus, in some patients, Alzheimer's disease may be caused (or more likely, aggravated) by a breakdown in the blood–brain barrier.|$|E

The boxers could have formed the most external part of this arrangement, whereas archers and warriors would have been located in the center, immediately next to the tombs. According to this hypotheses, the nuraghe models would have formed the crowning of the mound, being arranged on the cover slabs of the tombs.|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{a hypothesis}} will be proven (see, rather, null hypothesis).

However, if the outcome is consistent with <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>the</b> experiment is said to support <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also {{be consistent with the}} observations.
