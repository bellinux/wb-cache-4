5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the Air Ministry {{approached}} Morris Motors Limited <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> quickly their Cowley plant {{could be}} turned to aircraft production. In 1936 this informal request for major manufacturing facilities {{was turned into a}} formal scheme to boost British aircraft production capacity under the leadership of Herbert Austin, known as the shadow factory plan. Austin was given the task of building nine new factories, and to supplement the existing British car manufacturing industry by either adding to overall capacity or increasing the potential for reorganisation to produce aircraft and their engines.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E

Is the idea of education embedded in massive online open courses worth embracing? Is automated journalism — with algorithms churning out trivial news stories — compatible with a democratic society? A clever micropayment system won’t answer these questions.|$|R
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns {{the death}} of her husband, Snow White's father, {{although}} she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest.|$|E

25|$|The German Historical School {{rejected}} {{the individual as}} its unit of analysis, instead searching for a more holistic unit of analysis, which inspired Veblen to do the same. The School and Veblen alike preferred this inclusive unit of analysis <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> and why human behavior evolves throughout history. The skepticism of the School regarding laissez-faire economics was also adopted by Veblen.|$|E

25|$|Tucker {{engaged in}} a {{considerable}} amount of research for the Dissertation. He wrote a number of legal scholars and practitioners in the Northern states <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> they had ended slavery or planned to end it. Tucker's Dissertation was also likely one of the first extensively researched treatises on the history of slavery in the British North American colonies, as well as a comprehensive description of the law of slavery in Virginia at the time.|$|E

25|$|Sagan's {{interest}} in UFO reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, {{to write a}} letter to U.S.Secretary of State Dean Acheson <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial. He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with Jacques Vallée. Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public {{interest in}} UFO reports.|$|E
25|$|Once the electron's spin was discovered, it {{was clear}} that the {{magnetism}} should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It was natural <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the 1960 presidential election, both main {{candidates}}, Richard Nixon of the Republican Party and John F. Kennedy of the Democratic Party, {{campaigned on}} the issue of Cuba, with both candidates taking a hardline stance on Castro. Nixon – who was then Vice President – sent a military aide to Dulles <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the planned invasion was progressing; he believed that it was taking too long, considering the swift preparation of the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. Nixon insisted that Kennedy should not be informed of the military plans, to which Dulles conceded.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{is remembered}} {{throughout}} the coaching realms as always being {{a student of}} football. Former Dallas Cowboys' head coach, Bill Parcells, once {{told the story of}} how Wood drove five hours each day for weeks just to watch his Texas Tech linebackers practice. Baylor's former head coach, Grant Teaff, said that Wood once spent the night in his film room just <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> a particular play had been run. He had also been a major opponent to the “no pass, no play” laws of the early 1980s. Wood hardly lost any players after the laws had been passed.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{evacuees}} were also directed to the nearby Concordia University, where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team {{was put in place}} from the CSU and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary crisis centre and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. Claude Dauphin (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events; Dauphin went to the CSU office's the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, and <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> he could help.|$|E
500|$|Most modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different {{ways that the}} mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states. Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance, mental properties supervene on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science. Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved. [...] Modern philosophers of mind continue <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms.|$|E

500|$|Gyllenhaal is {{politically}} active. At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards, she {{spoke out against}} the Iraq war, stating {{the reason for the}} invasion was [...] "oil and imperialism". In 2005, Gyllenhaal drew controversy for her statement that the September 11 attacks were [...] "an occasion to be brave enough to ask some serious questions about America's role in the world ... It is always useful as individuals or nations <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict." [...] Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War. She and her brother Jake filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote, and visited the University of Southern California (USC) campus to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which she supported John Kerry. Gyllenhaal supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. She has campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization her family strongly supports.|$|E
500|$|An {{accomplished}} writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto {{delved into}} fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was {{around this time}} that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, {{due to a lack}} of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. [...] "I'd always had plans from the first time I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, I was going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series.|$|E
500|$|Next {{to appear}} on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier {{statement}} to Fielding.

[...] The answer came back, from the court: [...] "She says {{on the morning of the}} 2nd of January", and Squires replied [...] "I return thanks for telling me, for I am as innocent as the child unborn". [...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>how</b> long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E
