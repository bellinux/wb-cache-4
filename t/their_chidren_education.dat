40|$|Objective of this bachelor's thesis {{whose name}} is Using the Basal {{stimulation}} concept {{in the care of}} children with combined disability was to describe the integration of Basal stimulation concept in care of children with combined disability in the Centrum Bazalka, o. p. s in České Budějovice. Next, find the benefits of Basal stimulation concept from parents of children with combined disability and their view of this. Map out the contribution of the Basal stimulation concept {{from the point of view}} of workers from Centrum Bazalka, o. p. s Methods used: To obtain necessary information for this thesis it was selected the qualitative research method. The method of a semi-structured interview with nurses and parents was used to obtain valid data collection. Respondents: The first research group consisted of four nurses working in the Centrum Bazalka, o. p. s. in České Budějovice. The nurses were selected because they work in the Centrum Bazalka, o. p. s. in České Budějovice. The second research group consisted of parents of children with combined disability. The parents were selected because <b>their</b> <b>chidren</b> attend the Centrum Bazalka, o. p. s. in České Budějovice. Results: By the method of open coding 15 categories were established, categories 1 - 8 for nurses and 9 - 15 for parents. Nurses know the work with Basal stimulation? concept and they apply it in their practice very good. All of the nurses have a cours of Basal stimulation concept. The contribution of Basal stimulation concept is acording of nurses in stimulation of the perception of children and in the better nursing care. In the opinion of the parents of children with combined disability is Basal stimulation concept clearly positive for their children. None of the parents has the cours of Basal stimulation concept.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the contributing factor to motor ability of elementary school children. The tests of 30 m dash and standing long jump were administrated as dependent variables according to the accepted procedures. The conditioning factors were selected from the following areas : children 2 ̆ 7 s domestic atmosphere; experience of disease; diets, and nutritonal status; parental attitudes toward the upbringing of <b>their</b> <b>chidren.</b> The variables were obtained by means of questionnair completed by the children 2 ̆ 7 s parents. The children were the second grade children of Kusagae elementary school in the center-commercial area of Fukuoka-city. The mean score of each dependent. variable of the respective sexes were computed, and the F-values derived from the analysis of variance formed the basis for finding out. the contributing factors. The results obtained are as follows : 1) The following factors are the more important variables influencing physical performance of children. Boys : physical constitutional tendencies to disease; experience of disease; quantity of food intake; tendencies to unbalanced diets. : times of extra snacks; parental attitude toward child upbringing (encouragement of daily activity, taking nutritional drug); degree of daily activity. Girls : birth order; physical consitutional tendencies to disease; quantity of food intake; attitude concerning of foods of herself, and sisters); parental attitudes towards child upbringing (taking nutritional drugs); degree of dally activity. 2) The diets nutritional factor and degree of daily activity, among other things, are the most important in both sexes. The former factor shows higher interrelationships among brothers and sisters than between children and parents. 3) Children 2 ̆ 7 s health status and history of disease correlate to present status of their motor ability. However, the difference between the weak children who suffer from long term illness and the normal children is not significant. 4) The interaction of their constitutional tendecies to disease and the encouragement of daily activity with a few other factors show significant effect on present status of children 2 ̆ 7 s motor ability. The generality of above mentioned results is restricted to present subjects who living at rural district, and dependent variables. The socio-economic status, therefore, should not be rejected. 児童の運動能力に貢献し,あるいは制約すると思われる要因を検索する目的で,運動能力(30 m走,立幅とび) の測定値を従属変量とし,家庭環境・親兄弟に関する要因,疾病の既往歴・健康に関する要因,栄養・食事に関する要因,養育態度に関する要因を内容とした質問紙の結果を結合し一元配置分散分析,二元配置分散分析をほどこした。対象とした児童は福岡市内中心部の商業地域にある小学校在籍者である。結果は次のように要約できる。(1) 従属変量について中央値,最頻値,平均値,尖度,歪度を求めた結果,正規分布と呼べる分布型に近似するといえるが,尖度には問題がある。(2) フェースシート(家庭,親兄弟) に関する項においては有意な効果を認めることはほとんどの場合できなかった。(3) 疾病や健康の領域では胃腸消化器系の疾患がかなり効果をもつことが考えられるが,慢性的な虚弱者とそうでないものの間には,運動能力の差が有意とは認められなかった。(4) 栄養・食事摂取においては偏食傾向の有無,食事量などに有意な効果を認めることができた。しかしそのlinearityに関しては若干問題が残る。(5) 養育態度に関しては栄養剤の投与,友人の年令,運動,遊びの勧めあるいは子ども自身の運動の活発性などに有意な効果があると推察された。(6) 交互作用については体質の強弱とその他二,三の要因間の交互作用,運動のすすめ方,活発性とその他一,二の要因間の交互作用に有意性が認められた。上記の結果は,本研究の対象児童,対象地域,従属変量のうちでのみ一般化され得るものであり,それ故えに家庭環境要因を棄却すべき立場のものではない。従属変量,要因の整理もしくは拡大が今後に不可欠な問題であり,また縦断的なデータの蓄積が必要である...|$|R

As crianças foram submetidas a coleta de sangue para dosagem de hemoglobina. Em seguida, foi prescrito dosagem de 12 mg/dia de ferro elementar, por 30 dias. Observou-se que 25 % dos menores de 6 meses apresentaram níveis de hemoglobina inferiores a 11, 0 g/dl. As maiores ocorrências de anemia foram detectadas entre os 9 e 23 meses de idade (50, 0 %). Decorrido o prazo, apenas 37, 4 % das crianças com anemia e 52, 4 % das não anêmicas retornaram para reavaliação. Das 299 que foram reavaliadas, somente 157 (52, 5 %) receberam a medicação corretamente. A freqüência de hemoglobinas inferiores a 9, 5 g/dl caiu de 17, 1 % no início, para 8, 1 % ao final da intervenção. Por outro lado, o percentual de crianças com hemoglobinas superiores a 12, 0 g/dl subiu de 13, 4 %, para 33, 4 %. As que receberam a suplementação férrica de forma correta registraram queda nos índices de anemia sensivelmente maior que a observada naquelas suplementadas de forma incorreta. Concluiu-se que a terapêutica com doses profiláticas de sulfato ferroso, apesar de se mostrar eficiente na recuperação dos níveis de hemoglobina, apresenta sérios entraves do ponto de vista operacional. The {{efficacy}} of medical prophylaxis {{in the fight}} against iron deficiency anemia in 620 children aged from four to thirty-six months, attended in two health units of the municipality of S.

Then they received daily doses of iron sulphate in the form of drops, corresponding to 12 mg/ day of elementary iron, over a 30 -day period. Afterwaeds, they were asked to return for re-evaluation. Twenty-five percent of children under 6 months presented hemoglobin levels under 11. 0 g/dl. The highest occurrences of anemia were detected among children aged 9 to 11 months (49. 5 %) and in the age bracket between 12 and 23 months (50. 4 %). After the established period, only 37. 4 % of the children with anemia and 52. 4 % of children who did not present anaemia returned for further evaluation.

"You {{would not}} have found me," [...] said his father, narrating how he with a large troop of captives had been driven down to the coast; where they were {{transferred}} to a Moorish slave-dealer, who shipped them off for Tunis. Here, after their first taste of the miseries of a sea life, the alternative of Islam or slavery was again put before them. [...] "And, by the holy stone of Nicaea," [...] said Sir Eberhard, [...] "I thought by that time that the infidels {{had the advantage of}} us in good-will and friendliness; but, when they told me women had no souls at all, no more than a horse or dog, I knew it was but an empty dream of a religion; for did I not know that my little Ermentrude, and thou, Stine, had finer, clearer, wiser souls than ever a man I had known? 'Nay, nay,' quoth I, 'I'll cast in my lot where I may meet my wife hereafter, should I never see her here.'" [...] He had then been allotted to a corsair, and had thenceforth been chained to the bench of rowers, between the two decks, where, in stifling heat and stench, in storm or calm, healthy or diseased, the wretched oarsmen were compelled to play the part of machinery in propelling the vessel, in order to capture Christian ships--making exertions to which only the perpetual lash of the galley-master could have urged their exhausted frames; often not desisting for twenty or thirty hours, and rowing still while sustenance was put into their mouths by their drivers. Many a man drew has last breath with his last stroke, and was at the first leisure moment hurled into the waves. It was the description that had so deeply moved Friedel long ago, and Christina wept over it, as she looked at the bowed form once so proud and free, and thought of the unhealed scars.

See"--and he took out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed; [...] "that is what he left me when he died, and what I meant to have been telling for ever up in the hermitage." ...|$|R
