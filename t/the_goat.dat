5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as <b>The</b> <b>Goat,</b> The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat,</b> Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, {{including}} The Time of the Hero and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa). Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter {{was turned into}} the English-language film, Tune in Tomorrow. The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.|$|E
5000|$|The {{association}} initially preferred registered goats to be {{descended from}} known European breeds, but {{was willing to}} accept upgraded goats as well. [...] In addition to its eight currently registered breeds, the ADGA at one time registered several other breeds that are no longer available in North America, including <b>the</b> British Alpine <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Calcutta Llama, <b>the</b> Indian <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Maltese <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Murcien or Murciene, <b>the</b> Norska <b>goat</b> (and other Norwegian breeds), <b>the</b> Rock Alpine <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Rome <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> Royal Murciana <b>goat,</b> and <b>the</b> Schwartzenberg-Guggisberger <b>goat.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the film, Weslie and {{his crew}} {{discover}} an evil mechanical dragon who defeats Wolffy as he was attempting to capture <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> {{but a series of}} good dragons rescue Weslie and <b>the</b> <b>goats.</b> <b>The</b> good dragons say that evil dragons have taken over their world, and they need the help of <b>the</b> <b>goats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The tigers win if they capture {{enough of}} <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> cannot {{effectively}} block {{the movements of}} the tigers, and this is usually when <b>the</b> number of <b>goats</b> are reduced to 10.|$|R
5|$|The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> {{received}} largely positive reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} book's depiction {{of the relationship between}} sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. <b>The</b> <b>Goat</b> Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. <b>The</b> <b>Goat</b> Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E
50|$|Capra is a genus of mammals, <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> {{composed}} {{of up to}} nine species, including <b>the</b> wild <b>goat,</b> <b>the</b> markhor, and several species known as ibex. <b>The</b> domestic <b>goat</b> (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a domesticated subspecies of <b>the</b> wild <b>goat</b> (Capra aegagrus). Evidence of goat domestication dates back more than 8,500 years.|$|R
5000|$|In the Bible, {{to be at}} {{the right}} side [...] "is to be {{identified}} as being in the special place of honor". In Jesus' The Sheep and <b>the</b> <b>Goats,</b> <b>the</b> sheep and <b>goats</b> are separated with the sheep on the right hand of God and <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> on <b>the</b> left hand.|$|R
50|$|Rucyl was an {{original}} member of underground hip-hop group <b>The</b> <b>Goats</b> (Ruffhouse/Columbia Records) from 1992-1994. <b>The</b> <b>Goats</b> toured and performed internationally with bands like Bad Brains, Fishbone, and The Beastie Boys.|$|R
5|$|The {{deployment}} to Cyprus {{with the}} 1st Battalion was Billy's first overseas posting, and despite being ordered {{to keep in}} line, he refused to obey. He failed to keep in step, and tried to headbutt a drummer. <b>The</b> <b>goat</b> major, Lance Corporal Dai Davies, 22, from Neath, South Wales, was unable to keep him under control.|$|E
5|$|While {{based on}} true events, {{a number of}} {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film have been noted. Early in the film, the four-man SEAL reconnaissance team is discovered by three goat herders—an elderly man and two teenage boys. In fact, Marcus Luttrell wrote in his book that only one of <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> herders was a teenage boy, not two.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage of arrows, the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E
50|$|Cashmere is {{collected}} during the spring moulting season when <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> naturally shed their winter coat. In the Northern Hemisphere, <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> moult as early as March and as late as May.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{residents}} advocated preserving <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> likening them {{to officially}} sanctioned public art projects in other municipalities. [...] Local business owners collected some 50 signatures on {{a petition to}} preserve <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> as a permanent installation. [...] <b>The</b> <b>goats</b> became <b>the</b> subject of a Facebook page, tattoos, and a drink special; one area business owner placed the stencil on his store's facade. [...] Several products with <b>the</b> red <b>goat</b> icon were made available for purchase in a shop {{on the web site}} Etsy.|$|R
25|$|H. A. Rey has {{suggested}} an alternative visualization, which graphically shows a <b>goat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>goat's</b> head is {{formed by the}} triangle of stars ι Cap, θ Cap, and ζ Cap. <b>The</b> <b>goat's</b> horn sticks out with stars γ Cap and δ Cap. Star δ Cap, {{at the tip of}} the horn, is of the third magnitude. <b>The</b> <b>goat's</b> tail consists of stars β Cap and α2 Cap: star β Cap being of the third magnitude. <b>The</b> <b>goat's</b> hind foot consists of stars ψ Cap and ω Cap. Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude.|$|R
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat,</b> for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
50|$|In Falmouth, PA, {{there is}} an annual Running of <b>the</b> <b>Goats,</b> which has {{happened}} for 33 years. On Saturday, September 28, 2013, Running of <b>the</b> <b>Goats</b> will be held for the 34th time. <b>The</b> Falmouth <b>goat</b> race is organized by the Falmouth Civic Association and it includes a craft fair as well as food stands.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Goats,</b> Music and More Festival celebrates <b>the</b> fainting <b>goat.</b> It is held {{annually}} in October, in Marshall County, Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|Feral goats are {{a fairly}} common {{sight in the}} Scottish Highlands. <b>The</b> <b>goats</b> are {{descendants}} of livestock abandoned, through necessity, by Highlanders during the Highland Clearances. <b>The</b> <b>goats</b> act as a living reminder of the region's turbulent past.|$|R
5|$|Coffee Stain Studios {{released}} Goat Simulator worldwide on 1 April 2014, {{aware that}} tying the date with April Fools' Day may raise doubts on {{the validity of}} the game. Those that pre-ordered the game through Coffee Stain's website received early access to the title three days ahead of release. The official release trailer for Goat Simulator is a loose parody of the highly praised teaser trailer released for Dead Island, showing, among shots of the game, reversed slow-motion footage of <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> crashing through a building after being launched from an exploding gas station.|$|E
5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns <b>the</b> <b>goat</b> into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
60|$|As for <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> {{occasionally}} {{you come}} across a black, misanthropic ram, nibbling the scant herbage of some height inaccessible to man, in preference to the sweet grasses of the valley below. <b>The</b> <b>goats</b> are not very numerous.|$|R
5000|$|In one of {{the lighter}} moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will {{separate}} men as a shepherd separates his flock into sheep and <b>goats.</b> <b>The</b> sheep will enter heaven while <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> must suffer eternal damnation. [...] "We Beseech Thee" [...] cry <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> begging for mercy.|$|R
50|$|The player {{controlling}} <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> moves first, {{by placing}} a goat onto a free intersection on the board. Tigers may move along the lines from one intersection to another. Once all of <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> have been placed on <b>the</b> board, <b>goats</b> must move {{in the same fashion}} as the tigers, one intersection to another. Moves alternate between players.|$|R
5|$|Recent {{schools to}} open in Ashford include Repton Manor Primary School, built on the former Templar Barracks, which opened in September 2012 and <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> Lees Community Primary School, which opened in September 2013. In {{addition}} to the grammar schools, {{there are a number}} of other secondary schools, including those catering for special needs. Ashford College is on Henwood, to the east of town; a new college building is being constructed in the town centre, expected {{to open in}} 2017.|$|E
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Goat</b> can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. <b>The</b> <b>goat</b> and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
50|$|The plot follows <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> {{who go to}} {{the moon}} in a candy-shaped {{spaceship}} in order to assist the Queen of the Moon. The Bitter Gourd King and his gourd troopers are attacking the World of Sweetness with bitter juice, and the Queen needs the help of <b>the</b> <b>goats.</b> Wolfie and his family come with <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> by accident. At one point the Gourd King kidnaps Wolfie's family, and Weslie comes to tears upon seeing his parents.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{species were}} {{introduced}} to the Galápagos by pirates. Thor Heyerdahl quoted documents that mention the Viceroy of Peru, knowing that British pirates ate <b>the</b> <b>goats</b> that they themselves had released in the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>goats.</b> [...] Also, when colonization of Floreana by José de Villamil failed, he ordered <b>the</b> <b>goats,</b> donkeys, cattle and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization.|$|R
