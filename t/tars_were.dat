2500|$|In the {{earliest}} days of MGP operations, coal tar was considered a waste and often disposed into the environment in and around the plant locations. While uses for coal tar developed by the late-19th century, the market for tar varied and plants that could not sell tar at a given time could store tar for future use, attempt to burn it as fuel for the boilers, or dump the tar as waste. Commonly, waste <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> disposed of in old gas holders, adits or even mine shafts (if present). Over time, the waste tars degrade with phenols, benzene (and other mono-aromatics – BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released as pollutant plumes that can escape into the surrounding environment. Other wastes included [...] "blue billy", which is a ferroferricyanide compound—the blue colour is from Prussian blue, which was commercially used as a dye. Blue billy is typically a granular material and was sometimes sold locally with the strap line [...] "guaranteed weed free drives". The presence of blue billy can give gas works waste a characteristic musty/bitter almonds or marzipan smell which is associated with cyanide gas.|$|E

There is a good deal of fun in it, so long as you are not hit; but a hit--in the judgment of discreet persons--spoils the sport completely. When this pastime is practiced by connoisseurs ashore, they wear heavy, wired helmets, to break the force of the blows.

60|$|The <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> now at work {{firing the}} gingals {{attached}} to the bulwarks and the matchlocks with which the deck was strewn, at the approaching junks. As they took steady aim, leaning their pieces on the bulwarks, they did considerable execution among the Chinamen crowded on board the junks, while the shot of the Chinese, for the most part, whistled far overhead; but the guns of the shore battery, which had now slewed round to bear upon them, opened with a better aim, and several shots came crashing into {{the sides of the}} two captured junks.|$|E

60|$|As {{an example}} of the caprice of sailors, and their sympathy with {{suffering}} among members of their own calling, I must mention the case of an old man, who every day, and all day long, through sunshine and rain, occupied a particular corner, where crowds of <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> always passing. He was an uncommonly large, plethoric man, with a wooden leg, and dressed in the nautical garb; his face was red and round; he was continually merry; and with his wooden stump thrust forth, so as almost to trip up the careless wayfarer, he sat upon a great pile of monkey jackets, with a little depression in them between his knees, to receive the coppers thrown him. And plenty of pennies were tost into his poor-box by the sailors, who always exchanged a pleasant word with the old man, and passed on, generally regardless of the neighboring beggars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tar</b> <b>was</b> used as seal for roofing {{shingles}} and tar {{paper and}} {{to seal the}} hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, wood <b>tar</b> <b>was</b> used to waterproof sails and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for <b>tar.</b> Wood <b>tar</b> <b>is</b> still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. <b>Tar</b> <b>is</b> also a general disinfectant. Pine tar oil, or wood <b>tar</b> oil, <b>is</b> a pure natural product used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries. Pine tar has good penetration on the rough wood. An old wood tar oil recipe {{for the treatment of}} wood is one-third each genuine wood tar, balsam turpentine, and boiled or raw linseed oil or Chinese tung oil.|$|R

60|$|Now {{this case}} also {{occurred}} before the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society was instituted. I cannot say that such cases of rough handling were frequent; but {{cases in which}} true-blue shipwrecked <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> treated as impostors were numerous, so that, in those days, knaves and rascals often throve as wrecked seamen, while the genuine and unfortunate men were often turned rudely from door to door. This state of things does not exist now. It cannot exist now, for honorary agents of the society {{are to be found}} on every part of our coasts, so that the moment a wrecked man touches the land, no matter whether he be a Briton or a foreigner, he is at once taken care of, clothed, housed, fed, supplied with a little money, and forwarded to his home, or to the nearest consul of his nation. The society has therefore accomplished two great and good objects, for which the entire nation owes it a debt of gratitude; it has rid the land of begging impostors clad in sailors' clothes, and it has provided relief and assistance to the shipwrecked among our brave and hardy seamen who are in every sense the bulwarks of our island, and without whose labours, in the most perilous of all callings, Great Britain {{would be one of the}} poorest and most uninfluential kingdoms on the face of the earth.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of this alliance for Athens was that it provided them with a source of <b>tar.</b> <b>Tar</b> <b>is</b> a more effective protector of ship planking than pitch (which is made from pine trees).

The <b>tar</b> <b>was</b> dredged {{up from the bottom}} of a lake (now known as Lake Keri) using leafy myrtle branches tied to the ends of poles.

40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} is {{an effective}} way to produce syngas that must be conditioned to remove the main pollutants (tars) for its use in energy production systems. Catalytic steam reforming of tar and CH 4 is thus necessary; Nickel catalysts are excellent candidates but still have deactivation problems related to carbon deposition and sulphur poisoning. Various studies demonstrated that Mayenite as binder for Nickel has free oxygen ions that protect the catalyst from coke formation and H 2 S poisoning. Similar studies are carried out only with tar representative compounds (e. g. toluene); here the catalyst was tested with real syngas from biomass gasification containing CH 4, benzene and tars. Ni/Mayenite was synthesized with citrate sol-gel method, characterized (XRD, BET, SEM, XRF), tested for 50 h and again characterized in order to study its degradation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: College and {{university}} students experience substantial morbidity from influenza and influenza-like illness, {{and they can}} benefit substantially from vaccination. Public health authorities encourage vaccination not only before the influenza season but also into and even throughout the influenza season. We conducted the present study {{to assess the impact}} of various vaccination strategies including delayed (i. e., in-season) vaccination on influenza outbreaks on a college campus. METHODS/FINDINGS: We used a Susceptible [...] > Infected [...] > Recovered (SIR) framework for our mathematical models to simulate influenza epidemics in a closed, college campus. We included both students and faculty/staff in the model and derived values for the model parameters from the published literature. The values for key model parameters were varied to assess the impact on the outbreak of various pre-season and delayed vaccination rates; one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the sensitivity of the model outputs to changes in selected parameter values. In the base case, with a pre-season vaccination rate of 20 %, no delayed vaccination, and 1 student index case, the total attack rate (total percent infected, TAR) was 45 %. With higher pre-season vaccination rates <b>TARs</b> <b>were</b> lower. Even if vaccinations were given 30 days after outbreak onset, <b>TARs</b> <b>were</b> still lower than the TAR of 69 % in the absence of vaccination. Varying the proportions of vaccinations given pre-season versus delayed until after the onset of the outbreak gave intermediate TAR values. Base case outputs were sensitive to changes in infectious contact rates and infectious periods and a holiday/break schedule. CONCLUSION: Delayed vaccination and holidays/breaks can be important adjunctive measures to complement traditional pre-season influenza vaccination for controlling and preventing influenza in a closed college campus...|$|E
40|$|Acid tars are waste {{residues}} of obsolete benzole refining, oil re-refining {{and white}} oil production processes. They are black, acidic, viscous semi-liquids comprising an extremely complex mixture of water, sulfuric acid {{and a large}} range of organic compounds. Acid <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> often dumped into excavations and existing holes in the ground together with various co-disposed materials without any treatment or engineered lining system leaving a legacy of acid tar lagoons. Acid tars may pose potential risks to {{human health and the}} environment because of their acidity, volatiles and other hazardous components. The major contamination pathways of acid tar lagoons are considered to be direct contact, gas emission, bulk tar migration offsite, and surface and ground water contamination. The leaching, weathering and migration behaviours of acid <b>tars</b> <b>were</b> investigated by carrying out a series of batch, cascade and flow cell tests. The results demonstrated that acid tars are capable of leaching Significant levels of contaminants if disturbed, while the leaching level is Significantly lower under simulated groundwater flow in a model soil. The time scale to leaching stabilization was of the order of months in the model soil and is expected to significantly exceed that in the natural environment. To support this work a nubmber of analytical methods for determining physical and chemical properties of acid tars had to be adapted from standard techniques. These modified techniques are described in detail together with recommendations for data integration and correlation of all analyses to form a better understanding of acid tars and their potential environmental impact. The overall findings of the research were integrated to generate a conceptual model of acid tar lagoon processes to assist in assessment. Monitored Natural Attenuation was evaluated and is considered to be a potentially viable approach to the environmental management of some acid tar lagoons...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} the Amazon River is a much-discussed subject, and {{the timing of the}} {{development}} of a transcontinental system in particular is a matter of some controversy, with estimations varying between the Early Miocene and the Pliocene or even the Pleistocene. To shed further light on this, we studied the sediment provenance of an Oligocene to Late Pleistocene marine sedimentary section from the Ceara Rise (ODP Site 925), a topographic high in the central Atlantic Ocean, using major element concentrations and Nd isotopic composition in 85 samples. In addition, the carbon isotopic composition of bulk organic matter and changes in the distribution of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) were used to identify periods of increased river outflow. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the {{history of the}} development of the Amazon River is characterized by specific steps. During the late Oligocene/Early Miocene (30 - 18. 3 Ma), the terrigenous mass accumulation rates (<b>TARs)</b> <b>were</b> high, and sediment and GDGT compositions suggest that a large river system existed, which at times received weathering products from a younger and probably Andean sediment source. A shift to a younger Andean sediment provenance after 8. 7 Ma indicates that the Amazon River became permanently connected with the Andes. Between 18. 3 and 4. 5 Ma, <b>TARs</b> <b>were</b> generally low, and GDGTs were derived for the most part from in situ production in marine waters. Around 4. 5 Ma, the river expanded, probably due to ongoing tectonic activity, and uplift in the Andes increased Andean rock erosion. This led to a strong increase in terrigenous sediment deposition and enhanced organic matter preservation on the Ceara Rise, and the delivery of terrestrial (both soil and riverine) branched GDGTs to the Ceara Rise...|$|E
