5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy enough for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
5|$|North Island's primary {{human use}} is as a {{seasonal}} camp for Western Rock Lobster fishers. During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, North Island's camp {{is occupied by}} about 130 fishers. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and taking out the catch and any domestic waste.|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> named <b>Camp</b> Wynkoop in May 1864, {{in honor}} of Fort Lyon's commander, Maj. Edward W. Wynkoop. Around that time a stage station <b>was</b> built at <b>Camp</b> Wynkoop. When <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> again {{abandoned}} in August the stage station remained. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> in a dangerous area, as hostile Indians at least once killed four soldiers working near <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> {{closed by}} <b>the</b> Germans because <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> {{too small and}} located between the dunes. It {{was not easy to}} enlarge it. In October 1941 <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> closed. Some of the prisonars were released, but most of the prisoners were {{transferred}} to Kamp Amersfoort. 25 women were directly transported to concentration camp Ravensbrück.|$|R
5|$|Now {{in charge}} of the {{resistance}} on Naboo, Sykes leads a mission to liberate the Camp 4, a detention center where the Trade Federation has placed most of Naboo's important leaders. After <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> freed, Sykes is contacted by Captain Panaka, and the plan to finally liberate Naboo is set in motion. After taking part in the diversionary attack on Theed that allows Queen Amidala and Panaka to infiltrate the Palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray, Sykes joins the rest of Bravo Flight in the climactic assault on the Droid Control Ship. Partnered with R2-C4, Sykes knocks out the Droid Control Ship's Shield Generator, which allows young Anakin Skywalker to destroy the ship from within. With the Trade Federation army disabled, Naboo is freed.|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are {{shot and killed}} {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, a Nazi {{concentration}} <b>camp,</b> Kamp Erika, <b>was</b> {{situated at}} the Besthemerberg.

5|$|Leonard Powers, the Wizard of Social Services, {{is about}} to retire and takes his {{apprentice}} to Mount Magic to complete the initiation ceremony. For a wizard to retire, they must hatch their apprentice from an egg and train them for fifty years. However, Leonard abandoned his apprentice, the Harry Potter-like Lionel, in Chinatown and did not contact him until the ceremony. Later, it is revealed that to become a wizard, the apprentices must be circumcised. Meanwhile, the demons—the wizard's enemies—are ready to attack Mount Magic, but a force field is keeping them out. Since Leonard still needs to sign his retirement forms, demons Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone decide to use Mark Lilly to lead them to Leonard. To get Mark to come along, they elect him as the camp leader for a summer camp (originally a mining camp) that they build nearby. Mark brings his students from the Department of Integration to the camp, and the devil, Aldermach, brings several demons to act like the camp's visitors. The department's police officer, Frank Grimes, also comes along, but runs away to live with bears as he thinks <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> infested by vermin. Mark's students and his roommate, the zombie Randall, begin to mine in an old silver mine. However, they get trapped inside, but Doug the koala begins to dig them out.|$|E
