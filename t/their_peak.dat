5|$|As {{a result}} of the Sino-Soviet split, {{tensions}} along the Chinese–Soviet border reached <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> in 1969, and United States President Richard Nixon decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War. The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.|$|E

5|$|Feeder are a Welsh {{rock band}} formed in Newport, Wales. They have {{released}} ten studio albums, twelve compilations, four EPs, and 40 singles. They {{have spent a}} total of 182 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2017, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. At <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> of commercial success, Feeder won two Kerrang! Awards in 2001 and 2003 (Best British Live Act and later Best British Band).|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{remained}} in England until 1148. The disorders were at <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never secure enough support to enable {{her to be}} crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E

At <b>their</b> <b>peak,</b> the Yugoslav and Serb forces {{in the vicinity of}} Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} bred {{for use on}} farms, {{few members}} of the breed are used for agricultural purposes today, and are now mostly bred for horse shows and working in urban areas. However, the Carlsberg brewery has used the Jutland to pull its drays since 1928. The brewery owned 210Jutlands at <b>their</b> <b>peak,</b> and today still uses about 20 for transporting beer around Copenhagen. The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{a pair of}} previously unknown rings, now called the outer ring system, which brought the number of known Uranian rings to 13. These rings were subsequently named the μ and ν rings. The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice {{the distance from the}} planet as the bright η ring. The outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings in a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. <b>Their</b> <b>peak</b> normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> level.|$|E

5|$|Malawi's {{climate is}} {{hot in the}} low-lying areas {{in the south of}} the country and {{temperate}} in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, with almost no rainfall during these months.|$|E
5|$|The Billboard Hot 100 is a {{chart that}} ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, {{the data are}} {{compiled}} by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical sales and airplay. In 2002, there were seven singles that topped the chart, the lowest number of singles to top the chart {{in a single year}} ever (if the two songs which peaked in 2001 are included, 2002 would have the second lowest number of chart-topping singles in a year, behind 2005). Although nine singles reached number one in fifty-two issues of the magazine in the calendar year, two songs began <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> position in 2001 and are thus excluded.|$|E
5|$|The Supremes were an American female singing {{group and}} the premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially {{successful}} of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and {{it is said that}} their success made it possible for future African American R and soul musicians to find mainstream success.|$|E

5|$|The bald eagle's {{natural range}} covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, {{they are much more}} common (almost attaining <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The same {{social forces}} that had built these resorts {{in the nineteenth}} century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links {{continued}} to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at Ostend became popular with Northern working-class tourists {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, and the introduction of package holidays in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> and the town's economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.|$|E
5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At <b>their</b> <b>peak</b> the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
