Major emphasis was put on the fracture mechanics approach to assessing whether or not the solidifying U 0 2 would fracture under the thermally induced stresses.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} gasification and combustion characteristics of chars derived from an inertinite-rich coal discard sample with a high ash content. Fundamental knowledge of the reaction rate kinetics for char conversion at reactions conditions used in fluidised bed gasification and combustion was obtained. For this purpose, characterisation of the parent coal and derived chars, reactivity determinations of the chars and detailed reaction rate modelling was undertaken. The characterisation performed consisted of standard coal analytical methods. petrographic techniques, CCSEM image analysis and a surface adsorption method. The parent coal consists of 32 % by volume of inertinite, 7 % of vitrinite, 13 % of biand tri-macerite, 30 % of maceral/mineral mixtures (carbominerite) with 18 % of mineral-rich material. Reflectances obtained from measurements taken on vitrinites and total maceral reflectance scans increased dramatically on charring at 900 °C and is accompanied by an extension of vitrinite-class distribution. Volatiles were liberated essentially from the original parent vitrinites, creating fine pores. Inertinites increased in reflectance but not in porosity and are characterised as dense char fractions in the final charred product, which was established according to a coal form analysis. Structural change due to low temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> <b>fracturing</b> ("passive deflagration") occurred {{early on in the}} temperature regimes, creating increased surface areas and porosity. The chars consist of a high proportion (52 %) of extraneous rock fragments together with minerals mainly as fine inclusions in carbon rich particles. The chars have very low porosities and surface areas created by devolatisation of maceral associations and deflagration. Combustion and gasification reactivity experiments were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyser at 87. 5 and 287. 5 kPa pressures between 700 and 900 'C and with varying mixtures of oxygen/nitrogen and carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixtures respectively. The effects of temperature, pressure, gas composition and particle size on reactivity were found to confirm well-established trends. The effect of temperature in the high temperature range was, however, strongly affected by pore and film diffusion during combustion. Models based on the random pore model without and with pore diffusion incorporating the properties of the char (porosity. ash content, and derived structural parameter) and structural mechanisms concerning carbon removal, were successfully solved and validated against experimental results. As a result of the complexity of the models consisting of many unknown parameters, a procedure consisting of step-wise regression was developed and applied successfully. This procedure uses a unified carbon conversion versus a reduced time parameter plot with the latter defined as real time/time for 90 % conversion. It was found that for char panicles with a mean diameter of 1 mm prepared at 900 °C. the random pore model (chemical reaction controlling) was applicable for predicting the gasification reaction rate with carbon dioxide-nitrogen mixtures at temperatures up to 9 OO'C, whereas for the combustion reactions with oxygen-nitrogen mixtures an adapted chemical reaction-pore diffusion model was found to be applicable in the temperature range 450 to 600 °C. The model is characterised by a variable Thiele modulus which can account for pore- diffusion and can undergo a transition to a chemically controlled reaction {{as a result of the}} depletion of carbon in the carbon/mineral matrix. Intrinsic reaction rate parameters for gasification and combustion are reported and compared with published results, and were Sound to be slightly different. Diffusion coefficients were also evaluated from the combustion reaction results and found to compare very well with predictions with the Knudsen diffusion model. Doctora...|$|E

Sodalime glass is {{the most common form of}} glass whose application includes manufacture of glass plates which are used in modern devices including TFT-LCDs, touch panels, thin-film solar cells, and color filters. For any application, the cutting of glass is the initial step in fabrication. The conventional method of glass cutting involves using a diamond point tool or wheel to mechanically score a line along the desired path. This is followed by application of bending force to break the glass along the scored line. This method has disadvantages that include: microcracks that serve as stress risers of tension and cause the fracture of the glass if loaded, rough edges requiring further machining and material wastage among others. Laser cutting has numerous advantages over the conventional methods regarding quality and is attaining wide acceptance in ma-chining of glass.

Specifically, our models predict he devel-opment of thermal bending moments which depend on lithosphere thickness or age and therefore change across fracture zones.

The predicted amplitude of the resulting geoid anomaly is large enough to be observed in Seasat altimeter profiles. Furthermore, the general form of this anomaly differs ufficiently from other predicted components ofthe geoid anomaly at fracture zones to be discernable.

In this paper, an exact and complete fundamental solution is derived for the problem of a penny-shaped crack in magneto-electro-thermo-elastic material under prescribed thermal flux on the crack faces. The problem is analyzed {{within the framework of}} the theory of linear magneto-electro-thermo-elasticity. Electro-magneto-thermo-elasticity includes the effective elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability and electromagnetic coupling moduli, as well as the effective thermal expansion coefficients and the associated pyroelectric and pyromagnetic constants. The coupling features of transversely isotropic magneto-electro-thermo-elastic solids are governed by a system of partial differential equations with respect to the elastic displacements, the electric potential and the magnetic potential and temperature field. The heat conduction equation and equilibrium equations for an infinite magneto-electro-thermo-elastic media are solved by means of Hankel integral transform.

Subjects were reviewed regularly and those with clinical suspicion of <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> were assessed using bone scan and X-rays. Results: The incidence of <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> was 20 % during basic training, 14 % during advanced training and 23 % during unit training. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of tibial and femoral <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> versus metatarsal <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> before and after the completion of phase II training at week 26 (p = 0. 0001). Seventy-eight percent of the <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> during phases I and II training were either tibial or femoral, while 91 % of the <b>stress</b> <b>fractures</b> in phase III training were metatarsal...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} polymorphisms within candidate genes which we hypothesized may contribute to <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> predisposition, a case-control, cross- sectional study design was employed. Genotyping 268 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms- SNPs within 17 genes in 385 Israeli young male and female recruits (182 with and 203 without <b>stress</b> <b>fractures).</b> Twenty-five polymorphisms within 9 genes (NR 3 C 1, ANKH, VDR, ROR 2, CALCR, IL 6, COL 1 A 2, CBG, and LRP 4) showed statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the distribution between <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> cases and non <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> controls. Seventeen genetic variants were {{associated with an increased}} <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> risk, and eight variants with a decreased <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> risk. None of the SNP associations remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate- FDR). Our findings suggest that genes may be involved in <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> pathogenesis. Specifically, the CALCR and the VDR genes are intriguing candidates. The putative involvement of these genes in <b>stress</b> <b>fracture</b> predisposition requires analysis of more cases and controls and sequencing the relevant genomic regions, in order to define the specific gene mutation...|$|R
