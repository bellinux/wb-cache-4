The current status leaves great potential to improve the system towards a sustainable irrigation management. Nevertheless, the participation in international conferences and the trend of the government to decentralize the system and implement a participatory based irrigation management strategy suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> is willing to develop its policies further in order to gain long-term food security and save its natural resources at the same time.|$|E

During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge {{in the midst of this}} nation". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, [...] "we are no petty people".|$|E

They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Malay and Islam became the {{national}} language and official religion, while the Malay rulers remained. This {{was taken to}} mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan {{would be the same}} as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many, gave Malaya a Malay identity. One academic suggested that [...] "The Malays have a deep-rooted feeling that they alone are the bumiputras, the sons of the soil, and as such have certain special rights over the land." [...] Indeed, the Tunku said in 1964 that [...] "It is understood by all <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> by its very name, its traditions and character, is Malay. ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields, eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people. But not with the Malays. Therefore, in return, they must appreciate the position of the Malays..." [...] It has been suggested that a Malaysian nationality did not emerge because [...] "all the national symbols in Malaysia were derived from the Malay tradition".|$|E

The United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, Walter Hines Page, wrote [...] "The submarines are sinking freight ships faster than freight ships are being built by the whole world. In this way, too, then, the Germans are succeeding. Now if this goes on long enough, the Allies' game is up. For instance, they have lately sunk so many fuel oil ships, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> may very soon be in a perilous condition — even the Grand Fleet may not have enough fuel". Georges Clemenceau wrote to US president Wilson [...] "Gasoline is as vital as blood in the coming battles…a failure in the supply of gasoline would cause the immediate paralysis of our armies". Wilson reacted strongly. The War Shipping Board commandeered all ships in the United States and also took over all yards. An unprecedented budget of $US1.3 billion was used for this end. At Hog Island, the largest shipyard {{in the world was}} built, known for the Hog Islander.|$|E

2500|$|Both the Russian and Spanish empires held no {{significant}} plans at promoting colonies along the Northwest Coast by the 1810s. The British and the Americans were {{the remaining two}} nations with citizens active in commercial operations in the region. Starting with a party of the Montreal based North West Company (NWC) employees led by David Thompson in 1807, the British began land-based operations and opened trading posts throughout the region. Thompson extensively explored the Columbia River watershed. While at the junction of Columbia and Snake Rivers, he erected a pole on July 9, 1811, with a notice stating [...] "Know hereby <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> is claimed by Great Britain {{as part of its}} territories..." [...] and additionally stated the intention of the NWC to build a trading post there. Fort Nez Percés was later established at the location in 1818. The American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) began operations in 1811 at Fort Astoria, constructed at the entrance of the Columbia River. The eruption of the War of 1812 didn't lead to a violent confrontation in the Pacific Northwest between the competing companies. Led by Donald Mackenzie, PFC officers agreed to liquidate its assets to their NWC competitors, with an agreement signed on 23 November 1813. The HMS Racoon was ordered to capture Fort Astoria, though by the time it arrived, the post was already under NWC management. After the collapse of the PFC, American mountain men operated in small groups in the region, typically based east of the Rocky Mountains, only to meet once a year at the annual Rendezvous.|$|E
2500|$|I am sure every Englishman {{who has a}} {{heart in}} his breast {{and a feeling of}} justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> could have been able to draw the sword {{successfully}} in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which {{it was not possible to}} accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Attlee {{opposed the}} Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain {{negotiated}} with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland: We all feel relief that war {{has not come}} this time.

We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E
