5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> evidence to indict the men. He said the evidence {{indicated that the}} Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. Since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> room to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E

In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E

5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> line available, runners. The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the affair}} brought such a shock {{that people were}} sobered.

The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price slightly. In the end, most people simply stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E

5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> {{evidence}} {{to conclude that}} Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis {{could not have been}} a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, {{one of which was}} used for council meetings.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine {{reached the}} end of the line at Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> damage below the waterline to confirm {{that she had been}} sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.|$|E

5|$|When {{the city}} {{government}} announced its budget in late June 2014 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1, the ferry only received a $2 million further appropriation, enough to temporarily extend it again through October. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> ridership to justify the cost of operation. Despite last-minute efforts by local transportation advocates, civic leaders, and elected officials, ferry service ended on October 31, 2014. They promised to continue efforts to have the service restored. This led to many negotiations between the mayor's office and the parties interested in reopening the ferry. The mayor's office eventually agreed to restart the Rockaway ferry when the NYC Ferry system opened.|$|E
5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> ridership for them to be interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E
