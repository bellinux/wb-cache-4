5|$|In 1979, {{the first}} statewide {{competition}} was held, and {{just over two}} years later, the newly formed United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California—200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed {{for the chance to}} attend. Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event. At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, {{the first}} Nationals {{was held at}} Loyola Marymount University in California—16 states and the District of Columbia participated. However, the competition's founder, Dr. Robert Peterson, was {{inspired}} by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event, and so at the 1984 Nationals, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand fielded teams in addition to teams from 32 U.S. states. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, {{no more than a few}} teams a year have competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. El Camino Real High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010. The current National Champion is Granada Hills Charter High School from Granada Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

It was Brugmann who pointed out that labiovelars had merged into the velars in the satem group, accounting for the coincidence of the discarded non-labialized group with the satem group.|$|E
25|$|As an example, the Spanish were {{received}} peaceably in Tzintzuntzan by Tangáxuan II, the cazonci of the Tarascan state, which largely {{coincides with the}} modern state of Michoacán. Tangáxuan gave Guzmán presents of gold and silver and supplied him with soldiers and provisions. Nevertheless, Guzmán had him arrested and tortured, {{to get him to}} reveal the location of hidden stores of gold. Presumably <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> gold, because Tangáxuan did not reveal it under torture. Guzmán had him dragged by a horse and then burned alive on February 14, 1530.|$|E

By noon of 2 November, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> Egyptian opposition in the Gaza City area. On 3 November, the IDF attacked Egyptian and Palestinian forces at Khan Yunis. After a fierce battle, the Israeli 37th Armored Brigade's Sherman tanks broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade.|$|E

Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
25|$|In 682, Uqba ibn Nafi reassumed command. He {{defeated}} {{an alliance}} of Berber forces near Tahirt (Algeria), then proceeded westward in military triumph, eventually reaching the Atlantic coast, where he lamented at before him <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> land to conquer for Islam. Episodes from his campaigns became legend throughout the Maghrib. Yet the Berber leader held prisoner, Kusaila, escaped. Later Kusaila led a fresh Berber uprising, which interrupted the conquest and claimed the Arab leader's life. Kusaila then formed an enlarged Berber kingdom. Yet Zuhair b. Qais, the deputy of the fallen Arab leader, enlisted Zanata tribes from Cyrenaica {{to fight for the}} cause of Islam, and in 686 managed to overturn Kusaila's newly formed kingdom.|$|E

25|$|When he {{approached}} Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> {{feeling like a}} métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} tactically indecisive with both leaders keen to seek peace. Following this Manuel's army {{continued}} to skirmish with the Turks in Anatolia, defeating {{them in a}} smaller but indecisive battle in the Meander Valley. Regardless of this small respite, Myriokephalon had far more decisive implications than the casualties would suggest – <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> Byzantine reconquest in Asia Minor after 1176, leaving the process begun by Alexios incomplete at best. For the Seljuqs, the acquisition of Danishmend territory gave them a victory though once again the Seljuqs {{had to contend with}} neighbouring disputes leading to the peace treaty as requested by both leaders. By the terms of the treaty, Manuel was obliged to remove the armies and fortifications posted at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1880s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> prey for {{the wolf}} or other carnivores: all game animals had been shot out of the Black Hills and the Great Plains by hunters. Wolves and other hunting animals were {{themselves}} being hunted into extinction. In 1911, 55 gray wolves were killed in the South Dakota Black Hills, with bounties paid. In 1915, 8 more were killed; in 1916, 5 more. A pregnant wolf and her four pups were killed in 1917, and what was possibly her mate was killed in 1920. Without the buffalo and other game to prey on, wolves had to adapt to changing circumstances; they did so by attacking livestock. Many wolves were simply poisoned with strychnine; others were shot in a large federally funded eradication program, which between 1915 and 1920 employed over 300 hunters, who killed a staggering number of animals: 110,000 coyotes, 15,000 bobcats and lynxes, 3,000 wolves. Counting those killed by poison, the total exceeded 250,000.|$|E

25|$|The Red Army took Vladivostok in October 1922, and the Soviet {{government}} began to consolidate its {{control of the}} Northeast. In early 1923 the Soviets seized four trading schooners at East Cape, Siberia, including one owned by Olaf Swenson & Company (the Blue Sea) and one chartered to Swenson, on charges of trafficking alcohol. (The New York Times article suggested that competition with the Hudson's Bay Company {{could have been a}} factor, since that company's country manager was the brother of the Soviet governor). Swenson does not discuss this seizure or charge specifically. Later that year the Yakut Revolt was suppressed and the last organized White force under Anatoly Pepelyayev was defeated at Ayan (a port village on the Sea of Okhotsk) on June 17, 1923. In October 1923, G.G. Suddock, Agent for Olaf Swenson Co. at Ayan, arriving in Seattle from Ayan by way of Japan, confirmed to a reporter for the Prescott (AZ) Evening Courier that the Bolshevik victory was complete and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> White resistance.|$|E
