500|$|Gloria Stuart as Rose Dawson Calvert: Rose narrates {{the film}} in a modern-day framing device. Cameron stated, [...] "In order to see {{the present and the}} past, I decided to create a fictional {{survivor}} who is [...] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history." [...] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack {{for the first time since}} the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, [...] "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties." [...] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. [...] "But [...] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [...] spirit," [...] stated Cameron. [...] "I saw this joie de vivre in both of <b>them,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person." [...] Stuart died on September 26, 2010, at age 100, approximately the same age elder Rose was in the film.|$|E

2500|$|However, Sadoveanu's {{stories of}} the period often {{returned}} to a naturalistic perspective, particularly {{in a series of}} sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial petite bourgeoisie. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In La noi, la Viișoara ("At Our Place in Viișoara"), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, {{to the point where he}} makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu's positive portrayal of hajduks as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled Bordeenii (roughly, [...] "The Mud-hut Dwellers"), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: [...] "What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I'd have a better time with the cattle; it is with <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have grown up and with <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> get along." [...] Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in Vremuri de bejenie ("Roving Times", 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.|$|E

Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [...] of Christianity.|$|E

2500|$|Glenn Herbert Gould {{was born}} at home in Toronto on September 25, 1932, to Russell Herbert ("Bert") Gold and Florence ("Flora") Emma Gold (née Greig), Presbyterians of Scottish and English ancestry. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a cousin of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (who was himself of Scottish ancestry). The family's surname was changed to Gould informally around 1939 {{in order to avoid}} being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing anti-Semitism of prewar Toronto and the Gold surname's Jewish association. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes made jokes on the subject, like [...] "When people ask me if I'm Jewish, I always tell <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was Jewish during the war." [...] Gould grew up in a home at 32 Southwood Drive, Toronto. His childhood home has been named a historic site by the City of Toronto.|$|E

I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it {{meant so much to}} <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could sing that song and so much to me that I was able to do something.

2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard thing to do to keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E

2500|$|Alan Brennert, {{one of the}} writer-producers {{who contributed}} to the series, wrote that the picture quality of the DVD set was [...] "NOT a 'bad transfer'" [...] but rather that the episodes were [...] "shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then {{transferred}} to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects—everything was done on video. We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this. So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there are NO original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer. All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes, and the unfortunate reality is, videotape does deteriorate some over time. Image has, in my opinion, done a superb job packaging our series, {{and it is to}} <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> award the five stars in this review! If not for their interest in bringing this show to DVD, those one-inch masters might eventually have eroded into so much static (as my 3/4-inch tapes of the show already have)."

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth.

The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, Popović, {{acting as}} the legal {{representative}} of Mila Đinđić and Gordana Đinđić-Filipović, assassinated Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić's mother and sister, respectively, filed a criminal complaint against former Special Operations Unit (JSO) members Milorad Ulemek, Dušan [...] "Gumar" [...] Maričić, Zvezdan Jovanović, Veselin Lečić, Mića Petraković, Dragoslav [...] "Dragan" [...] Krsmanović, and Dragoš Radić, as well as former Yugoslav president Vojislav Koštunica and former Security Administration head Aco Tomić.
