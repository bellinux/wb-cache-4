40|$|This study aims at {{developing}} an experimental tool useful to define accurately the friction coefficients in bolted joints and, therefore, at relating precisely the tightening torque to the bolt preloading force in some special components used in front motorbike suspensions. The components under investigation are some clamped joints made of aluminium alloy. The preloading force {{is achieved by}} applying a torque wrench to the bolt head. Some specific specimens have been appropriately designed and realized in order to study the tribological aspects of the tightening phase. Experimental tests have been performed by applying the Design of Experiment (DOE) method {{in order to obtain}} a mathematical model for the friction coefficients. Three replicas of a full factorial DOE at two levels for each variable have been carried out. The levels include cast versus forged aluminium alloy, anodized versus spray-painted surface, lubricated versus unlubricated screw, and first <b>tightening</b> (fresh unspoiled <b>surfaces)</b> versus sixth <b>tightening</b> (spoiled <b>surfaces).</b> The study considers M 8 x 1. 25 8. 8 galvanized screws...|$|R

40|$|We find layer number {{dependence}} in {{the size}} of metal nanoparticles grown on 1 to 10 layer graphene. Graphene is an attractive substrate for investigating and using nanoparticles due to its loose interaction with them. To preserve this condition it is ideal to grow particles in place rather than deposit them from solution. We find that annealing of evaporated metal nanoparticles on graphene and few layer graphene <b>surfaces</b> <b>tightens</b> their size distribution. The number of graphene layers changes the selected size. These results are in quantitative agreement with a model incorporating surface, bulk, and coulomb free energies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have allowed}} the geometry and kinematics of the M 87 jet to be tightly constrained. We combine these constraints with historical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) results and the theory of synchrotron self-absorbed radio cores in order to investigate the physical properties of the jet. Our results strongly suggest the jet {{to be dominated by}} an electron-positron (pair) plasma. Although our conservative constraints cannot conclusively dismiss an electron-proton plasma, the viability of this solution is extremely vulnerable to further <b>tightening</b> of VLBI <b>surface</b> brightness limits. The arguments presented, coupled with future high-resolution multi-frequency VLBI studies of the jet core, will be able to firmly distinguish these two possibilities. Comment: 8 pages, 1 ps figure.

5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to <b>tighten</b> to <b>surface</b> pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Glossy {{reflections}} from fibers {{exhibit a}} light- and view-dependent lobe <b>tightening</b> similar to <b>surface</b> reflectance that previous analytic fiber models lack (a,c). We derive new non-separable fiber-scattering lobes that exhibit this and additional behaviours seen in ground-truth simulation of rough dielectric fiber scattering. Parameter tweaking of previous models can produce results similar to (d), but no previous model with fixed settings can simultaneously produce both (b) and (d). We found that ground-truth renders using explicit cylindrical geometry with Cook Torrance reflectance to be indistinguishable from (b) and (d) (upon convergence, which required significantly more samples per pixel). The {{difference between the}} old and new models is further illustrated in (e) by visualizing the R lobe of a circular fiber with Beckmann micro roughness and tilted scales (black hair). In the backlit case (c,d) light grazes the edges of fibers and exhibits the brighter more focused response (seen in (e) where the lobe compresses and brightens for high |φ |). Introduction An important feature of physically-based surface re-flectance models is the focusing and increased brightness of glossy lobes at grazing angles. This affect has not been accounted for by previous analytic bidirectional curve scattering distribution func-tions (BCSDFs) that describe the far-field radiometry of fiber re...|$|R
40|$|Chrome plating is {{routinely}} {{being used in}} piston rings in the automobile industry. However, as the emission norms are getting <b>tightened,</b> the working <b>surface</b> temperature of top piston rings needs to be increased. Consequently wear increases and hence the need for better wear resistant coatings on piston rings. We have identified sputter deposited CrN as a suitable replacement for hard chrome for piston rings. CrN coatings were deposited on steel, silicon and other substrates using a reactive DC magnetron sputtering process. As CrN exists in different phases (i. e., cubic-CrN and hexagonal-Cr 2 N), process parameters were optimized to achieve single phase of CrN with varying hardness values. The basic properties of CrN such as: structure, mechanical properties, thermal stability, oxidation resistance and corrosion behavior have been studied in detail using X-ray diffraction, nanoindentation, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, micro-Raman spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization, etc. For a comparison, we have also evaluated the properties of TiN coatings. Cubic-CrN coatings with different thicknesses (about 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6 and 10 m) have also been deposited on various steel samples for wear measurements. We {{are in a position}} to deposit CrN coatings with a maximum thickness of approximately 10 m on steel substrates in the existing planar magnetron sputtering system. New sputtering facility has also been developed to coat full piston rings. ...|$|R
40|$|Development of high {{precision}} machine tools enables {{the industry to}} continuously <b>tighten</b> tolerances and <b>surface</b> finish quality demands. Controlling the thermal state of the machine and process has become the dominant challenge for machine tool manufacturers. Defining models that predict the thermally induced deformations is {{an important aspect of}} this development. This research project focussed on development of a thermomechanical model of a hydrostatic machine tool spindle. Analytical calculations are performed to describe the viscous dissipation in the bearing fluid, losses in the integrated electric motor, the motor coolant circuit and ambient conditions. The resulting parameters and equations are supplied to a finite element model of the spindle assembly. An important characteristic of the model is a fully parametric set-up to enable easy investigation of design variations. A new modelling method is proposed to address the demand for a parametric finite element model of this complexity. This involves a generalised definitions structure that allows the user to rebuild a model with a single function call. The approach helps eliminate artefacts and provides a platform to store corresponding definitions and simulation results. Validation of the theoretical model is performed with two series of thermal error measurements on industrial machine tool spindles. The design of the spindles is modified to incorporate internal temperature sensors which provide important insight in the thermal state of the spindle assembly. Comparison of the simulated and experimental results shows that the model is a promising tool for evaluation of the transient thermal behaviour.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{atmospheric}} storm tracks by ocean dynamics, orography, and their interaction is investigated using idealized experiments with a simplified coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model. The study {{focuses on the}} quasi-steady state for the storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere winter mean. The experiments start with a background state without mountains and ocean dynamics, and in separate stages include orography and a dynamic ocean to obtain a more realistic control simulation. The separate effects of ocean dynamics, orography, and their nonlinear interaction are identified for the storm tracks and the surface thermodynamic forcing over the ocean. The model study suggests that atmospheric storm tracks are a robust feature of the climate system, occurring at midlatitudes {{even if there is}} no orographic forcing or ocean heat transport. Ocean dynamics generally lead to a poleward shift in both the storm track and the maximum in atmospheric northward heat transport and induce a northeastward tilt over the Atlantic. This poleward shift is linked to the extra heat transport by the ocean and the <b>tightening</b> of sea <b>surface</b> temperature gradients on the western side of ocean basins. Orographic forcing causes along-track variability with a weakening of the storm track over the continents and induces a northeastward tilt over the western Pacific, which is associated with a stationary planetary wave train generated by the Tibetan Plateau. The interaction between ocean dynamics and orographic forcing plays a localized role, enhancing the contrast between the Atlantic and Pacific. Much of the response to the forcing is eddy mediated and transient eddies help to spread the influence of orographic and ocean forcing. ...|$|R
