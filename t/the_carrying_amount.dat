In most cases the method is [...] "straight line," [...] with the same depreciation charge from the date when an asset is brought into use until it is expected to be sold or no further economic benefits obtained from it, but other patterns of depreciation are used if assets are used proportionately more in some periods than others (IAS16.56).|$|E

40|$|The SAICA {{recently}} issued Circular 1 / 2006, Disclosures {{in relation}} to deferred tax. The purpose of this Circular is to provide guidance on additional disclosures required for deferred tax where the expected manner of recovery of <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset could materially influence the deferred tax balance. However, {{the contents of the}} Circular is likely to raise a fresh debate amongst preparers and auditors of financial statements around some of the measurement issues resulting from paragraph 51. The interpretation of paragraph 51 is discussed, the application thereof to various types of assets is examined, as well as the application of the Circular. The meaning of the phrase "recovery of <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset" is explored. This is done, firstly, by considering the meaning of the "carrying amount" of an asset and, secondly, by considering the potential manners in which <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of an asset can be "recovered". The application of these principles is then considered for revalued property, plant and equipment. Finally, the requirements of the Circular are highlighted...|$|E

The appropriate rate {{to be used to}} measure deferred tax is not an accounting policy choice. The rate should be determined based on the expected manner of recovery of <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset. Secondly, the 14. 5 % rate is only appropriate, in the case of buildings, if it is expected that <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the asset will be recovered through sale, and then only to fair value adjustments above the CGT valuation date value of the asset...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) on an impairment test of goodwill. While IAS 12. 66 acknowledges that DTLs arising in a business combination influence the amount of goodwill an entity recognises, International Financial Reporting Standards are silent on {{the implications of this}} rule, in particular that DTLs trigger a ‘day one’ impairment of goodwill. To avoid this impairment charge, the professional literature suggests deducting DTLs from <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of the cash generating unit. This method appears contentious conceptually and is unable to shield the entity from an impairment in subsequent periods. The article discusses four proposed solutions to the problem, but recommends a conceptual re-think of the mechanical recognition of deferred taxes in a business combination...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{determinants}} of goodwill impairment decisions and their disclosure quality. Under IAS 36 goodwill {{is subject to}} an annual impairment test in which <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> of goodwill {{is not allowed to}} exceed the recoverable amount. However, valuing this recoverable amount is subject to substantial managerial discretion. Therefore, we predict that ownership concentration, corporate governance quality and firm performance provide incentives for managers to engage in goodwill impairment or not, and thus determine financial reporting quality. We construct a sample of firms that should engage in goodwill impairment. Our results convey that better performing firms and firms with stronger corporate governance mechanisms are more likely to impair. Further, ownership structure and governance have a weak impact on the degree of impairment disclosure. representation, elections, Parliament, self-employed, employers’organisations...|$|E

The U-Shaped {{layout and}} {{function}} of production system is studied, the purpose is showing how the layouts and their main function influence each other, thus to provide enlightenments and references to improve {{the design of the}} production system layout. The simple automatic arrangement system is presented based on Plant Simulation software and focused on an equipment layout problem. The automatic layout system is an automatic layout system of workshop layout according to data; adopt the method of simulation modeling combined with optimization of the workshop layout. According to the different optimization objectives, the user can get a different optimal solution.

Also, the rule specifies that a business case should include (lessen) a loss of value and should provide information on assets that have depreciated. There may be situations in which external influences or changes in production methods within the entity led to decreased value of an asset far more than is acknowledged in annual depreciation costs. In this case, {{it is said that}} the asset is impaired. Impairment, recoverable amount, value in use...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 121 {{is a new}} {{standard}} devoted {{to the issue of}} impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment loss occurs when <b>the</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>amount</b> is not expected to be recovered. When SFAS 121 was issued, early adoption was suggested but not required for fiscal years beginning before December 15, 1995. Although there are some similarities, the standard sets some different rules for assets "to be held and used" and assets "to be disposed of" Since the standard does not identify a materiality level, it remains at the discretion of management. This paper first discusses the requirements of SFAS 121. Then a sample of companies is analyzed to determine compliance with the {{new standard}}. A sample of 25 companies was chosen from the CD-ROM Disclosure Software. The sample was analyzed and compared on a list of items to identify relationship between the items and to identify if, how and when companies plan to comply with SFAS 121. Some of the items noted were year ends, early adoption of SFAS 121, type of impairment, discussion in the management representation letter and discussion in the footnotes to the financial statements.
