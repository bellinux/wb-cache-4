An early but serious sign of CNS oxygen toxicity is a grand-mal seizure, {{also known as a}} generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure consists of a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. Signs and symptoms of oxygen toxicity are usually prevalent, but there are no standard warning signs that a seizure is about to ensue. The convulsion caused by oxygen toxicity does not lead to hypoxia, a side effect common to most seizures, because the body has an excess amount of oxygen when the convulsion begins. The seizures can lead to drowning, however, if the convulsion is suffered by a diver still in the water.|$|E
5000|$|APLHGR, {{being an}} average of the Linear Heat Generation Rate (LHGR), {{a measure of the}} decay heat present in the fuel bundles, is a margin of safety {{associated}} with the potential for fuel failure to occur during a LBLOCA (large-break loss-of-coolant accident - a massive pipe rupture leading to catastrophic loss of coolant pressure within the reactor, considered the most threatening [...] "design basis accident" [...] in probabilistic risk assessment and nuclear safety), which is anticipated to lead to the <b>temporary</b> <b>exposure</b> of the core; this core drying-out event is termed core [...] "uncovery", for the core loses its heat-removing cover of coolant, {{in the case of a}} BWR, light water. If the core is uncovered for too long, fuel failure can occur; for the purpose of design, fuel failure is assumed to occur when the temperature of the uncovered fuel reaches a critical temperature (1100 °C, 2200 °F). BWR designs incorporate failsafe protection systems to rapidly cool and make safe the uncovered fuel prior to it reaching this temperature; these failsafe systems are known as the Emergency Core Cooling System. The ECCS is designed to rapidly flood the reactor pressure vessel, spray water on the core itself, and sufficiently cool the reactor fuel in this event. However, like any system, the ECCS has limits, in this case, to its cooling capacity, and there is a possibility that fuel could be designed that produces so much decay heat that the ECCS would be overwhelmed and could not cool it down successfully.|$|E

40|$|I {{model the}} effect of rapid stellar {{rotation}} on a planet's insolation. Fast-rotating stars have induced pole-to-equator temperature gradients (known as gravity-darkening) of up to several thousand Kelvin that affect the star's luminosity and peak emission wavelength {{as a function of}} latitude. When orbiting such a star, a planet's annual insolation can strongly vary depending on its orbit inclination. Specifically, inclined orbits result in <b>temporary</b> <b>exposure</b> to the star's hotter poles. I find that gravity-darkening can drive changes in a planet's equilibrium temperature of up to ∼ 15 % due to increased irradiance near the stellar poles.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{mechanisms by}} which <b>temporary</b> <b>exposure</b> to developmental signals instigates adipocyte differentiation are unknown. During early adipogenesis, we find transient enrichment of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ), p 300, mediator subunit 1, and histone H 3 acetylation near genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and differentiation, including the gene encoding the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 2 (PPARγ 2). Occupancy and enhancer function are triggered by adipogenic signals, and diminish upon their removal. GR, which is important for adipogenesis but need not be active in the mature adipocyte, functions transiently with other enhancer proteins to propagate a new program of gene expression that includes induction of PPARγ 2, thereby providing a memory of the earlier adipogenic signal. Thus, the conversion of preadipocyte to adipocyte involves {{the formation of an}} epigenomic transition state that is not observed in cells at the beginning or end of the differentiation process...|$|E

The full acid response to histamine after <b>temporary</b> <b>exposure</b> of the cells to the benzimidazoles could be restored by washing the cells twice; this suggests that the inhibition is reversible. The data - among others - indicate that the properties of the benzimidazoles described here would allow these compounds to be used as effective antisecretagogues...|$|E
