25|$|Renames {{are handled}} implicitly rather than explicitly. A common {{complaint}} with CVS {{is that it}} uses {{the name of a}} file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an inode number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage. Source code files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed, and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot. to show code moved between source files (Briefly, given a file in revision N, a file of the same name in revision N−1 is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision N−1, Git searches for a file that existed only in revision N−1 and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more CPU-intensive work every <b>time</b> <b>history</b> is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file {{and the creation of a}} new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and changes separately.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism {{associates}} this commandment {{with the}} three theological virtues. The first virtue, faith, instructs Catholics to believe in God and avoid heresy, apostasy, and schism. The second virtue, hope, cautions Catholics against despair and presumption. According to the Catechism, the last virtue, charity, can be met only if Catholics refrain from indifference or ingratitude toward God, and avoid spiritual laziness and a hatred of God stemming from pride. The Catechism enumerates specific violations of this commandment, including superstition, polytheism, sacrilege, atheism, and all practices of magic and sorcery. It further prohibits astrology, palm reading, and consulting horoscopes or mediums. The Catechism attributes the latter actions to a [...] "desire for power over <b>time,</b> <b>history,</b> {{and in the last}} analysis, other human beings as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers".|$|E

40|$|In performance-based seismic design, ground-motion <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> {{are needed}} for {{analyzing}} dynamic responses of nonlinear structural systems.

The selected <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> are representatives of the regional seismic hazard and should be beneficial to earthquake studies when comprehensive seismic hazard assessments and site investigations are unavailable.

[...] Thus far they have succeeded in seeing Grade II listing applied by English Heritage to six buildings on the estate including St. Mark's Church. [...] The conservation of the estate has been spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society; claiming that the overall layout and planning of the estate is key to its uniqueness and that just keeping six buildings and surrounding them with new houses does not suffice. [...] Despite the Twentieth Century Society campaigning for the entire estate to be made a conservation area and English Heritage recommending 21 buildings be listed, the Department for Culture would {{only go so far}} as to list six of the buildings. [...] Under listing guidelines for twentieth-century buildings, only buildings with few moderations should be listed; in the case of Excalibur, most buildings have modified windows and doors.

2500|$|Nietzsche {{asserted}} that the psychological reality of redemption was [...] "... new way of life, not a new faith." [...] It is [...] "...he deep instinct for how one must live, in order to feel oneself 'in heaven'...." [...] The Christian is known by his acts. He offers no resistance to evil, He has no anger and wants no revenge. Blessedness is not promised on conditions, as in Judaism. The Gospel's glad tidings are {{that there is no}} distinction between God and man. There is no Judaic concern for sin, prayers, rituals, forgiveness, repentance, guilt, punishment, or faith. [...] "vangelic practice alone leads to God, it is God!" [...] "t is only in the practice of life that one feels 'divine,' 'blessed,' 'evangelical,' at all times a 'child of God.'" [...] There were two worlds for the teacher of the Gospel's glad tidings. The real, true world is an inner experience of the heart in which all things are blessedly transfigured (Verklärung), eternalized, and perfected. The apparent world, however, is only a collection of psychological symbols, signs, and metaphors. These symbols are expressed in terms of space, <b>time,</b> <b>history,</b> and nature. Examples of these mere symbols are the concepts of [...] "God as a person", [...] "the son of man", [...] "the hour of death", and [...] "the kingdom of heaven". Jesus did not want to redeem anyone.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{seismology}} is to understand the behaviour of the earth’s movements during the occurrence of an earthquake. This research focuses on the recovery of better estimation of the true ground displacements as the tilt components are inherent in recorded acceleration <b>time</b> <b>histories.</b> The raw acceleration <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> recorded in seismograms of the near field earthquake are contaminated by the effects of tilt <b>time</b> <b>histories.</b> The effects of tilt <b>time</b> <b>histories</b> cause non–zero baseline errors in seismic records thereby providing offset in the ground velocity although the final velocity never ends to zero and ground displacement diverges from the constant value. To perform baseline corrections it is therefore necessary to remove the tilt and noise components. Tilt separation was undertaken using a model designated the Tilt Separation – Independent Component Analysis (TS-ICA) model, and an enhanced version of the Extended Generalised Beta Distribution (EGBD) model. Several source distributions such as Normal, Gaussian, Non-Gaussian, Sub and Super Gaussian and skewed distribution with zero kurtosis has been modelled using EGBD and separated using EGBD-ICA.
