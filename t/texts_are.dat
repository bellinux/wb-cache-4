5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid <b>Texts</b> <b>are</b> the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid <b>Texts</b> <b>are</b> chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing {{the soul of the}} sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Hindu natal astrology {{originated}} with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's <b>texts</b> <b>are</b> considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology.

5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major source of information. Some of these <b>texts</b> <b>are</b> found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV.
