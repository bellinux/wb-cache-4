40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study on}} sandwich panels for slab applications looking at expanded polystyrene core sandwich panels with various materials for the face. The aim {{is to determine the}} optimum thickness for strength and serviceability of a number of sandwich panels. Finite element analysis using Strand 7 and the construction and <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>samples</b> were carried out to verify the accuracy of a numerical study. Four panels were constructed using plywood, oriented strand board, aluminium and steel as the face material and were tested in a SANS material testing machine which measured applied loading and mid-span deflection. These same panels were modelled using finite element analysis in the Strand 7 software package under the same conditions as the laboratory tests. The results were compared and found to be in good agreement between them which confirmed the validity of the computer model. Further study was undertaken using Strand 7 to model the same panels with the application of domestic floor loading as per AS 1170. Three formulas to calculate the optimum core thickness with respect to the panel failure mode were tested however were found to be unsuitable for the loading arrangement of a uniformly distributed load and a concentrated load. An iterative approach to determining the optimum core thickness was then used. Modelling various thicknesses of the same span panel allowed the optimum core thickness to be determined for that span that would allow the panel to only deflect a maximum of Span/ 400 or 10 mm. This process was repeated until a span/thickness curve was created that allows the optimum thickness core to be read from the chart for panel spans up to 6 metres. This research project shows that sandwich panel can be used for slab applications under domestic floor loading. The validity of the Strand 7 model has been shown be comparing physical test results to the computer model. By developing span/thickness charts to optimise the core thickness of the panels allows a panel system to be manufactured that will minimise weight and cost while still satisfying strength and serviceability requirements. ...|$|E

Nuclear {{borehole logging}} techniques have advantages and disadvantages that tend to be complementary to those <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sampling</b> and these in situ measurements can help address the drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>sampling,</b> including high costs, lengthy delays in obtaining results of analyses from laboratories/under sampling, sample handling problems, and ambiguity in long-term monitoring.

40|$|Objective: A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} in order to establish whether AS patients, who are defined as non-responders after 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, show improvement on performance-based <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> functioning. Methods: At baseline and 3 months after the start of anti-TNF therapy, AS patients completed seven performance-based <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> functioning, questionnaires on self-reported physical functioning (BASFI) and disease activity (BASDAI), and a pain and a global patient assessment. The concordance between ≥ 20 % intra-individual improvement on the performance-based <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> functioning and (i) response to anti-TNF therapy [Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 20 % (ASAS 20) response] and (ii) ≥ 20 % intra-individual improvement on self-reported physical functioning (BASFI) was assessed. Results: One hundred AS patients were included, of which 82 patients completed all tests at both time points. After 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, 27 (32. 9 %) patients were categorized as non-responders according to the ASAS 20 response criteria. Improvement in performance-based physical functioning was seen in 13 of the 27 non-responders (48. 1 %) (i. e. n = 13 / 82 = 15. 9 % of the total group). Furthermore, 30 (36. 6 %) patients showed no improvement on self-reported physical functioning (BASFI). However, 17 of the 30 (56. 7 %) patients did improve on the performance-based <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> functioning (i. e. n = 17 / 82 = 20. 7 % of the total group). Conclusion: After 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, performance-based <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> functioning showed improvement in 48. 1 % of the ASAS 20 non-responders. With these performance-based tests, new information on outcome after anti-TNF therapy can be generated. Using performance-based tests alongside the BASFI could have additional value in the evaluation of outcomes for patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. © The Author 2013.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the frequency of police officers’ training and use of arresting techniques and to investigate police officers’ attitudes to annual <b>physical</b> <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> skills and arresting techniques. The study also examines the officers’ assessment <b>of</b> their own <b>physical</b> skills. The results show that most of the police officers rarely use arresting techniques during police work, and only train arresting techniques two to five times a year. It is argued that this is insufficient to maintain and develop adequate skills. However, the results also show that the police officers are in general positive to annual <b>physical</b> <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> skills and arresting techniques – a strategy that may increase the training frequency.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 1975. In {{recent years}} the area <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> fitness has been of special interest. In a number of {{countries}} national fitness programmes have been launched to increase the awareness of the importance <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> fitness at all levels. Literature on the <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> fitness abounds, particularly in the United States of America. Several books on tests and measurements in physical education are available, and these provide invaluable guidelines to teachers <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> education in the important aspects of evaluating and assessing the physical fitness and progress of pupils. Howeyer, in South Africa, research in this important area is limited, especially in so far as Indian pupils arc concerned. In the present study an attempt is made to establish norms on selected <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> fitness for Indian girls. The study is divided into five parts as follows: CHAPTER ONE presents the rationale for the establishment of norms for Indian girls in South Africa.
