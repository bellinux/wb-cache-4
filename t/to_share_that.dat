25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
25|$|Whenever {{the laptop}} is powered on it can {{participate}} in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud {{has access to the}} Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers in the cloud are able <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.|$|E
500|$|To {{relieve the}} 55th Infantry Division, the French 71st Infantry Division was ordered out of reserve {{and into the}} frontline. The {{presence}} of the 71st Infantry shortened the front from [...] along the Meuse. This would increase the density of fighting strength in the immediate area, but such a move was only partially complete by 10 May, as it {{was scheduled to be}} completed on 13–14 May, three days after the German attack. Although the two divisions had 174 artillery pieces, more than the German forces opposing them, they had <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> force between them. Both divisions were short of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns, a critical short-coming.|$|E

500|$|Finally, the Lithuanian side {{considered}} the Żeligowski's attack on Vilnius {{a violation of}} the Suwałki agreement and as a major argument in international mediation. Poland disagreed and protested such interpretation of the document. At first Poland claimed that Żeligowski was a rebel who acted without approval from the Polish government. Later Piłsudski's role in the attack was acknowledged, but the Polish side argued that the agreement was not violated, as the attack was held to the east from the demarcation line. The League of Nations {{considered the}} Polish attack {{a violation of the}} agreement, but placed emphasis on resumption of the hostilities and not subsequent territorial changes. Senn said the view that the agreement has not been violated was [...] "specious". In his opinion, Piłsudski himself did not seem <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> view, as evidenced by his attempt to pretend that the attacking forces were [...] "rebels".|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E

In early 2002, Entwistle finished what was his last drawing. [...] "Eyes Wide Shut" [...] represented a new style for Entwistle. Featuring Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton, Entwistle's style had evolved from simple line drawings and caricatures to a more lifelike representation of his subjects. He was more confident and relaxed with his art and ready <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> with his collectors.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2008, Benefis was {{considered}} the [...] "sole community provider" [...] by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, {{which resulted in a}} $1.5 million annual federal payment to the health system. If total hospital admissions at any other healthcare facility in the community rises above 8 percent, Benefis would be required <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> payment equally with the other provider(s). The same year, Benefis said Medicare patients accounted for 48 percent of the health system's admissions, but contributed only 40 percent of its revenues. Patients with private insurance represented 26 percent of admissions but accounted for 40 percent of revenues. Benefis said that it lost money on its dialysis, emergency room, and inpatient mental health services.|$|E

After two sessions in which she declined <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> information, she was again called into her supervisor's office and told she was not cooperating and needed to [...] "talk this out". She told the therapist she was getting a lawyer, after which further sessions were canceled as a [...] "mistake".|$|E

2500|$|The title 10,000 Days {{refers to}} roughly the orbital {{period of the}} planet Saturn (actual time period is 10,759 days), which adds up to nearly 29 years and marks, {{according}} to Keenan, [...] "the time when you are presented the opportunity to transform from whatever your hang-ups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load, so to speak, and let go of old patterns and embrace a new life." [...] Keenan expected that the songs composed would [...] "chronicle that process, hoping that my gift back would be <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> path and hope that I could help somebody get past that spot." [...] It is rumoured that the album is a reference to Maynard James Keenan's mother who was paralyzed for 10,000 days (27 years) before she died.|$|E

There’s a whole bunch of reasons why it’s complicated, which are boring so I won’t go into, but there’s a possibility," [...] also adding: [...] "It’s more likely to be 28 Months than 28 Years. 28 months gives you one more place to go," [...] hinting at the possibility of a fourth film as well.|$|E

Lennon said, [...] "It's a company we're setting up, involving records, films, and electronics, and – as a sideline – manufacturing or whatever. We want to set up a system where people who just want to make a film about anything, don't have to go on their knees in somebody's office, probably yours". McCartney also said: [...] "It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment. We're in the happy position of not needing any more money. So for the first time, the bosses aren't in it for profit. We've already bought all our dreams. We want <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> possibility with others".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the manuscript written by Clum, Boyer {{said he had a}} copy of a manuscript that Josephine prepared with the help of two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. Wyatts' cousins pressed her for details about her personal life before and while living in Tombstone, but she was evasive. Josephine wanted to keep her and Wyatt Earp's tarnished history associated with Tombstone private and sanitize anything that could be seen negatively. [...] She finally consented <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> upon returning to Arizona, she believed Johnny Behan was going to marry her, and was disappointed and disillusioned when he repeatedly delayed the wedding. In her version of events, she said years later that she lived with a lawyer while working as a housekeeper for Behan and his ten-year-old son, Albert. Boyer argues that she actually lived with Behan. Boyer warns readers of [...] "her ‘little-old-lady’ attempts to tell only the decorous and proper." [...] Interviewers said she was often [...] "difficult" [...] to interview.|$|E
2500|$|In 1850 Campana {{had gone}} to Paris, armed with a letter of {{recommendation}} from Rossini to seek a position at the Théâtre des Italiens which {{at that time was}} run by Benjamin Lumley. He was unsuccessful, however, and returned to Italy. Then on the suggestion of Lord Ward, a principal benefactor of Her Majesty's Theatre, he went to London where he was to live {{for the rest of his}} life. There he opened a famous singing school, conducted concerts, and continued his reputation as a prolific and popular composer of art songs. The first of his [...] "Grand Matinee Musicale" [...] concerts took place in 1854 under the patronage of Lord Ward, and featured his latest compositions. The 1860s saw the premieres of his last two operas. Almina premiered in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 26 April 1860 conducted by Luigi Arditi with Marietta Piccolomini in the title role. The critical reaction was tepid.

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 12 {{million people}} fled or were {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union and non-German-speaking Central Europe, many of them being 'Volksdeutsche'. Most left the Soviet-occupied territories of Central and Eastern Europe; they comprised the largest migration of any European people in modern history. [...] The then three Allies had agreed to the expulsions during negotiations {{in the midst of}} war. The western powers hoped to avoid ethnic Germans being an issue again in Central and Eastern Europe. The three Allies at the Conference of Potsdam considered the [...] "transfer" [...] of [...] "German populations" [...] from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary an effort to be undertaken (see article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement), although they asked a halt because of the inflicted burden for the Allies to feed and house the destitute expellees and <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> burden among the Allies. France, which was not represented in Potsdam, rejected the decision of the Three of Potsdam and did not absorb expellees in its zone of occupation. The three Allies had to accept the reality on the ground, since expulsions of Volksdeutsche and Central and Eastern European nationals of German or alleged German ethnicity who never had enrolled as Volksdeutsche, was going on already.|$|E

2500|$|Many times, Luthor {{has stated}} {{that he could have}} aided the entire human race if not for Superman's interference, {{claiming}} that he gives humanity a goal that they could realistically strive to duplicate, while Superman makes them reach for the impossible. Both Superman and Conner Kent have called him out on the hypocrisy of this statement, noting that he has regularly turned down easy opportunities to willingly help others, simply because he would have sacrificed an opportunity to kill Superman by doing so. They believe this shows that Luthor's ego is more important to him than humanity. Even when Superman was depowered after the Battle of Metropolis and remained out of sight for a year, the only thing Luthor accomplished in that time was the self-sabotaged 'Everyman' project, subsequently finding a long-buried Kryptonian warship which he uses to attack Metropolis. This prompted Superman to note that he spent his year without Superman to discover [...] "a big destructive machine so [...] could break things" [...] rather than achieve anything of worth to humanity, all the while claiming that Superman drove him to it. This idea of Luthor's fixation on his hatred for Superman was further reinforced when Luthor was briefly merged with a near-omnipotent entity that sought peace after its difficult 'childhood'. While merged with the entity, Luthor had the power to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe, potentially becoming a hero greater even than Superman, but Luthor fought against that power simply because he would have had <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>that</b> bliss with Superman as well.|$|E
