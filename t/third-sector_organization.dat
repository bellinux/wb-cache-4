The ‘modernization’ of British public services seeks to broaden public sector governance networks, bringing the views of third sector organizations, the public and service users (among others) to the design, management and delivery of welfare. Building on previous analyses of the contradictions generated by these roles, this paper draws on longitudinal qualitative research to enunciate the challenges faced by one <b>third-sector</b> <b>organization</b> in facilitating service user influence in a UK National Health Service (NHS) pilot programme, alongside other roles in tension with this advocacy function. The analysis highlights limits in the extent to which lateral governance networks pluralize stakeholder involvement. The ‘framing’ of governance may mean that traditional concerns outweigh the views of new stakeholders such as the third sector and service users. Rather than prioritizing wider stakeholders' views in the design and delivery of public services, placing third sector organizations at the centre of governance networks may do more to co-opt these organizations in reproducing predominant priorities...|$|E

" This study concentrates on how this organization, that I call Food Rights, has built a broad multi-sector network {{made up of a}} varied set of constituents and collaborators aiming to develop and promote an alternative food system for New York City (NYC). This network model has allowed Food Rights to leverage capacity in order to reach thousands of New Yorkers who participate in many different aspects of the local food system (LFS) that correspond to its programming. These include Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), urban agriculture, emergency food, policy and advocacy efforts, and community food education. This dissertation explores the ways that Food Rights navigates the contested space of civil society and the third-sector realm through its LFS efforts [...] a geography where Food Rights constituents feel they have a say in how local food is grown, distributed, purchased, and prepared. It also considers the complex challenges presented by the burgeoning LFS movement in NYC. This study reveals weak contact points in Food Rights network design as well as organizational strengths that could assist it and other LFS-focused NGOs in addressing the many challenges associated with the social changes that have lead to the spatial, ideological, and material shifts that are transforming the NYC landscape into "a new ontology of food. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} my last year’s {{presentation}} were communication (ethical, integration, political) threats posed by a foundation {{seen as an}} extension to a company in its traditional sense. I {{came to the conclusion}} that an automatic transfer of social trust capital to the parent company (in certain, specified by me, contexts) causes the foundation to betray its mission. It is the company that becomes the main beneficiary of mutual aid activities. This year, the paper addresses the following three issues. Firstly, I intend to show the symbolic pressure exerted on both consumers and producers, which is made possible by the ‘labeling’ of products of ‘socially sensitive’ companies. There would be no point questioning the fact of shaping social attitudes if it weren’t for an ambiguous position of the co-ordinator of the enterprise, who becomes vested with the rights of a certification authority. Another question under consideration is the transformation of a foundation into a quasi-company. A <b>third-sector</b> <b>organization</b> adds business activity to the goals specified in its by-laws. It results in taking on highly-skilled professionals who have nothing to do with charitable activity of a third sector organization. Finally, there is a danger of a foundation’s approximation to a second-sector organization. A foundation may be financed by a public administration body. This may lead to the division of the final product of a foundation between the beneficiaries and the body which sponsors its operation using a ‘lump sum’ payment. Whichever the problem, the key aspect seems societal control over mutual aid activities. Its lack results in an abuse of power and the diminished trust of the manipulated society in effective cooperation...|$|E

The present bachelor thesis “Estonian third-sector organizations´ public relations: Sustainable Renovation Information Center example” gives overview about the public relations in Estonian non-profit organizations and foundations. The mutual relations of organization and its stakeholders are described in depth on the sample organization (Sustainable Renovation Information Centre). The theoretical part of the thesis is based on the stakeholders approach. The third-sector approaches are also being introduced. According to the stakeholders approach organization has to understand the world of stakeholders and plan its actions accordingly, otherwise the organization cannot be successful. In order to get the answers to the research questions the questionnaire was implemented among the Estonian <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations.</b> Additionally, qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried through with the members of Sustainable Renovation Information Centre and with the representatives from the stakeholders. The main finding of the thesis is that public relations in Estonian <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> is generally insufficient. On the basis of research findings the model was formulated for describing the relations between Estonian <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> and their stakeholders. Public relations are usually managed by CEO. Different means of communications are used as a channel for public relations.

40|$|While Japan {{has taken}} liberal steps in {{reforming}} its big government welfare state, {{there has been}} a significant rise in the type of civil activities geared toward problem solving within Japanese society. However, in order to envision new relationships—i. e., the demarcation of roles and cooperation—between and among the government, corporate, and third sectors as an extension of these developments, it is necessary to define the overall picture of the third sector that embraces various types of entities—public corporations, specified nonprofit organizations, cooperative associations, social enterprises, and so forth—and to understand the status of their management. Public corporations, which altogether form a very complex portfolio of organizations today, have proliferated and diverged over the years under the now-defunct shumu kancho (competent ministry) system that allowed for the formation of public corporations at the discretion of the respective competent government ministries. This paper discusses how Japan should define its third sector, using as a reference the American approach (of defining the third sector as a nonprofit sector) and the European approach (of defining the third sector as a group of social economy organizations). We conducted a questionnaire survey, based upon which to examine the organizational characteristics and management of <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> in Japan, and this paper presents some ideas derived from the survey findings. Key findings are as follows: (1) Japanese <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> have a fairly organized and solid management system, (2) there remain considerable problems regarding transparency, (3) the conventional image of third sector organizations as being extremely dependent on the government should be reexamined because only 29. 5 % of their income is generated by public funds and the breakdown of income by nature shows that voluntarily-offered funds ("voluntary income") account for only 22. 3 % with the remaining 77. 8 % coming from their operations ("earned income"), and (4) 30 % to 50 % of the <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> seek to grow and develop by boosting their income. ...|$|R

This thesis locates one example of participation within wider debates about the constitution of contemporary society, changing welfare-state governance, and the challenges of operationalizing such initiatives. It relates the particularities of this case to practical, policy and theoretical questions. The thesis begins by considering the rise of participation in historical context, relating its aims to social-theoretical commentaries on late-modern society. This framework informs an examination of rationales for participation, an analysis of policy discourses on public involvement in health, and consideration of the challenges of making participation happen. The remainder of the thesis {{presents the results of}} an empirical study of one example of participation: service-user involvement in a programme of pilot cancer-genetics services, managed by the <b>third-sector</b> <b>organization</b> Macmillan Cancer Support. Using interview, observational and documentary data collected over a three-year period, it offers a longitudinal perspective on the practice of involvement, drawing on various actors’ perspectives. Considered over five empirical chapters are competing rationales for involvement put forward by different groups of actors, the micro-processes of involvement, and the varied outcomes of negotiations across the seven pilots studied. In reconciling the theoretical and policy literatures with empirical findings, the thesis highlights certain tensions. Policy-level ambiguities permit the coexistence of multiple discourses about the purpose of involvement, the identity of those involved, and the influence it should command, resulting in conflict as {{participation is}} put into practice. Policies designed to avoid directiveness and facilitate local discretion create dilemmas for those charged with implementation, especially third-sector organizations whose intermediary role means they must reconcile divergent views of diverse stakeholders in participation practice. The result is a situation where pragmatic negotiations take precedence over any theoretical or normative vision for participation in determining its remit, scope and influence...|$|E

In many ways, service design has become a responsive reformulation of practices from different fields.

40|$|Scholars {{studying}} {{policy implementation}} in traditional hierarchical organizations {{have long been}} interested in the impact of redundancy on program performance. Specifically, they have asked if a duplication of effort among agencies performing similar or competitive functions is justified by an improvement {{in the quality of}} programmatic outcomes. Early work in this area suggested that redundancy increases program effectiveness by reducing the errors and omissions that might occur in single agency production. More recent work has been less sanguine, suggesting that redundancy may actually decrease performance as all agencies gravitate toward the standards of the least effective, or that the increased costs of redundancy are only justified by improved performance under a relatively limited set of circumstances. During the same period that scholars have been debating the impact of redundancy in traditional policy implementation, we have learned that fewer and fewer programs are actually implemented within such structures. Research now suggests that many (most?) public programs and services are delivered through collaborative or networked arrangements between government, private, and <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations,</b> rather than through singular (or redundant) hierarchical government agencies.

It requires profound changes in the ways in which societies are organized, and has held out the promise of heroic change. Although community development practitioners have been able to secure spaces for community development processes and policies, overall the successes of community development have been uneven and often quite modest. Indeed, the story of community development so far is one of the considerable unfinished businesses.

40|$|Background: Domestic {{violence}} and abuse (DVA), defined as threatening behavior or abuse by {{adults who are}} intimate partners or family members, is a key public health and clinical priority. The prevalence of DVA in the United Kingdom and worldwide is high, {{and its impact on}} physical and mental health is detrimental and persistent. There is currently little support within healthcare settings for women experiencing DVA.

40|$|The article {{presents}} some {{results from a}} multi-year research project on immigrant associations {{in the province of}} Milan, Italy. This subject of analysis was selected for two different reasons: firstly the conviction that immigrant associations can {{play a crucial role in}} the integration of immigrants into the host society; secondly the realization that this phenomenon has to date been little studied, at least as far as Italy is concerned. The analysis yields numerous issues for reflection and recurrent features of particular significance. The first is the fact that, for all the associations surveyed, their main goal and the essential reason for their existence was the desire to integrate their community of membership into the host society. However, such integration did not consist in a desire to be assimilated into Italian society, quite the opposite: the majority of the associations studied were wholly committed to maintaining – and sometimes rediscovering – the identity and culture of their reference community. Moreover, a very large proportion of the immigrants belonging to the associations intended to return to their homelands; and it was for the benefit of those homelands that many of the associations directed their activities. The second main feature is that immigrant associations are crucial nodes in a dense network of relations involving numerous actors of very different kinds: the immigrants themselves, other immigrant associations, <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations,</b> and the local authorities. The third and final important issue concerns the representativeness of immigrant associations: whether, that is, they can be considered the legitimate representatives of the community of membership...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the emergence of new, multi-stakeholder co-operatives in China and identify their resource mix structure, as well as the influence of institutional environments. The empirical observations are related to a conceptual rationale of social enterprises as private businesses, and it is suggested that the new rural co-operatives found in China are increasingly caught in a “co-operative trilemma” and an emerging public–private “welfare partnership”. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is developed from a conceptual rationale of social enterprises as private businesses that are not primarily driven by financial profit but by a combination of economic and social objectives, whereby stakeholders from various institutional spheres (market, state and civil society) are increasingly involved. Based upon this, the paper analyses and synthesizes the main findings from 20 cases investigated during fieldwork conducted in China. Data were gathered through a combination of semi-structured interviews with key figures in the field and documentary analysis. Findings – The main findings show that new co-operatives in China indeed combine multiple resources, including members’ contributions and institutional capital, public financial support and market sales, as well as private non-market resources such as volunteering and donations. This empirical observation provides further evidence of the transformation process of Chinese rural co-operatives from classic mutual aids to a new model with a more outward community orientation and a multi-stakeholder character. Moreover, it was found that institutional environments facilitate or discourage co-operatives’ multiple resources formation. Based upon this empirical evidence it is seen how new Chinese rural co-operatives are caught in a “co-operative trilemma”, finding themselves “at the crossroads of market, public policy and civil society” and involved in an emerging public-private “welfare partnership”. Research limitations/implications – The research has implications for research on co-operatives and social enterprises in China, as well as policy implications with regard to the development of more favourable institutional support for co-operatives as rural <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations.</b> Originality/value – By addressing three research questions the paper contributes to the literature on the emergence of multi-stakeholder co-operatives in China (and in developing countries more generally) and contributes to the literature on the capital structure of co-operatives from practice and policy perspectives. Based upon evidence from China, the paper helps to explain how these newly emerging rural co-operatives in China, which are struggling against capital constraints when facing a highly competitive environment and trying to catch up through a process of diversification, just like many contemporary co-operatives in the West, are finding themselves caught in a new co-operative trilemma. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|As central cities redefine {{themselves}} {{after decades}} of commercial abandonment, “urban renaissance” movements, white flight, and the gentrification of their central urban neighborhoods, are cities still governed by the political-business coalitions conceptualized by urban regime theorists, or have new players emerged? Further, as cities continue to evolve within the post-Fordist landscape, do extant theories of urban governance, themselves built upon decades-old observations, continue to provide adequate models for urban governance as it actually exists in cities today? This dissertation is a quantitative and qualitative examination of contemporary urban governance in the United States, and the roles of CDCs and anchor institutions in urban decision-making structures. Chapter One begins {{with a description of}} Dallas, Texas, and two of its central urban neighborhoods – Downtown Dallas, the city’s CBD that is currently undergoing a conversion to mixed-use development; and North Oak Cliff, a former streetcar suburb that has suffered from a half-century of political and economic neglect, but has recently seen its fortunes dramatically improve. Chapter Two retells the interconnected histories of theories of urban governance, the socioeconomic impacts of Fordism, its crisis, and post-Fordism, and the evolution of Dallas from a regional industrial hub to a major commercial center, while highlighting a number of reasons why current conceptualizations of urban governance may no longer fit with actual urban governance. Chapter Three details this study’s methods – first, the use of census data from 1980 to 2010, and second, a reputational analysis of 79 participants who showed themselves to be highly knowledgeable about Dallas’ contemporary decision-making structure. Chapters Four, Five, and Six detail this study’s key findings – first, that modern urban decision-making occurs within multiple interconnected levels (neighborhood and city); second, that the structure of urban decision-making is still critical in understanding the nature of which decisions get made (and which do not), as well as the range of responses for a given situation; third, that Dallas’ <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> (e. g. CDCs and anchor institutions) have been largely unable to meaningfully involve themselves in the politics of decision-making; and finally, that under the right blend of economic- and political pressures, structures of urban governance can change from one type to another. In the Dallas case, the decline of its business coalition, and the court-ordered breakup of its at-large city council resulted in a new structure of governance, or better put, a non-structure, wherein multiple competing agendas and resource pools have taken over the larger political discourse, and have largely prevented a unified vision for Dallas from emerging...|$|R
40|$|No decorrer da história, muitos acontecimentos levaram a desumanização a fazer parte do cotidiano, contagiando, envolvendo famílias e pessoas indiscriminadamente, destruindo egos, dizimando relacionamentos. Criou-se a necessidade de olhares diferentes, olhares que trouxessem alento e esperança. Com isso, começaram a surgir as primeiras organizações chamadas filantrópicas, hoje conhecidas como Organizações Não Governamentais ou Organizações do Terceiro Setor. Quanto mais essa área crescia, tanto maior era o número de voluntários que se abdicavam em prol de seu próximo. Entretanto, esses voluntários, em seu papel de cuidadores, não eram cuidados. Armazenavam dores e desamores, sonhos destruídos e vidas repartidas, pois trabalham com gente, que há muito esqueceu o significado da palavra esperança. Portanto, a dissertação analisa esses cuidadores que começaram a ter a sua identidade perdida, demonstrando - nos atendimentos - a impressão de que precisavam ser lembrados e cuidados. A pesquisa busca criar um embasamento para uma profunda reflexão sobre a necessidade da conscientização, de treinamento e de reconhecimento do outro e do eu, bem como da importância do trabalho de grupo. O cuidador ajuda às pessoas a colocarem em ordem seu caos emocional e vivencial, mas é preciso que seja também ouvido e abraçado.

40|$|Nonprofit, {{community-based}} {{housing development}} organizations {{have only recently}} become significant players {{in the provision of}} affordable housing, at least in the United States. Historically, this job was left either in the hands of builders, developers, lenders and landlords of the business sector or in the care of agencies, planners and policymakers of the public sector. Only in the past 30 years has the provision of affordable housing moved beyond the familiar domains of the market and the state. A host of nonprofit organizations is now playing a larger role in constructing new housing, rehabilitating older housing, managing rentals and bringing home ownership within the reach of thousands of people for whom the American dream has proved elusive. The growth of these <b>third-sector</b> <b>organizations</b> has been both rapid and impressive, but it also has been uneven. Across the country, there are places where nonprofit housing development organizations are both plentiful and productive, supported by sophisticated networks of interorganizational collaboration, public funding, private financing and technical assistance. There are many other communities, however, where no nonprofits are engaged in affordable housing or where the ones that do exist are very new or very small, accounting for only a handful of new housing units every year. Lying between these two extremes are those communities where multiple nonprofits of varying size serve a similar geographic area, each producing a modest but respectable number of housing units; each competing for constituents, funding and development opportunities; each struggling to survive. The organizations that find themselves in this uncomfortable situation often confront a special set of challenges. They are productive, but not prolific. They are effective, but not efficient. They are successful, but not sustainable. Indeed, they are frequently quite precarious. The loss of a single staff person, the delay of a single project or the adverse decision of a single funder can threaten not only their short-term chances for success, but their long term prospects for survival. Those who sponsor and fund such organizations sometimes find themselves in a situation where competition among multiple nonprofits is weakening them all. In these cases, the sponsoring and funding organizations have taken different tacks to address this problem. In some cases, they have acted to strengthen every nonprofit, while working to increase the division of labor or the division of territory among them. In other cases, they have acted to strengthen one (or more) nonprofit {{at the expense of the}} others, culling weaker performers from the herd. While these have been the most common approaches for dealing with the weaknesses that organizational competition and duplication can sometimes create, a third alternative has been gaining ground. Multiple nonprofits, operating within the same jurisdiction, are being encouraged to collaborate [...] even to the point of merging their programs, assets and hard-won identities. Why is collaboration gaining in popularity? A financial explanation would be that it is becoming harder to find enough resources to strengthen every nonprofit to the same degree, funding multiple nonprofits to serve a similar clientele in the same locale. There is also the political reality that public and private funders find it difficult to choose easily (or accurately) which nonprofits should live [...] and which should die. There is a practical explanation as well. Collaboration is becoming a strategy of choice simply because it is proving to be an unusually effective way of achieving greater productivity, efficiency and sustainability. When a collaborative (or a merger) is carefully crafted, the nonprofit partners do a better job together than they did apart. This is not true in every case, of course.
