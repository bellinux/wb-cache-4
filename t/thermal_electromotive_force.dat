40|$|The {{hydrogenated}} {{samples of}} technical titanium were investigated using the EPA method and the {{measurements of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> for these samples saturated with a different amount of hydrogen. The structure of the hydrogenated samples was studied by the X-ray diffraction method. The results {{have shown that the}} hydrogenated titanium structure starts changing at the same time, depending on the amount of added hydrogen. The intensity of the annihilation process increases with the increase in the hydrogen concentration in a-titanium up to the values of 4 % wt and does not change up to the values of 5 % wt ([alpha]+[beta]) - titanium. At the same time, the value of the <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> decreases in this range of values. The annihilation intensity is stabilized for the values of 5 % wt, and the value of the <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> is increased. The inflection point for the <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> versus the hydrogen concentration corresponds to the formation of [delta] - hydrides. The increase in the positron lifetime starts in the concentration range of 6 - 8 % and moves to the stable level up to the concentrations of 21 - 22 %. In this range, there is a transition from the wt ([alpha]+[beta]) to the wt ([alpha]+[delta) phase. The lifetime of positrons and the number of defects are increased, the value of the <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> is reduced (up to the concentration of 24 %), then there is a stabilization mode for all these parameters up to the values 32 % wt...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{represents}} the investigations concerning the geometrical size effect of hydrogenated zirconium alloys (Zr- 1 Ni-H) during gamma-ray irradiation {{on the amount}} of energy absorbed. The results have shown that the less the cross-sectional dimensions of the sample or product is, the less energy is absorbed. The paper provides theoretical calculations. The zirconium sample with a cross-section of 2. 8 х 2. 8 cm absorbs 30 - 35 % of the energy of the incident gamma-ray flow. The increase in the cross-section of a product up to 28 cm leads to the increase in the absorbed energy by more than 2 times. At the same time, the thickness of the product is constant. This effect is explained by the multiple scattering of gamma-rays. It leads to the nonuniform distribution of defects which can accumulate hydrogen and should be considered when developing the analysis methods. These edge effects are confirmed by the measurement of the <b>thermal</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> for the samples of zirconium alloys before hydrogenation and gamma-ray irradiation, and after irradiation...|$|E
