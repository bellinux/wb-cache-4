She participated in the Coral Sea celebration with open house tours of the ship. The crew enjoyed much needed rest and relaxation and the warmth of the people of Australia. On 10 May, Vancouver departed Sydney for Melbourne, Australia arriving on 12 May. She was greeted warmly by the people and officials.|$|R
2500|$|Zoroastrians are not {{initiated}} by infant baptism. [...] Normally, {{a child is}} initiated into the faith {{when he or she}} is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. Parsis initate The <b>initiation</b> <b>begins</b> with <b>a</b> ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, sudre, and kusti. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is finished and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.|$|R
50|$|In B. terricola, {{there are}} three phases of colony development. The first phase, known as colony <b>initiation,</b> <b>begins</b> when <b>a</b> solitary queen starts to produce her first workers by laying diploid eggs. This leads to further eusociality within the colony and the queen’s {{continued}} efforts to produce more worker bees. The emergence of workers is essential for colony growth.The onset of the second phase, known as the switch point, is when the queen stops laying diploid eggs and starts making haploid eggs to produce male bees. During the third phase, the workers exhibit overt aggression towards each other and towards the queen. The beginning of the third phase {{is known as the}} competition point. Reciprocal oophagy also occurs during this third stage.|$|R

5000|$|According to the TM web site, the {{personal}} instruction session takes 1-2 hours, {{and students are}} required to bring a clean handkerchief, some flowers and fruit, and their course fee. The <b>initiation</b> <b>begins</b> with <b>a</b> short puja ceremony performed by the teacher. The stated purpose of the ceremony is to show honor and gratitude to the lineage of TM [...] "masters", or [...] "Holy Tradition" [...] that is listed in the Maharishi's translation and commentary of the Bhagavad-Gita. It is regarded as putting students in the right frame of mind to receive the mantra. The ceremony is conducted in a private room with a [...] "little" [...] white altar containing incense, camphor, rice, flowers and a picture of Maharishi's teacher, Guru Dev. The initiate observes passively as the teacher recites a text in Sanskrit. After the ceremony, the [...] "meditators" [...] are [...] "invited to bow", receive their mantra and begin to meditate.|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} significant {{expression of}} the matricellular protein, DEL 1, in hypertrophic and mature cartilage during development. We hypothesized that this tissue-specific expression indicated a biological role for DEL 1 in cartilage biology. Del 1 KO and WT mice had cartilage thickness evaluated by histomorphometry. Additional mice underwent medial meniscectomy to induce osteoarthritis, and were assayed at 1 week for apoptosis by TUNEL staining and at 8 weeks for histology and OA scoring. In vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed on primary chondrocytes. Deletion of the Del 1 gene led to decreased amounts of cartilage in the ears and knee joints in mice with otherwise normal skeletal morphology. Destabilization of the knee led to more severe OA compared to controls. In vitro, DEL 1 blocked apoptosis in chondrocytes. Osteoarthritis {{is among the most}} prevalent diseases worldwide and increasing in incidence as our population ages. <b>Initiation</b> <b>begins</b> with <b>an</b> injury resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators. Excessive production of inflammatory mediators results in apoptosis of chondrocytes. Because of the limited ability of chondrocytes to regenerate, articular cartilage deteriorates leading to the clinical symptoms including severe pain and decreased mobility. No treatments effectively block the progression of OA. We propose that direct modulation of chondrocyte apoptosis is a key variable in the etiology of OA, and therapies aimed at preventing this important step represent a new class of regenerative medicine targets...|$|R

40|$|The 30 S {{initiation}} complex, {{formed with}} the 30 S ribosomal subunit, mRNA, and fMet-tRNA, {{has been shown}} by kinetic analysis with limiting concentrations of Escherichia coli ribosomes to be an obligatory intermediate {{in the formation of}} the 70 S initiation complex. The formation of the 70 S <b>initiation</b> complex <b>began</b> with <b>an</b> induction period and was proportional to the concentration of the 30 S complex, which rapidly rose to a peak. The entire time course of the sequential pseudo-first-order, second-order reaction was reproduced accurately by the overall rate expression, in which we used rate constants that were determined by carrying out 30 S and 70 S complex formation separately. By using limiting concentrations of mRNA, we showed that phage MS 2 RNA contained no specific signal that enhanced its rate of 30 S complex formation with E. coli ribosomes and initiation factors; the pseudo-first-order rate constants obtained with poly(A 3 C 9 G 1 U 1), poly(C 15 G 1 U 4), and poly(G 1 U 3) were 12 - 45 times higher than that with MS 2 RNA. The observation that the rate constants for binding of fMet-tRNA and AcPhe-tRNA with a given synthetic RNA were comparable indicated that the initiator codon is recognized only indirectly through the initiator tRNA...|$|R
