5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E

5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's relations with <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup {{was the most}} supportive of Kennedy of all of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff. Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant {{for a second term}} in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944.

5|$|In April 1951, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces.

Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. <b>The</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|In June 1942, the Japanese {{occupied}} some of {{the western}} Aleutian islands, and hoped to occupy Amchitka.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1951, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there. The next day Truman met with {{the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control.

Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores.

5|$|On 8 December 1970, in {{response}} to a request from <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main impetus for the offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build-up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN go it alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a cross-border attack.|$|E

There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the Strategic Air Command, so the Air Materiel Command {{was directed to}} carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs.
