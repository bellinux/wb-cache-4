5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Inspector Morse TV series, {{the lead}} character, when seen at home, is often {{listening}} to music on his Xerxes. According to the manufacturers, the producers of the show deliberately sought to feature one in the series, from the first episode, to highlight Morse's passion for music. In the first episode, <b>The</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>of</b> Jericho, the people associated with the fictional manufacturer of the turntable (Richards Audio Research) were {{the focal point of}} the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music was}} {{by this time}} championed by, among others, Pierre Boulez, who {{programmed}} first performances at his Domaine musical concerts and the Donaueschingen festival. Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more brass, wind, percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E

2500|$|Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living <b>Dead</b> is <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> six ...<b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> films {{directed}} by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released Dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> Day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> Diary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> and Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead.</b> Each film traces the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>dead</b> epidemic in <b>the</b> United States and humanity's desperate attempts {{to cope with}} it. As in Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living <b>Dead,</b> Romero peppered <b>the</b> other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods {{in which they were}} released.|$|R
50|$|Directed by Nicolas Garreau. Fan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> is a 2003 52 minute {{documentary}} road-movie {{revealing the}} filming locations of Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living <b>Dead,</b> Dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> Day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> and Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living <b>Dead</b> remake with exclusive {{interviews with the}} cast of the George A.

5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making reference to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what {{the modern state}} stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War. Many Zimbabweans see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the black majority. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} stone font {{dates from}} the 12th century but is set on a modern base. It has five panels, four of which are decorated with interlacing carvings of crosses and knots while the fifth is blank. The other fittings of the church date from the 19th century and include an octagonal pulpit with decorated panels. The west wall of the nave has a stone memorial to a Reverend William Griffith who died in 1752, the south wall has a war memorial to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the First World War, and the north wall has an inscribed stone commemorating a Morris Lloyd (or Llwyd), a Royalist who was killed by Cromwell's troops in 1647.|$|E
5|$|The ruined {{walls of}} the {{observatory}} are a prominent feature on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built {{on top of the}} observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather. Although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof of the shelter overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A war memorial to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> World War II is located next to the observatory.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{memorials}} {{were also}} involved in the civil wars and ethnic disputes of the inter-war period. After independence and the civil war, for example, the Republic of Ireland did not prioritise commemorating <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> World War I, and indeed the events were largely ignored. Attempts to construct memorials during the 1930s, such as the National War Memorial Gardens in Dublin, were discouraged by the Republican movement and finally blocked altogether in 1939. By contrast, Unionists in Northern Ireland made the war {{a key part of}} their political narrative, emphasising their role in events such as the Battle of the Somme. Monuments were erected in prominent locations in the centres of key Northern Ireland cities.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was {{the first}} {{memorial}} to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to have}} insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing. Other memorials followed: the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme and the Arras Memorial designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial for the forces of India, the Vimy Memorial by Canada, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial by Australia, the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's men {{advanced}} to the Rio Grande in March 1846. Polk's attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed, and war appeared imminent. Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river. Polk, learning of the Thornton Affair, told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun. That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma. Though greatly outnumbered, he defeated the Mexican force, which consisted of the Army of the North, commanded by General Mariano Arista, and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande. Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the wounded Mexican soldiers, giving them the same care as {{was given to the}} American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.|$|E

5|$|There was {{uncertainty}} {{as to how}} {{to treat}} the wider battlefields surrounding these monuments. At the end of the war, visitors and tourists could easily see the damage caused by the war and the detritus of the fighting, but post-war reconstruction meant that by the 1930s most of this damage along the Western front had been restored. In several cases, veterans felt that the battlefields should be maintained in their immediate post-war condition as memorials; the reconstruction of the town of Ypres was opposed by some who favoured keeping the ruins as a memorial. It was proposed to leave the fortifications of Douaumont in ruins as a memorial to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>of</b> Verdun, and the {{issue of whether or not}} to replant the region with trees in the 1930s proved controversial with veterans. Some parts of the trench systems were preserved intact as memorials, however, including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial and the trench system at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. In other theatres, such as Iraq and Palestine, reconstruction took much longer and bodies remained unburied at least until 1929.|$|E
