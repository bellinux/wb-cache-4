40|$|Some {{selected}} determinants {{influencing the}} quantity of furniture in household are described in this paper. Data for the analysis concerned with urban and rural households were derived from questionnaire surveys. The following characteristics are considered: number of persons, number of children up {{to the age of}} 14, age of the householder, duration of household, family monthly income, number of working family members, number of rooms in a dwelling, surface of a dwelling, arable area, intensity of livestock and crop production. The analysis was made in regional crossections (<b>town</b> <b>—</b> <b>country</b> districts) and with regard to assortment groups. The quantity of furniture in urban households is especially dependent on the size of household, duration of household, family monthly income and the surface of a dwelling. The influence of the other factors appears to be of less significance. As to rural households the most significant factors shaping {{the quantity of}} furniture are number of rooms in a dwelling and intensity of livestock and crop production of a farm.
