For this purpose, <b>tannery</b> <b>effluent</b> was collected from “Up flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket” (UASB) Jajmau, Kanpur. Plants of Eichhornia crassipes were exposed to various concentrations of <b>tannery</b> <b>effluent</b> (0. 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) for 2 and 7 days durations. Plants accumulated significant (p< 0. 01) amount of Cr (a major constituent of <b>tannery</b> <b>effluent)</b> in a concentration duration dependent manner; which was more in roots (220 mg g - 1 dw) than in leaves (83 mg g - 1 dw). <b>Tannery</b> <b>effluent</b> induced oxidative stress was evident by increased level of MDA content. To combat oxidative stress plants showed alleviated level of antioxidants as its defense mechanism. Among enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activity increased over to control upto 2 nd days of treatment however on exposure of long duration i. e. 7 days these antioxidants declined in correspond to various treatments. Similarly non enzymatic antioxidants (carotenoid and ascorbic acid content) which scavenged free radicals efficiently also showing elevation at all concentrations up to 2 days exposure over unstressed plants, thereafter responded in decreasing manner due to ill effects of treatments.

In this study the physicochemical and biochemical qualities of the <b>tannery</b> <b>effluents</b> were analyzed to determine the pollution load of the openly released wastewaters in the environment and the findings were compared with the non-tannery waters. Fourteen samples of factory effluents were collected from the leather tanning industrial zone of Hazaribagh, Dhaka, and 13 non-tannery water samples were collected from different parts of Dhaka city. The effluents were mostly colored; their pH varied from highly acidic to basic values while densities were not much different from the non-tannery waters. The chromium contents of the effluents varied from less than 0. 002 to 18. 97 mg/L and the chemical oxygen demands (COD) varied from 90 to 6500 mg/L, which were significantly higher than those of non-tannery waters. There was a strong direct correlation between chromium content and COD (p< 0. 01) indicating that chromium was hugely responsible for pollution caused by <b>tannery</b> <b>effluents.</b> The <b>tannery</b> wastewaters were highly toxic to brine shrimp nauplii (lethality: about 82 %), and chromium was responsible for biotoxicity of the effluents since a direct significant correlation (p< 0. 021) was found between chromium content and lethality. Storage of the wastewater samples for 2 to 8 months at room temperature showed rise in the pH values possibly due to microbial action that resulted in decrease of dissolved chromium content from a mean value of 7. 94 to 5. 09 mg/L. These findings demonstrated that the presence of high concentrations of chromium and other chemicals in the untreated <b>tannery</b> <b>effluents</b> were contributing adverse effects on the environment and ecosystem.
