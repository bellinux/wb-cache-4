5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Emperor, {{had started to}} reform <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E
5|$|Austerlitz and the {{subsequent}} Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army needed reform. Napoleon had offered Charles <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> throne after Austerlitz, an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles' brother, Austrian emperor Francis II. Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army, Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), a military advisory board, to oversee the activities of Charles as supreme commander.|$|E
50|$|The Turkish/Ottoman {{move up the}} River Danube {{was also}} of concern to <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> who moved forces into Transylvania in response. However, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> had begun to fear the Russians more than the Turks. Indeed, like <b>the</b> British, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> were now coming to see that an intact Ottoman Empire was {{necessary}} as a bulwark against the Russians. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> resisted Russian diplomatic attempts to join the war on the Russian side. Austria remained neutral in the Crimean War.|$|R
50|$|After Napoleon Bonaparte {{granted the}} Venetian domains to <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> <b>the</b> Podestà House {{was used by}} <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> as barracks; later it became a {{property}} of the commune of Lonato, under which it fell into disrepair.|$|R

On <b>the</b> left, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> managed {{to conduct a}} capable rear guard action, but during the day the French smashed their opponents' right flank and captured thousands of soldiers. The day ended with <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> barely holding onto a line behind the Große Laber River.|$|R
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{crossing}} of the Alps, Napoleon commenced military operations against <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army. Despite an inauspicious start to the campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> forces were driven back to Marengo after nearly a month. There, a large battle took place on 14 June, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> evacuation of Italy.|$|E

50|$|On 9 December, in <b>the</b> night, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> French advanced posts at {{the ruins}} of the old post house and church of the old village of Kehl. The fighting was bitter and short, but <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> finally took <b>the</b> post, to be driven out the next morning. In this subsequent attack, at which Archduke Charles was present, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> lost about three hundred men and an officer. They attacked again on the 10 and 11 December, but could not take <b>the</b> posts. <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> also launched fire ships to destroy the pontoon bridge, but these were repulsed and destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> took <b>the</b> Ehrlinrhin, a large island on which several of the French reserve units had been positioned. General Lecourbe removed one of the flying bridges to cut off all hope of a (French) retreat, grabbed a standard and rallied a battalion to advance against <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> repulsing them as far as their trenches. Lecourbe's quick thinking preserved half of the island for the French.|$|R

5|$|The Erzherzog Ferdinand Max class {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} ironclad warships and built for <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Navy in the 1860s. They were the last broadside armored frigates to be built for <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Empire, and the last vessels completed to see action against the Italians at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Intended to have been armed with new breech-loading Krupp guns, the outbreak of the Seven Weeks' War prevented the delivery of the guns, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Navy to arm the ships with a battery of sixteen older 48-pounder muzzle-loading guns.|$|E
5|$|The French {{fell back}} c. 3km and {{attempted}} to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle {{was as good as}} won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief-of-staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. <b>The</b> <b>Austrian</b> centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> right wing, O'Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his troops out of supporting distance from <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> main body. On <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> left, Ott hesitated to press hard against the French because GdB Jean Rivaud's small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.|$|E
50|$|According to the Danes, 210 Danes and 406 Austrians {{were killed}} or wounded during the battle. According to <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> however, <b>the</b> Danes lost 962 men and <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> only 431.|$|R
50|$|A 1704 {{campaign}} by Kuruc forces liberated much of Hungary from Austrian rule and established numerical parity with <b>the</b> <b>Austrians.</b> However, due to better training, a stronger officer corps and deeper logistical capabilities, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> still won <b>the</b> decisive Battle of Nagyszombat, {{going on to}} take back the important fortresses of (Buda, Pressburg and Esztergom). <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> subsequently called on aid from Croatian, Serbian and Danish armies.|$|R
50|$|Perczel’s legion {{contained}} approximately 6,500 {{soldiers and}} 24 cannon. The northern area near Mór was disadvantageous, {{because it was}} surrounded by a forest which <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> could easily break through. Perczel had determination, and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> had a smaller army there made him more confident. But he did not reconnoitre <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> so he did not realise how powerful they were.|$|R

5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and resolved to do whatever he can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, {{charging}} that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey {{at the top of the}} hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E

50|$|First <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> town of Pfaffenhofen {{and were}} met by French fire.But <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> took <b>the</b> town in house-to-house combat in which the fierce Croatian Pandurs inflicted heavy casualties on the French defenders.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} 100 years, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> and <b>the</b> Ottomans both began to slowly lose {{their power to}} the French, British, Prussians and Russians. Both the Ottomans and <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> lacked <b>the</b> heavy {{industry}} of their other European counterparts, but the Ottomans were further behind than <b>the</b> <b>Austrians.</b> Thus, Ottoman power decayed faster than <b>Austrian</b> power. In <b>the</b> Balkans, the increasingly prevalent nationalistic cries for independence became a bigger problem for the more militarily incompetent Ottomans. After 1867, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> compromised with <b>the</b> Hungarians to form Austria-Hungary, thus preventing a major ethnic group from rebelling in the shorter term. The same benefits could not be had with the Ottomans.|$|R
5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some states had already begun to refuse payment of taxes to <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of Hainaut and Brabant were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|By {{threatening}} {{the independence of}} the states, the interests of the nobility and the position of the church, the reforms acted as a force to unite these groups against <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Despite token {{criticism}} of the partition from <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> archduchess, Empress Maria Theresa, Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz considered <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> share an ample compensation; despite Austria being the least interested in the partition, it received the largest share of formerly Polish population, and second largest land share (83,000km2 and 2,650,000 people). Austria gained Zator and Auschwitz (Oświęcim), part of Little Poland embracing parts of the counties of Kraków and Sandomierz (with the rich salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka), and the whole of Galicia, less the city of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian {{forces from}} crossing the Vistula river, and forced <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> {{to retreat from}} occupied Warsaw. Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> also won a few battles but were hampered {{by the presence of}} Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and that did not allow them to advance. Eventually, the defeat of <b>the</b> main <b>Austrian</b> army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|R
500|$|Day-by-day, over time, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} French, who hampered {{by the lack of}} bridges or appropriate transport, could not bring up enough reserves to preserve the lost ground. [...] Boats were stove by fire of the cannon; by the time bridges were repaired and sufficient reserves could be moved, <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> were entrenched, and had brought up their artillery. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> continued to advance their earth works, and perfect their batteries.|$|R
50|$|However, what {{followed}} was the most successful series of battles for <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> in over a decade. Jérôme was slow in his pursuit, allowing Kienmayer to head south and confront Junot. <b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> first managed to stop Junot's advanced guard and then engaged Junot's main force on 8 July 1809 at Gefrees. This was the largest battle on the northern front during the whole war and ended in a decisive victory for <b>the</b> <b>Austrians.</b>|$|R
5|$|During her trials, UB-8 was {{assigned}} <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> number of U-8 and an Austrian commander.

5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{was born}} on 11 December 1908 in Vienna, then {{the capital of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire, to a wealthy family in the book {{publishing}} industry. Göth joined a Nazi youth group at age 17 and {{was a member of the}} antisemitic nationalist paramilitary group Heimwehr (Home Guard) from 1927 to 1930. He dropped his membership to join <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> branch of the Nazi Party, and was assigned the party membership number 510,764 in September 1930. Göth joined <b>the</b> <b>Austrian</b> SS in 1930 and was appointed an SS-Mann with the SS number 43,673.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish had {{expected}} material help from <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> promised under <b>the</b> Treaty of Vienna, but they received little. They had been outmanoeuvred by British diplomats, who had concluded a secret deal with <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> {{to prevent them}} intervening.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Austrians</b> lost 1,500 {{killed or}} wounded and 300 prisoners. The Spanish lost 1,500 {{killed or wounded}} and 200 prisoners. Messina {{was taken by the}} Spanish, but the Marquis de Lede didn't take to {{opportunity}} to drive <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> completely from <b>the</b> island, leaving them a bridgehead around Milazzo. This bridgehead and naval supremacy after the Battle of Cape Passaro, gave <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> a chance to send over more troops the next year, leading to the Battle of Francavilla.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle of}} Sassello {{was a minor}} {{skirmish}} during the war of the Second Coalition, fought on 10 April 1800 between a 2,000-men French force under General Jean-de-Dieu Soult and a largely superior <b>Austrian</b> corps under <b>the</b> command of Prince Prince Hohenzollern. The battle took place 30 kilometers northwest of Genoa, which {{was at the time}} under French control but under siege by <b>the</b> <b>Austrians.</b> <b>The</b> skirmish at Sassello ended in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Austrians,</b> with either side losing about 1,000 men but with <b>the</b> <b>Austrians</b> being able to pursue their encirclement of Genoa.|$|R
