5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

500|$|Abraham Geiger, {{the founder}} of Reform Judaism, remarked the {{following}} concerning the claim that Jews believed Ezra to be the son of God: “According to the assertion of Muhammad the Jews held Ezra to be the Son of God. This is certainly a mere misunderstanding which arose from the great esteem in which Ezra was undoubtedly held. This esteem is expressed in <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> ‘Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him.’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews’ faith in the unity of God, and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing.” ...|$|E
500|$|The Court of Appeal {{clarified}} in Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh v.

500|$|Aristarchus thus {{believed}} the stars {{to be very}} far away, and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, {{was assumed to be}} an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> from Plutarch suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon): ...|$|E

500|$|Beliefs about {{slow lorises}} {{and their use}} in {{traditional}} practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. [...] More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} tone clusters in a Western music composition thus far identified {{is in the}} Allegro movement of Heinrich Biber's Battalia à 10 (1673) for string ensemble, which calls for several diatonic clusters. An orchestral diatonic cluster occurs also in the representation of chaos in the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel's 1737–38 ballet [...] From the next century-and-a-half, a few more examples have been identified, mostly {{no more than a}} fleeting instance of the form, for example in the concluding two bars of the “Loure” from J.S.Bach’s French Suite No.5, BWV816:, or the delicious collisions that result from the interaction of multiple lines [...] "locked together in suspensions" [...] in Bach’s Musical Offering: [...] However, in the Keyboard Sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757), we find a more daring and idiosyncratic use of tone clusters. In <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>passage</b> from the , Scarlatti builds the dissonances over several bars: Ralph Kirkpatrick (1953) says that these chords “are not clusters {{in the sense that they}} are arbitrary blobs of dissonance, nor are they necessarily haphazard fillings up of diatonic intervals or simultaneous soundings of neighboring tones; they are logical expressions of Scarlatti’s harmonic language and organic manifestations of his tonal structure.” Clusters also feature in French programmatic compositions for the harpsichord or piano that represent cannon fire with clusters, for example in works by François Dandrieu (Les Caractères de la guerre, 1724), Michel Corrette (La Victoire d'un combat naval, remportée par une frégate contre plusieurs corsaires réunis, 1780), Claude-Bénigne Balbastre (March des Marseillois, 1793), Pierre Antoine César (La Battaille de Gemmap, ou la prise de Mons, [...] 1794), [...] Bernard Viguerie (La Bataille de Maringo, pièce militaire et hitorique, for piano trio, 1800), and Jacques-Marie Beauvarlet-Charpentier (Battaille d'Austerlitz, 1805).|$|E
