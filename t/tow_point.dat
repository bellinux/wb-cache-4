5000|$|Bridle position, spine curve, {{centre of}} gravity, and balance of {{tension on the}} spars all {{play a role in}} how the kite spins and tracks. Afghan and Indian fighter kites and their {{variants}} have their bridles attached in two places on the kite's spine. The first place is at the crossing of the bow and the spine. The second attachment is three-quarters to two-thirds of the total length of the spine from the nose of the kite. The length of the top line to the <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> is the length between the two bridle to spine connection points. The length of the bottom bridle to the <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> is between half an inch to two inches (1.2-5 cm) longer than the length of the two spine connections. The spine of the kite has a slight convex curve toward the face of the kite. To make the kite spin more, the upper bridle line is shortened: to make the kite spin less, the lower bridle line is shortened [...] Left and right tracking are adjusted by either placing weight on the tip of a wing, or by weakening the bow on the side that you want the kite to track towards. The design of the kite plays a role in the tendency for the kite to spin and pull, and how much wind the kite can handle. Bridling and tuning are only effective when the kite chosen is able to handle the amount of wind that it is being flown in. If the wind is so strong that the spine and bow are severely distorted, no amount of bridle tuning will help with making the kite controllable. A crude method of making a kite flyable in over-strong wind, used in India where the kites are cheap and regarded as disposable, is to burn small holes in the flying surface, typically using a cigarette.|$|E

The basic thinking behind the approach adopted, is {{to deal with a}} better towing stability than employing the typical towline model 1. Several towing parameters which may affect a towed ship motion behaviour i. e., tow angle and <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> position, are investigated theoretically. The nonlinear numerical time-domain simulation showed that the increase of towing angle up to 30 degrees and shifting <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> from 0. 5 to 0. 8 resulted in remarkable reduction in slewing motion of the unstable towed ship and the towline tension, which enhances effectively her towing stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aerial {{refueling}} hose-and-drogue {{system is a}} special case of a generalized aerial cable towed system. The present work investigates the effect of pertinent parameters such as the cable tension, <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> disturbance and vortex wake on the dynamic behavior and stability of the generalized model by using the finite element method with an accurate and computationally efficient three-noded, curved beam element. The analysis {{results show that the}} conventional modal and spectrum analysis method is inappropriate for the dynamic stability analysis of the aerial cable towed system. This is because the mechanism of instability due to the <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> disturbance is not the resonance of the aerial cable towed system but the wave propagation downstream along the cable absorbing energy from the airflow when the wave propagation speed is less than the airflow speed. The study also demonstrates that the vortex wake has {{a significant impact on the}} dynamics of the aerial cable towed system. The short cable system will orbit with the vortex and the orbiting behavior will diminish as the cable length increases...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the mathematical modeling {{and analysis of}} helicopters towing submerged loads using long cables for sub-surface object detection when surface-based vessels cannot operate safely. A geometrically exact model of rotating beams is derived, and used to represent both the cable dynamics and rotor blade dynamics. Flight dynamics and trim conditions for an axially flexible straight cable and a curved cable are separately formulated for a general case of helical climbing turns, and used to cross-validate each other. In steady flight, the trim longitudinal dynamics of the submerged load produces down-forces from towed body fins, increasing the apparent weight of the tow system. Cable and towed body drag manifest as increases in the effective equivalent flat- plate area, necessitating excessive nose-down helicopter trim pitch attitudes (- 6 &# 9702;) and causing pilot discomfort. Excessive pitch attitudes can be avoided using aft offset of the helicopter <b>tow</b> <b>point,</b> or the deployment of longer cables in combination with pitching fins to regulate towed body depth. In steady level turning flight, cable and towed body drag result in the submerged load turning with a consistently smaller radius than the helicopter. Depth regulation in turning flight using pitching fins is less effective than in forward flight due to increased cable drag opposing larger down-forces. Analysis of linearized models showed that the helicopter frequency response to pilot inputs is unaffected {{by the addition of}} the cable and towed body above 1 rad/s. The low-frequency response magnitude reduces with increasing hydrodynamic drag on the cable and towed body, and is unaffected by cable structural properties due to over-damped stabilization from hydrodynamics. The swashplate inputs required to guide the towed body along a "tear-drop" shaped trajectory are obtained using a two-stage process. The motions of the <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> that guide the submerged load along the target path are obtained using an optimization process. The system target states are generated based on these <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> motions, and an LQR controller is used to guide the helicopter along its target path. Trim rotor inflows from the vortex wake model are obtained at the various equilibrium points used to construct helicopter target states, interpolated and applied as "delta" corrections to the dynamic inflow model. Blade elastic twist has a significant effect on rotor power predictions and the steady hub loads, while flap bending elasticity acts as a vibration absorber to attenuate the oscillatory component of hub rolling and pitching moments...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of a typical Australian omni-directional stem drive tug a series of physical model tests with systematically varied hull appendages have been carried out. Three hull configurations where tested, the first corresponds to the traditional stem drive hull, the second with significantly reduced skeg area aft and the third with reduced skeg area and the addition of a box keel from the stem to the aft end of the skeg. The latter being the intended configuration. The anticipated outcome of these changes Is to reduce negative thruster-hull interaction and to improve {{the performance of}} the tug at high speeds and in the so-called indirect mode where hull forces are used to supplement reduced thruster forces. The model experiments show that the changes move the centre of pressure of the sway force forward, towards the <b>tow</b> <b>point,</b> and increase both the sway force coefficient and the profile area making the sway force larger. As a result of this the performance of the tug in pushing and in the indirect mode at high speed have been significantly increased while performance in pulling direct has remained essentially unchanged. The experiments also show that there is reduced thruster hull interaction when pulling direct...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} the hydrodynamic forces on cylinders where the angle between incoming flow and the cylinder axis, {{the angle of}} attack, is low. Measured results for a rigid cylinder with length to diameter ratio of 40 towed at both constant angle of attack and oscilllating in the transverse direction are used to discuss the applicability of suggested methods like the cross flow or the 2 D+t principle. It is found that the longitudional flow do influence the transverse forces. The importance of the flow pattern initiated at {{the nose of the}} cylinder is clearly illustrated. A combination of linear and quadratic dependence on the sine of the angle is used to model the response of a flexible cylinder with forced oscillation of the <b>tow</b> <b>point.</b> The result is compared to experimental result for a flexible cylinder with length to diameter ratio of 1100 and Reynolds numbers in and above the critical range. The cylinder is simulated in time domain with a Finite Element Method with second order elements.

40|$|A {{high speed}} towed vehicle “FLYING FISH” is being {{developed}} to measure chemical and physical properties of the ocean. The depth, pitch and roll of FLYING FISH are controlled by a main wing and horizontal tail wings. The roll control {{is based on the}} PID control method and the depth and pitch control are based on the LQI (linear quadratic with integral) control method. The LQI controller was designed in consideration of the mathematical model of the towing cable. The experimental results controlled by the LQI controller were successful around the near equilibrium point but it seems that the performance is reduced at far field. The reason is that towing tension is drastically changing with the submerged depth of the vehicle and the linear mathematical model of the towing cable changes from that of equilibrium point. In this paper, the H_infty controller is designed in consideration of the change of the towing tension at the <b>towing</b> <b>point</b> versus submerged depth in order to improve the performance of the depth and pitch control.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} investigation {{on the effect}} of different tow rope lengths and arrangements for a towed ship in calm water by using the experimental model conducted at Marine Technology Centre, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Three variations of tow rope arrangements were tested in the experiment: Straighttow, V-tow and Kite-tow. A total of fourteen types of tow rope arrangements were tested at a constant speed of 0. 5 m/s and a rake-barge were captured via Qualysis Track Manager (QTM) „Image Processing Techniques?. From the experiment, it was observed that for Straight-tow, the tow rope length increment was proportional to the oscillation where for every increment of Lv length (length of tow rope in V shape arrangement) reduced the oscillations by around 12 %. Kite-tow arrangement design offered a better safety towing system and has nearly zero sway motion but large water width due to the drift distance from the <b>tow</b> <b>point</b> which is around 0. 64 and 1. 1 times barge length. The result from Straight-tow with different skegs arrangement s showed significant improvement in reducing the sway motion pf the towed barge. Similarly, V-tow barge with different skegs arrangements also presented a substantial improvement in decreasing the amount of sway motion. In the final part of the research, computer simulation using FORTRAN program and codes from Yasukawa & Fitriadhy (2010) were carried out and the results were compared with the experimental model of Straight-tow barge. Computer simulations and model experiment results showed less than 10 % deviation in sway motions...|$|E
40|$|Optimizing the {{performance}} of an escort tug {{is an important part}} of the design process, but the impact of tug performance on total system performance is the critical issue. Whilst tug performance can be predicted with model experiments, this is an impractical method for evaluating the combined tug-towrope-tanker system. Numerical simulation of the total system is a much more practical option, since numerical maneuvering models for ships are well established and can easily include the predicted trajectory of the tanker under the action of a force generated by the tug. The challenging part of the simulation is providing a realistic estimate of the tug performance.

Firstly, Kinetic equations based on spinor are built, where the cable is discretized {{into a number of}} rigid segments while the decoy is modeled as a rigid body hinged on the cable.

Subsequently, the efficiency and validity of this algorithm are verified by comparison with Kane’s function and further validated by wind tunnel tests. Simulation results indicate that the distance between the <b>towing</b> <b>point</b> and the decoy’s center of gravity is suggested to be 5 %– 20 % of the length of decoy body to ensure the stability of system. In up-risen maneuver process, the value of angular velocity is recommended to be less than 0. 10 rad/s to protect the cable from the aircraft exhaust jet.

The system is also useful for fishing vessels to control the power of generators during the draw in fishing gears for a long time in low speed. Although，the drawback to a fishing vessel with this system is that it will be a worry to the course stability in the voyage. A large number of studies have been made on maneuverability of conventional ships. What seems to be lacking，however，is the course stability of the fishing vessel with the azimuthing podded drive system. "In this paper，a new evaluation method of course stability is proposed on the basis of experimental study that is conducted in a circulating water channel on survey of slewing motion in at owed condition. As a <b>towing</b> <b>point</b> moves to forward in a constant speed, the amplitude of slewing motion (a) decreases and its period (T) is getting longer.
