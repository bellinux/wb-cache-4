5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table.

Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, making him a social outcast.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October, PA {{police arrested}} two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, {{where in the}} {{preceding}} weeks a hundred Palestinians had been killed, nearly two dozen of them minors. Rumours quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinian mourners gathered {{in front of the}} station calling for their death. Both soldiers were beaten, stabbed, and disembowelled, and one body was set on fire. An Italian television crew captured the killings on video and then broadcast his tape internationally. A British journalist had his camera destroyed by rioters as he attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture.</b> The brutality of the killings shocked the Israeli public, who saw it as proof of a deep-seated Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jews. In response, Israel launched a series of retaliatory air-strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police station where the lynching had taken place was evacuated and destroyed in these operations. Israel later tracked down and arrested those responsible for killing the soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{great thing}} about Kylie is that she differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the public wants to see.

50|$|Colonies can be {{enumerated}} from {{pictures of}} plates using software tools.

Since it takes less than 10 seconds <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> single <b>picture,</b> as opposed to several minutes to count CFU manually, this approach generally saves a lot of time. In addition, it is more objective and allows extraction of other variables such as the size and colour of the colonies.|$|R

2500|$|Money is {{primarily}} obtained {{in an unusual}} way. One of the Magnus that can be put into a deck is a camera, available in three different levels of quality or effectiveness. When in battle, the character can use the camera <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of an enemy. After the battle, that picture will develop in about ten real time minutes. Once fully developed, a photo's value {{is primarily}} determined by the enemy photographed as well as conditions in effect at the time. Photos of rarer enemies (i.e. bosses) are worth more. If the enemy blocks a camera shot, the enemy in the photo will appear somewhat distorted and will be worth less. Using light or dark attacks along with the camera will make the photo lighter or darker, respectively. A photo will sell for less if it is too bright or too dark. Photos of PCs normally have very low sellback value, {{but there is a}} small chance of getting [...] "rare shots" [...] that are worth a decent amount.|$|E

2500|$|Typical cache [...] "treasures", {{also known}} in the geocaching world as swag, are not high in {{monetary}} value but may hold personal value to the finder. Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual coins or currency, small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal Geocoins, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location. Disposable cameras are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below. Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called [...] "hitchhikers", such as Travel Bugs or Geocoins, whose travels may be logged and followed online. Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are {{to be placed in}} a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called [...] "FTF"), or in locations which are harder to reach. Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.|$|E

Though the police were going after a person uninvolved with the drug lord, his triggermen stopped the PFM cars and ordered them to call their boss. When the police commander arrived at the scene minutes later, Inzunza Inzunza walked {{up to him and}} smacked him several times, telling him he had no permission to be in his territory and to never stop by again. When the drug lord ordered them to leave, his gunmen took away their weapons for a couple of days. On 12 November 2002 in Culiacán, the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) intercepted a convoy of gunmen in which Inzunza Inzunza was traveling. A shootout eventually broke out, resulting in the death of four policemen and one gunmen. However, Inzunza Inzunza managed to escape the scene. Three years later on April 2005, Inzunza Inzunza intimidated several police officers who were patrolling his neighborhood and forced them to return to their headquarters. On 5 May 2005, Inzunza Inzunza travelled to Mazatlán to attend a rehab center for his drug addiction. While heading there, he was arrested by the Mazatlán Municipal Police with eight of his men. The police confiscated several assault rifles, handguns, grenades, and grenade launchers. The arrest of Inzunza Inzunza was initially reported by a photojournalist who managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him, but the drug lord never made it to prison; unconfirmed reports stated that he bribed the police to avoid going to jail.
