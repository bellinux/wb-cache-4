[...] During his campaign launch, he said, [...] "We don't need to re-invent the Party. We just need {{to give it back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> its rightful owners. We need to take it back from the backroom players who hide behind new faces." [...] He highlighted education and training issues, and said that Canada should be more accommodating to new immigrants. [...] Volpe also argued that Canada should return to a peacekeeping ethos in foreign affairs, rather than primarily engaging in combat missions. [...] After the party's first all-candidates debate, he accused frontrunner Michael Ignatieff of echoing the foreign policy vision of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{felt that}} by killing Dixie, it was {{unexpected}} and went beyond [...] "just being {{about the women}} of Fusion". Killing Dixie was {{to send a message}} that anyone could be the next to die. [...] "In order for a story like this to have real impact, it's not just about the reaction of our environment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lost," [...] Carruthers said. [...] "You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked , but a character with as much history as Dixie.... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's {{at the bottom of the}} pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{celebration of}} Bulgari's 130th anniversary, Majida El Roumi {{has been named}} the first Middle East Humanitarian Ambassador of the Bulgari – Save the Children Partnership in July 2014 and joins the likes of Naomi Watts, Dita Von Teese, Meg Ryan, and Leighton Meester {{and so many others}} in the support of this worthy cause. The {{partnership}} between one of the industry’s leading jewelry houses and the world’s largest independent international organization running programs in developing and developed countries has generated over AED 98 million and benefited under-privileged children in 23 countries around the globe. [...] El Roumi is responsible for the overall direction, leadership, and coordination of Save the Children programs in Jordan as it was told in the press conference that took place at Al Bustan Hotel- Lebanon, {{in the presence of a}} crowd of Lebanese journalists and dignitaries. The renowned Spanish photographer Fabrizio Ferri has actively supported this initiative with his time and talent. Over the years, he has photographed over 200 celebrities wearing the ring and the pendant in support of Bvlgari’s commitment to quality schooling for the world’s neediest children including Majida, whose poster was officially launched during the press conference. Majida clearly stated during the press conference [...] "I will strive to bring joy to my surroundings and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in need of it. Everything that's happening is a crime in every meaning of the word. I feel that I have a mission and my appointment is for a cause that I truly believe in. I will travel the extra mile and do what I can regardless of the size of my mission." [...] She also [...] added, “There is no financial rewards for my participation in this humanitarian effort, as financial things do not bring happiness.” ...|$|E

They destroy and distort their organs of pronunciation by excessive use of the betel-nut and pepper leaf and lime, so that no word is articulately pronounced. It is very hard to catch the sounds they make amidst the hubbub on deck or the crowds on shore; yet I think that if we had two or three lads quietly with us at Norfolk Island, we should soon make out something.|$|E

I do not go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> better off than I am and ask them to help support me, nor do I see the least reason why those who are worse off than I am should expect me to support them.' Mr. Wensome tried to appeal to his humanity, and the brute only continued to laugh in a cynical way. He declared that poor people did not interest him. His tenants he was prepared to look after--outside his own property he didn't care a snap of the fingers whether people lived or died. Mr. Wensome said it was perfectly awful to hear him talk, and he came away without a penny. Yet his property in this country alone is worth fifty thousand a year.|$|E
60|$|We {{have now}} {{examined}} the three fundamental {{conditions of the}} adaptation of forms of government <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> to be governed by them. If the supporters {{of what may be}} termed the naturalistic theory of politics, mean but to insist on the necessity of these three conditions; if they only mean that no government can permanently exist which does not fulfill the first and second conditions, and, in some considerable measure, the third; their doctrine, thus limited, is incontestable. Whatever they mean more than this appears to me untenable. All that we are told about the necessity of an historical basis for institutions, of their being in harmony with the national usages and character, and the like, means either this, or nothing to the purpose. There is a great quantity of mere sentimentality connected with these and similar phrases, over and above the amount of rational meaning contained in them. But, considered practically, these alleged requisites of political institutions are merely so many facilities for realising the three conditions. When an institution, or a set of institutions, has the way prepared for it by the opinions, tastes, and habits of the people, they are not only more easily induced to accept it, but will more easily learn, and will be, from the beginning, better disposed, to do what is required of them both for the preservation of the institutions, and for bringing them into such action as enables them to produce their best results. It would be a great mistake in any legislator not to shape his measures so as to take advantage of such pre-existing habits and feelings when available. On the other hand, it is an exaggeration to elevate these mere aids and facilities into necessary conditions. People are more easily induced to do, and do more easily, what they are already used to; but people also learn to do things new to them. Familiarity is a great help; but much dwelling on an idea will make it familiar, even when strange at first. There are abundant instances in which a whole people have been eager for untried things. The amount of capacity which a people possess for doing new things, and adapting themselves to new circumstances; is itself one of the elements of the question. It is a quality in which different nations, and different stages of civilization, differ much from one another. The capability of any given people for fulfilling the conditions of a given form of government can not be pronounced on by any sweeping rule. Knowledge of the particular people, and general practical judgment and sagacity, must be the guides.|$|E
