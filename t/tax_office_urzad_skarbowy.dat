40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behavior}} of a tax-collecting government (a <b>tax</b> <b>office)</b> when imposing a quantity-tax to firms is analyzed along a two-period signaling model. Each taxpayer privately knows its technological attributes, while third parties—the <b>tax</b> <b>office</b> among them—have only a prior belief about this fact, so firms can be tempted to behave opportunistically. In monopoly, signaling is always costly in terms of output deviation and the <b>tax</b> <b>office</b> reacts by setting, a smaller tax in (asymmetric information) period 1 than it would under symmetric information. In oligopoly, signaling can be either costly or costless. In the former case, the tax imposed by the <b>tax</b> <b>office</b> to each firm is below that imposed under symmetric information, while it is equal in the latter case. Besides, fiscal revenue under signaling is unambiguously lower than under symmetric information, even when tax size is the same in both contextsOutput-tax, <b>tax</b> <b>office,</b> asymmetric information, signaling...|$|R

40|$|Kristina Murphy {{writes that}} during the 1990 s, Australian taxpayers who {{invested}} in mass marketed tax schemes enjoyed generous tax breaks until the Australian Taxation <b>Office</b> (<b>Tax</b> <b>Office)</b> told them in 1998 that they abused the system. This paper examines {{the circumstances surrounding the}} decision of taxpayers 2 ̆ 7 to invest in scheme arrangements, and investors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the way the <b>Tax</b> <b>Office</b> dealt with the schemes issue. In addition, this paper explores why such a large number of investors have chosen to defy the <b>Tax</b> <b>Office</b> 2 ̆ 7 s demands that they pay back taxes. Data were taken from interviews conducted with 29 scheme investors, and four non-investors, living in the Goldfields region of Western Australia. Consistent with the procedural justice literature, the findings revealed that many scheme investors chose to defy the <b>Tax</b> <b>Office</b> 2 ̆ 7 s request that they pay back tax because they perceived the procedures that the <b>Tax</b> <b>Office</b> used to handle the situation as unfair. The implications of these findings are discussed and possible solutions for how the <b>Tax</b> <b>Office</b> might prevent a reoccurrence of the situation in the future are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to call the {{attention}} of public entities for the econometric frontier models which allows benchmarking the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> accurately. In the context of the European Maastricht, the European countries face public receipts shortage and to focus in the management of the tax agencies in order to maximize receipts. The procedure adopted in this paper allows benchmarking the tax agencies accurately. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts the stochastic frontier model to benchmark the <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> This model is presently very popular in benchmarking exercises, based on its statistical framework. Findings – The paper finds that the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> analysed vary along the sample and along the period. Research limitations/implications – The homogeneity of the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> and the short data set are the main limitations of the paper. Relative to the first, since they are managed by the same entity and perform the same task we can claim that they are similar, relative to the second critic, we cannot overcome it because of the secrecy related to this units. Practical implication – The efficiency rankings are due to the way the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> handle costs and outputs. The way they handle the combination of output and inputs is explained in the literature by the principal-agent relationship, by collective-action problem, due to asymmetric information between different <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> and X-inefficiency. The public policy has to address these problems in order to upgrade the efficiency of the <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> Originality/value – This is the first paper adopting the stochastic frontier model in <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> Decision making, Portugal, Resource efficiency, Stochastic modelling, Taxation...|$|R
