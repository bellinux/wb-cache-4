METHODS We examine the case of implementation of the Sociedade Moçambicana de Medicamentos. Data have been collected using semi-structured interviews (applied to 21 professionals of the Sociedade Moçambicana de Medicamentos, Farmanguinhos, FIOCRUZ, and Itamaraty) and official documents. The data of the interviews have been submitted to content analysis, using the software NVivo. RESULTS Training and <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> directly influenced the acquisition and, partly, the assimilation of knowledge. Expatriation contributed with the transformation of this knowledge from the development and refinement of operational routines. Finally, the definition of standard operating procedures allowed the Mozambican technicians to be the actors of {{the transformation of the}} knowledge previously acquired and assimilated and, at the same time, it laid the foundations for a future exploration of the knowledge. CONCLUSIONS Training and <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> mainly influence the potential absorptive capacity, while expatriation and standard operating procedures most directly affect the realized absorptive capacity...|$|E

Ness pesquisa identificam-se as arenas e os padrões em vigor, as linhas de convergência e d conflito entre os grupos de interesse, a articulação interna e externa das unidade componentes da matriz institucional vigente, elemento que estrutura os movimento estratégicos dos agentes envolvidos. A dissertação indica que as resistências impostas pel atuação de grupos de interesse (públicos e privados), o desenho da matriz institucional, centralização do poder do Presidente da República e o uso político dos fundos de pensão têm imposto grande resistência do modelo de organização estatal, refletindo a ação de mecanismo auto-reforçantes que permitem verificar elementos de trajetória de dependência (pat ependence). Tais aspectos, que são centrais nos comportamentos mantenedores do statu quo, permitem compreender a difícil implementação de mudanças que permitissem um gestão mais moderna e transparente das questões relativas aos fundos de pensão. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis study aims to {{describe}} in what measure {{the process of}} external knowledge acquisition by <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> has been contributing for the institucionalization of external control practices in the Brazilian Court of Accounts (TCU). The <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> accomplished by TCU, in the period from 1998 to 2004, were identified and characterized, {{as well as the}} socialization and code processes related to them. The institucionalization of external control practices linked to those visits were studied by the use of the variables Links, Resources / Structures and Program. Also, was analyzed the Legitimacy of the use of <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> as a way to acquire external knowledge. Theoretical support is found in the studies of the Organizacional Learning, especially the study of learning processes, and in the Institutional Theory, including the institutional isomorphism phenomenon. As research methodology, two stages were accomplished, being the first composed by documental exam and the second by accomplishment of 18 semi-structured interviews with people involved with the <b>technical</b> <b>visits.</b> The results suggest that the accomplishment of <b>technical</b> <b>visits,</b> allied to conversion processes of the acquired knowledge, would have {{an important role in the}} institucionalization of external control practices in TCU, considering an isomorphic context. The interaction among those visits, as process of external knowledge acquisition, and the other code and socialization processes, especially reports elaboration, technical documents publication and trainings, made possible the transfer of learning from individual to organizational level. It was identified direct relation among the establishments of more solid and permanent organizacional links with the institucionalization of practices. In what it refers to the <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> legitimacy, it stands out the presence of Moral Legitimacy, found on the visits evaluation in function of the reached results, and the presence of the Cognitive Legitimacy, by influence of the mimetic isomorphism phenomenon...|$|E

A random sample of thirty-nine establishments participated in the research. The instruments for data collection were pre-tested, and the actual interviews were conducted by trained personnel. Comparative analyses were made using various statistical tests. All of the participating establishments purchase fresh vegetables, although only six of them use minimally processed ones. For most of the establishments, price is {{at least one of the}} most important criteria for the selection of a supplier, and they do not normally monitor the safety of the fresh products purchased (51. 3 %), nor do they make regular <b>technical</b> <b>visits</b> to guarantee quality (46. 2 %); moreover, most do not carry out a supplier development program.

40|$|Currently, {{the issue}} of the {{conscious}} use of water is highlighted in worldwide discussion. This natural resource is consumed inappropriately generating waste and, in most cases, to discharge to the environment outside the minimum standards of acceptance. Great part of the industries need treated water as a resource to be incorporated in their processes, generating waste that should not be left as environmental liabilities, identifying legal action to act and reduce environmental impacts.

The client supplied a large collection of data in order to perform a complete assessment of the area including a full metocean study, geotechnical investigation, breakwater and port facility design, vessel fleet analysis, construction feasibility exercise, port layout of both dry and wet infrastructure, and a physical modelling campaign to test and observe the selected breakwater configuration. In addition, a large variety of software and computational tools were provided, inducing TOMAWAC, Refonde, ROBOT and TALRIN. These programs were taught by visiting guest lectures and support staff at ESITC Caen. The nature and use of these programs in the project will be discussed in the following report.
