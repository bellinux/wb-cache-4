5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged <b>the</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when <b>the</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by <b>the</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
