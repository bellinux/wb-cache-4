Bass guitarist Bryan Beller made the decision to leave the band in support of Keneally, with whom he also played bass guitar in Beer for Dolphins. [...] This proved to be an important decision for both sidemen, as Keneally and Beller have continued to work together on Mike Keneally & Beer For Dolphins/The Mike Keneally Band releases, recording and touring together with guitarist Joe Satriani, in the live Dethklok band, Beller's solo albums View, <b>Thanks</b> <b>In</b> <b>Advance,</b> a live CD & DVD entitled Wednesday Night Live!, his instrumental power trio the Aristocrats along with guitarist Guthrie Govan and drummer Marco Minnemann, recording & touring with guitar virtuoso Steve Vai as well as various other recording and DVD projects, multiple American and European tours, as clinicians for Taylor Guitars, and finally as self-proclaimed musical soulmates.

40|$|Winter {{is a good}} me to plan {{home and}} ranch {{improvement}} projects. Perhaps {{at the top of}} your project list this year is fencing. It could be that you need to reinforce, repair or renovate your exisng fence or maybe you have a new area that needs to be fenced. Fencing is a major expense for livestock managers, and takes considerable me and labor. It is important to plan wisely to achieve the desired results. Objec!ve Where to begin? First, be clear about your objecves. Fencing is designed to keep animals in and o 1 en mes to keep predators out. If this is your goal, choose a fencing system that will do this. It is much easier to select the correct fencing system in the beginning rather than modify it a 1 er it is in place. Important consideraons for a fencing system include: single or mulple species use, budget, maintenance requirements, longevity, safety for people and animals, availability of materials, potenal impact on wildlife, cultural norms and building ordinances or covenants.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few {{elections}} there has been significant discussion among scholars, politicians, and media pundits {{about the ability of}} the presence of social issue ballot measures, such as those relating to gay marriage or abortion, to increase turnout. Recent research on the subject, however, has often treated these ballot measures as separate, individual measures, ignoring a possible cumulative effect. I investigate this possibility by examining the relationship between the total number of social issue measures on the ballot and voter turnout. Employing the Current Population Survey November Voting and Registration Supplement from the past five elections, a unique data set which identifies the nature of ballot measures, and hierarchical generalized linear modeling to account for the multilevel nature of the data, I find that the number of social issue measures present on the ballot had a positive impact on turnout during the past three midterm elections and one of the past two presidential elections. I discuss the implications of these findings in the conclusion. [This is clearly a working draft. I finished the results section and conclusion this weekend, so they have not been revised (I apologize if these sections is painful to read). Some pieces are missing (notably parts of the appendix and the figures for my predicted probabilities), but all of the text is there. I welcome any and all feedback, suggestions, criticisms, praise, or condemnation as I get this paper ready to take to Midwest. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> for reading my paper. ...|$|E
40|$|As we head to Prague next June, I want to {{note and}} {{acknowledge}} {{the hard work}} of all IAEE and affiliate members who organize our conferences. Year in and year out, IAEE conferences continue to advance the field of energy economics and related disciplines, enhance the quality of our organization, and extend and expand the IAEE networks largely through the efforts of the program and local planning committees. This is pure volunteer work- a true expression of service within a service organization. It takes time, energy, perseverance, and patience (and no small amount of guidance and support from our headquarters staff!). The tradition is to offer thanks after the event is over to all of those who made the effort. This year, having been there and done this myself, I want to offer <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> on behalf of the IAEE council and membership, to our fearless leaders in Prague, Jan Myslevic and Ivan Benes, to our HQ staff, and all who are helping them with this wonderful venue. As the Prague agenda has taken shape, I have heard many comments on the meaning and symbolism of having an IAEE event in the Czech Republic, in a region of profound transitions and transformations. For those of us who participated in the 1996 Budapest conference it is a similar feeling of being witnesses to change. For all that {{we are trying to do}} with regard to student outreach, I think it is particularly important to reflect on and communicate these impressions to our younger and future members and leaders. They are the ones who will push the frontiers, both in research and geography, for the IAEE, and we ought to help them see the bigger picture of what IAEE is all about and the roles our members play in their national and local settings. I look forward to seeing you in Prague...|$|E
