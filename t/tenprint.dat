The decision by the Brazilian government to adopt fingerprint-based biometrics was spearheaded by Dr. Felix Pacheco at Rio de Janeiro, at that time capital of the Federative Republic. Dr. Pacheco was a friend of Dr. Juan Vucetich, who invented one of the most complete <b>tenprint</b> classification systems in existence. The Vucetich system was adopted not only in Brazil, but also by most of the other South American countries. The oldest and most traditional ID Institute in Brazil (Instituto de Identificação Félix Pacheco) was integrated at DETRAN (Brazilian equivalent to DMV) into the civil and criminal AFIS system in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Comparing {{a latent}} {{fingerprint}} minutiae {{set against a}} <b>tenprint</b> fingerprint minutiae set using an automated fingerprint identification system is a challenging problem. This is mainly because latent fingerprints obtained from crime scenes are mostly partial fingerprints, and most automated systems expect approximately {{the same number of}} minutiae between query and the reference fingerprint under comparison for good per-formance. In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce the minutiae set of <b>tenprint</b> with respect to that of query latent minutiae set by registering the orientation field of latent fingerprint with the <b>tenprint</b> orientation field. By reducing the search space of minutiae from the <b>tenprint,</b> we can improve the performance of automated identification systems for latent fingerprints. We report the performance of our registration algorithm on the NIST-SD 27 database as well as the improvement in the Rank Identification accuracy of a standard minutiae-based automated system.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} the discriminability of {{fingerprints}} of twins is presented. The fingerprint data used is of high quality and quantity because of a predominantly young subject population of 298 pairs of twins whose <b>tenprints</b> were captured using a livescan device. Discriminability using level 1 and level 2 features is independently reported. The level 1 study was to visually classify by humans each fingerprint into one of six categories (right loop, left loop, whorl, arch, twin loop, and tented arch). It was found that twins {{are much more likely}} (55 %) to have the same level 1 classification when compared to the general population (32 %). The level 2 study was to compare minutiae (ridge endings and bifurcations). This was done by a minutiae-based automatic fingerprint identification algorithm that provided a score (0 - 350) given a pair of fingerprints. Scores were computed for corresponding fingers from both twins and non-twins. Five distributions of scores were determined: twins, non-twins, identical twins, fraternal twins, and genuine scores from the same finger. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare distributions, the following inferences are made: twins are different from genuines, twins are different from non-twins, and identical twins are the same as fraternal twins. The main conclusion is that, although the patterns of minutiae among twins are more similar than in the general population, they are still discriminable...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute of Standards and Technology in {{conjunction}} with the Federal Bureau of Investigation has developed a new database of grayscale fingerprint images and corresponding minutiae data. The database contains latent fingerprints from crime scenes and their matching rolled fingerprint mates. In all there are 258 latent cases. Each case includes the latent image, the matching <b>tenprint</b> image, and four sets of minutiae that have been validated by a professional team of latent examiners. One set of minutiae contains all minutiae points on the latent fingerprint; the second set contains all minutiae points on the <b>tenprint</b> mate; the other two sets contain the minutiae points in common between the latent fingerprint and <b>tenprint</b> mate. In all there are 27, 426 minutiae recorded across the set of tenprints with 5460 minutiae in common with their matching latent fingerprint. All data files are formatted according to the ANSI/NISTITL 1 - 2000 standard using Type- 1, 9, 13, & 14 records. [...] ...|$|E

We have estab- lished ground truths of minutia level correspondences for the publicly available NIST SD 27 data set, whose minutia have been extracted by forensic fingerprint experts. We per- formed verification tests with two publicly available minutia matchers, Bozorth 3 and k-plet, yielding Equal Error Rates of 36 % and 40 % respectively, suggesting that they have sim- ilar (poor) ability to separate a client from an impostor in latent versus <b>tenprint</b> queries. However, in an identifica- tion scenario, we found performance advantage of k-plet over Bozorth 3, suggesting that the former can rank the sim- ilarities of fingerprints better. Regardless of the matcher, the general poor performance is a confirmation of previous findings related to latent vs <b>tenprint</b> matching. A finding influencing future practice is that the minutia level match- ing errors in terms of FA and FR may not be balanced (not equally good) even if FA and FR have been chosen to be so at finger level. © 2012 IEEE.

We report just such an experiment with naive undergraduates using digital scans of real, crime-scene latent prints, and patent prints taken from official, ten-print cards of suspects.

Using the ULW in conjunction with SD 27 poses a powerful and inexpensive training tool for fingerprint examiners. This report documents the steps needed to load SD 27 fingerprint images into ULW, and how trainee results can then be overlaid with the validated minutiae in SD 27.

AFIS do not use all discriminatory features available in fingerprints but typically use only some types of features automatically extracted by a feature extraction algorithm. Latent fingerprints obtained from crime scenes are usually partial in nature which results to only very few number of reliable minutiae. Comparing a partial minutiae pattern to a full minutiae pattern is a difficult problem. Towards solving this challenge, we propose a method that exploits extended fingerprint features (unusual/rare minutiae) not commonly considered in typical minutiae-based matchers. The method we propose in this work can be combined with any existing minutiae-based matcher. We first compute a quantitative measure based on least squares between latent and <b>tenprint</b> minutiae points, with rare minutia feature as reference point. Then the similarity score of the reference minutiae-based matcher is modified based on the least square quantitative measure. The modified similarity score thus obtained incorporates the contribution of rare minutia features. We use a realistic forensic fingerprint casework database in our experiments which contains rare minutia features obtained from Guardia Civil, the Spanish law enforcement agency. Experiments are conducted using two reference minutiae-based matchers, namely: NIST-Bozorth 3 and VeriFinger. We report a significant improvement in the rank identification accuracies when the reference minutiae matchers are augmented with our proposed algorithm based on rare minutia features. I...|$|E
40|$|Biometrics has {{historically}} found its natural mate in Forensics. The first applications {{found in the}} literature and over cited so many times, are related to biometric measurements for the identification of multiple offenders from some of their biometric and anthropometric characteristics (<b>tenprint</b> cards) and individualization of offender from traces found on crime-scenes (e. g. fingermarks, earmarks, bitemarks, DNA). From sir Francis Galton, to the introduction of AFIS systems in the scientific laboratories of police departments, Biometrics and Forensics have been "dating" with alternate results and outcomes. As a matter of facts there are many technologies developed under the "Biometrics umbrella" which may be optimised to better impact several Forensic scenarios and criminal investigations. At the same time, there is an almost endless list of open problems and processes in Forensics which may benefit from the introduction of tailored Biometric technologies. Joining the two disciplines, on a proper scientific ground, may only result in the success for both fields, as well as a tangible benefit for the society. A number of Forensic processes may involve Biometric-related technologies, among them: Evidence evaluation, Forensic investigation, Forensic Intelligence, Surveillance, Forensic ID management and Verification. The COST Action IC 1106 funded by the European Commission, is trying to better understand how Biometric and Forensics synergies can be exploited within a pan-European scientific alliance which extends its scope to partners from USA, China and Australia. Several results have been already accomplished pursuing research in this direction. Notably the studies in 2 D and 3 D face recognition have been gradually applied to the forensic investigation process. In this paper a few solutions will be presented to match 3 D face shapes along with some experimental results...|$|E
