5|$|July 13, 2002– The {{precursor}} disturbance to Tropical Storm Arthur {{moves across}} the Florida Panhandle and produces heavy amounts of precipitation peaking at 4.79inches (122mm) in <b>two</b> <b>locations.</b>|$|E
5|$|After further {{slippage}} in the timescales, {{the opening}} date was revised from late June 2015 to 19 August 2015. The delay was explained as being due to needing to undertake additional work to stabilise the road foundation in <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> {{to make it}} suitable to lay tarmac on. The road finally opened {{on the evening of}} 19 August 2015, costing £20.4M in total, of which Sefton Council funded £5.9M (approximately 30%) of the cost.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper {{were found in}} <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper {{and one of the}} blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{location}} management cost of users moving to and fro between <b>two</b> <b>location</b> areas, a location management strategy based on Dual Location Areas in LEO satellite network is proposed. A combined <b>two</b> <b>location</b> area with satellite location area and Fix Earth Station (FES) location area is designed to divide network coverage area. Users initiate location update procedure when both boundaries of the <b>two</b> <b>location</b> areas are crossed. Based on the Dual Location Areas a corresponding two-step paging strategy is implemented without complicated calculation in order to detect users’ location. Compared with the location management strategy used in Iridium system, simulation results indicate that the strategy decreases location update cost of to-and-fro users and the system paging bandwidth is also saved...|$|R

5|$|Between Cobleskill and Sharon Springs, NY10 {{proceeds}} northwest through rural terrain once more, {{with the}} points of interest limited to {{a small number of}} hamlets. Midway between the <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> in Seward, NY10 intersects NY165, a connector leading to Cooperstown via NY166 and Otsego County's County Route52 (CR52). In Sharon Springs, a village situated in northwest Schoharie County, NY10 intersects US20. Shortly after exiting the village, NY10 passes into Montgomery County.|$|E
5|$|NY10A was a southerly {{alternate}} route of then-NY10 between Long Lake and North Creek, Warren County, via Blue Mountain Lake. While NY10 followed modern NY28N between the <b>two</b> <b>locations,</b> NY10A utilized {{what is now}} NY30 and NY28. It was assigned in the late 1920s and replaced by a realigned NY10 and an extended NY28 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|NY3 was realigned in <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> between Lockport and Rochester. One {{was just}} east of Lockport, where it was {{straightened}} out to go directly from Lockport to Gasport on modern NY31, bypassing McNalls. The other was between Middleport and Medina, where it was realigned to use modern NY31E instead. NY3's old alignment from Lockport to Gasport via McNalls became part of NY77 west of McNalls and NY359 north of the community. Its former routing between Middleport and Medina became NY3A.|$|E

Contrast Ratio in this study was defined as the illumination ratio between the horizontal task surface illumination and vertical illumination looking straight forward at the evaluative point location. The criterion was that CR at these <b>two</b> <b>location</b> points be approximately 3 : 1 or below. This is an accepted metrics within a work space [4]. Referring to Fig.  3 b, Vertical illumination was represented by E(x).|$|R
30|$|In the literature, {{there are}} some {{researchers}} who considered th e problem of location inventory. For instance, Rudi et al. (2001) proposed <b>two</b> <b>location</b> inventory models with transshipment. In these models, effects of transshipments between <b>two</b> independent <b>locations</b> also have been examined. Shen et al. (2003) dealt with a joint location problem, where a single supplier and multiple retailers have been considered.|$|R
5|$|On February 13, 2007, {{the company}} {{announced}} {{that they were looking}} into building a track in Colorado. The 75,000-seat track would be built on one of <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> in Adams County, just east of Denver. The company would also be looking to use the same type of combination of public and private funds for the race track as in Kansas and Washington.|$|E
5|$|Route216 was {{originally}} part of NY39 in the 1920s. The portion of NY39 from Stormville to West Patterson was redesignated {{as part of}} NY52 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, an alternate route of NY52 between Stormville and Towners was assigned the NY216 designation. The alignments of NY52 and NY216 between the <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> were largely swapped in 1937. In 1970, Route216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag.|$|E
5|$|The first NY32A was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the segment of modern NY32 between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville in Saratoga County. At the time, NY32 was routed on what is now US4 between the <b>two</b> <b>locations.</b> The route was supplanted by a realigned NY32 in the early 1940s.|$|E

5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
5|$|To the east, {{a bridge}} {{connected}} Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway {{was built in}} 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge. Currently there are three modern bridges connecting the <b>two</b> <b>locations.</b> Transits between the two islands peaked after {{the construction of the}} Bahrain International Airport in 1932. Ring roads and highways were later built to connect Manama to the villages of the Northern Governorate and towards towns in central and southern Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Bodø/Glimts in 1916 and Grand Bodø the following year, the clubs played at various locations throughout the town. The primary venue for the clubs' elite teams was Bodø Station. By 1962, plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs. The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized by the various sports clubs in town {{in support of the}} municipality building a new venue. <b>Two</b> <b>locations</b> were considered: at Plassmyra, now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum, and at Aspmyra. The latter was chosen and the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Although both {{shows are}} set in the same hospital, the Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to {{encompass}} the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London. As a result, some crossover scenes had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the <b>two</b> <b>locations.</b> McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Its first series ran for nine episodes of 50 minutes in length, which were broadcast first in the 8.10pm, then 8pm timeslot on Tuesdays.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{his formal}} education, Hašek stands out among Czech sportsmen. He earned a {{university}} degree after studying {{history and the}} Czech language in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hradec Králové, which qualified {{him to be a}} teacher, and led him to teach high school classes. Hašek also has a brand of sportswear named Dominator Clothing, which was launched shortly after the Nagano Olympics in 1998. It also had <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> in Michigan for a short time. Unfortunately, sales was short, and Dominator brand was forced to end in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, {{the piece}} of current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the <b>two</b> <b>locations</b> was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel Genetic Algorithm based Artificial Intelligent {{approach}} {{to solve a}} variation of traveling salesperson problem. The task {{is to find the}} least congested path(s) between <b>two</b> <b>location</b> vertices. In real world, the congestion or traffic data between <b>two</b> <b>location</b> vertices is very dynamic. This problem becomes particularly interesting in the field of location services, or Telematics, where one activity is to use real time spatial data to suggest optimal route for its subscribers. A web based software prototype is developed using proprietary components that implements the suggested Genetic Algorithm engine to analyze and confirm the validity of the new approach. A simulation of Dhaka’s dynamic and unpredictable traffic congestion scenario has been used in the prototype...|$|R

5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again {{seen in the}} run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the <b>two</b> <b>locations,</b> but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route22, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} was initially {{split into two}} segments. The northern half of the route ran from Riparius to Rouses Point and mostly followed what is now US9 between the <b>two</b> <b>locations.</b> From Elizabethtown to Keeseville, however, Route22 followed a more westerly alignment via Keene, Jay, and Au Sable Forks. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route22 north of Riparius became part of NY6, which continued south toward Glens Falls on what is now US9. At the same time, the section of modern NY9N between Saratoga Springs and Lake George was designated as part of NY10. The portion between Ticonderoga and Westport became part of a realigned NY30 by the following year.|$|E
