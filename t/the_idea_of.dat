Elves would also visit children {{at night and}} comfort them {{if they had been}} chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E

5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies.

50|$|Colorado Rocky Mountain School {{was founded}} in 1953 by John and Anne Holden, former faculty at the Putney School in Vermont. The school was envisioned as an {{expansion}} on <b>the</b> educational <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Carmelita Hinton at Putney. In addition to Hinton, the Holdens drew strongly upon <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Kurt Hahn and John Dewey. The school's location in western Colorado facilitated experimentation as well as necessitating practical adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> its eastern U.S and European-based influences.|$|R
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union {{in the early stages}} of the Cold War.|$|E
