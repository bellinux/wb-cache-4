25|$|<b>Texture</b> mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface <b>texture,</b> or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A <b>texture</b> map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one <b>texture</b> at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output <b>texture),</b> and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing <b>texture</b> definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of <b>texture</b> coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as <b>texture</b> coordinates. <b>Texture</b> mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a <b>texture</b> to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research on {{temporal}} <b>textures</b> has concerned mainly modeling, synthesis and detection, but {{not finding}} changes between different temporal <b>textures.</b> Shot change detection, based on appearance, has received much research attention, but detection of changes between temporal <b>textures</b> {{has not been}} addressed sufficiently. Successive temporal <b>textures</b> in a video often have a similar appearance but different motion, a change that shot change detection cannot discern. In this paper, changes between temporal <b>textures</b> are captured by deriving a non-parametric statistical model for the motions via a novel approach, based on properties of the Fourier transform. Motion statistics are used in a sequential change detection test to find changes in the motion distributions, and consequently the temporal <b>textures.</b> Experiments use {{a wide range of}} videos of temporal <b>textures,</b> groups of people, traffic. The proposed approach leads to correct change detection, at a low computational cost. ...|$|R
