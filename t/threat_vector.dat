50|$|There {{are many}} <b>threat</b> <b>vectors</b> {{to a modern}} SCADA system. One is the threat of {{unauthorized}} access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting SCADA devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of cryptographic security, allowing an attacker to control a SCADA device by sending commands over a network. In many cases SCADA users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network jacks and switches. Industrial control vendors suggest approaching SCADA security like Information Security with a defense in depth strategy that leverages common IT practices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{presence}} of large pools of compromised com-puters, {{also known as}} botnets, or zombie armies, represents a very serious threat to Internet security. This paper describes the architecture of a contemporary advanced bot commonly known as Asprox. Asprox {{is a type of}} malware that combines the two <b>threat</b> <b>vectors</b> of forming a botnet and of generating SQL injection attacks. The main features of the Asprox botnet are the use of centralized command and control structure, HTTP based communication, use of advanced double fast-flux service networks, use of SQL injection attacks for recruiting new bots and social engineering tricks to spread malware binaries. The objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to a deeper understanding of Asprox in particular and a better understanding of modern botnet designs in general. This knowledge can be used to develop more effective methods for detecting botnets, and stopping the spreading of botnets on the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Network {{steganography}} {{has been}} a well-known covert data channeling method for over three decades. The basic set of techniques and implementation tools have not changed significantly since their introduction in the early 1980 's. In this paper, we review the predominant methods of classical network steganography, describing the detailed operations and resultant challenges involved in embedding data in the network transport domain. We also consider the various cyber <b>threat</b> <b>vectors</b> of network steganography and point out the major differences between classical network steganography and the widely known end-point multimedia embedding techniques, which focus exclusively on static data modification for data hiding. We then challenge the security community by introducing an entirely new network dat hiding methodology, which we refer to as real-time network data steganography. Finally we provide the groundwork for this fundamental change of covert network data embedding by forming a basic framework for real-time network data operations that will open the path for even further advances in computer network security.

So when Clancy was looking for a new co-author, Greaney found out that his editor at Berkley Books was also Clancy's editor at G. P. Putnam's Sons. His editor later referred to his agent, who asked Greaney to be Clancy's co-author. Commenting on the experience, Greaney recalled: [...] "I wish I could say I was excited, but the truth is, I was terrified. After I caught my breath, I offered to 'try out' because there were some other authors also in the running. I wrote twenty-five pages, handed them in and soon thereafter, I was in Baltimore meeting with Tom Clancy."

40|$|Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are jeopardized {{from a large}} set of <b>threat</b> <b>vectors,</b> which exploit their {{vulnerabilities}} {{in order}} to impact the physical Critical Infrastructures they control. The Information Technology (IT) classical approach to cyber attacks can not be applied to ICS due to their extreme differences from main priorities to resource constrains. Therefore, innovative approaches and equipment must be developed in order to suit with ICS world. In this paper, a Smart Behavioural Filter (SBF) for the PLCs/RTUs is proposed aiming to secure the PLC/RTU itself against logic attacks, that are stealth for other more classical security approaches. Those logic attacks are usually anomaly behaviours, for instance {{a large number of}} open/close commands towards a valve. This smart field equipment can communicate with other equipment like itself in order to react in short time to cyber attacks and increase the resilience of the physical system. It can also generate alarms for the local Intrusion Detection System (IDS) The proposed equipment has been developed and validated in a real test-bed within the FP 7 CockpitCI project.

40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} empowers {{network operators}} with more flexibility to program their networks. With SDN, network management moves from codifying functionality {{in terms of}} low-level device configurations to building software that facilitates network management and debugging. By separating the complexity of state distribution from network specification, SDN provides new ways to solve long-standing problems in networking — routing, for instance — while simultaneously allowing the use of security and dependability techniques, such as access control or multi-path. However, the security and dependability of the SDN itself is still an open issue. In this position paper we argue for the need to build secure and dependable SDNs by design. As {{a first step in}} this direction we describe several <b>threat</b> <b>vectors</b> that may enable the exploit of SDN vulnerabilities. We then sketch the design of a secure and dependable SDN control platform as a materialization of the concept here advocated. We hope that this paper will trigger discussions in the SDN community around these issues and serve as a catalyser to join efforts from the networking and security & dependability communities in the ultimate goal of building resilient control planes...|$|R
