40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{the optimal}} process {{conditions}} in <b>the</b> physically <b>refined</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> have been determined. The oils {{involved in this}} analysis were Palm Oil (PO), and Palm Kernel Oil (PKO). The oils, obtained from a local market in Enugu, North – East province of Nigeria, were characterized {{with a view to}} finding the ordinary values of the variables that were optimized, especially in the degumming, bleaching, and deodorization sections, as well as <b>the</b> cost of <b>refining</b> and <b>the</b> revenue accruable from the sale of the products. The AOCS method of AOCS, [1], was used in the analysis. Graphical method of linear programming and Sinplex Alogrithm methods were also used in order to optimize the variables. The objectives and the constraints were formulated into standard models with temperature, pressure, chemical concentration and clay dosage as the variables. It was found that optimal values of phosphotide in <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> <b>oils,</b> measured as Phosphorous, were 0. 0105 and 0. 0047 Ppm; Colour pigment, measured in Red Units, 1. 92 and 1. 35, for PO and PKO, respectively, and odour, measured as FFA, was 0. 1 and 0. 05 %, accordingly. The optimal cost of refining which was analysed using Simplex Alogrithm, gave N 583. 95 and 676. 24 per tones, each of the PO and PKO. Optimal revenue was obtained as N 106, 400 and N 128, 700, per tone of <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> <b>oils.</b> Based on <b>the</b> optimized cost, while profit accruable per 100 tones of <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> raw <b>oils,</b> based on the sale of the products was N 1, 399, 344 and N 2, 106825 for PO and PKO respectively.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} high oil prices set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008–09, Iranian oil {{accounted}} for nearly 16.5% of India's crude oil imports. Indian oil imports from Iran increased by 9.5% in 2008–09 due to which Iran emerged as India's second largest oil supplier. About 40% of <b>the</b> <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> consumed by India is imported from Iran. In June 2009, Indian oil companies announced their plan to invest US$5 billion in developing an Iranian gas {{field in the}} Persian Gulf. In September 2009, the Mehr news agency reported a Pakistani diplomat as saying [...] "India definitely quitted the IPI (India-Pakistan-Iran) gas pipeline deal", in favour of Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement for energy security. Iranian officials however said India is yet to make an official declaration. In 2010, US officials warned New Delhi that Indian companies using the Asian Clearing Union for financial transactions with Iran {{run the risk of}} violating a recent US law that bans international firms from doing business with Iranian banks and Tehran's oil and gas sector, and that Indian companies dealing with Iran in this manner may be barred from the US. The United States criticises the ACU of being insufficiently transparent in its financial dealings with Iran and suspects that much of their assets are funnelled to blacklisted repressive organisations in Iran such as the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. The United States Department of the Treasury also believes that Iran uses the ACU to bypass the US banking system. On 27 November 2010, the Indian government, through the Reserve Bank of India, instructed the country's lenders to stop processing current-account transactions with Iran using the Asian Clearing Union, and that further deals should be settled without ACU involvement. RBI also declared that they will not facilitate payments for Iranian crude imports as global pressure on Tehran grows over its nuclear programme. This move by the Indian government will make clear to Indian companies that working through the ACU [...] "doesn't necessarily mean an Iranian counterpart has an international seal of approval". As of December 2010, neither Iran nor the ACU have responded to this development. India objected to further American sanctions on Iran in 2010. An Indian foreign policy strategist, Rajiv Sikri, dismissed the idea that a nuclear armed Iran was a threat to India, and said that India would continue to invest in Iran and do business. Despite increased pressure by the US and Europe, and a significant reduction in oil imports from Persian oil fields in 2012, leading political figures in India have clearly stated that they are not willing to stop trade relations altogether. To the contrary, they aim at expanding the commodity trade with the Islamic republic.|$|E
