5|$|Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{launched}} an appeal, and Thornton was rearrested.

5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E
5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{pointed to}} the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|The court decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> against Thornton was not overwhelming, {{and that}} trial by battle was a {{permissible}} option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle. Ashford declined {{the offer of}} battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished by statute in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} trial by battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E

50|$|This {{theory was}} given by Thimann (1951) and Kramer (1959). According to the theory, {{sometimes}} water is absorbed against a concentration gradient.

In conclusion, it is said <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences</b> supporting active absorption of water are themselves poor.|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E

When the agents visit Ariel and Jacob, their request for the exhumation of Isaac's body angers the old man.|$|E
5|$|Without any {{discussion}} of the merits, 5-4, the Court held that the indictment stated offenses under § 1782 and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> was sufficient for the jury to have convicted Burton.

5|$|American {{officials}} later acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{cited by}} the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{received}} {{a request to}} reopen {{the investigation into the}} accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot from New England who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.|$|E

5|$|Nickell {{continued}} {{to maintain her}} innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury-tampering and judicial misconduct issues {{was rejected by the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001 was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. She claimed that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell's involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though it is clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E

They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
