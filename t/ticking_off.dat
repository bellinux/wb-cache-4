5|$|Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost {{a fumble}} {{for the first}} time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee {{possession}} at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> the final seconds and Tennessee out of time outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left. This set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke through the line. He blocked Lincoln's field goal as time expired, preserving Alabama's 12–10 victory and perfect season. For their performances, Cody was named the SEC Defensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{children}} first master counting. When given {{a problem that}} requires that two items and three items be combined, young children model the situation with physical objects, often fingers or a drawing, and then count the total. As they gain experience, they learn or discover the strategy of [...] "counting-on": asked to find two plus three, children count three past two, saying [...] "three, four, five" [...] (usually <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> fingers), and arriving at five. This strategy seems almost universal; children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers. Most discover it independently. With additional experience, children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number, in this case starting with three and counting [...] "four, five." [...] Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts ("number bonds"), either through experience or rote memorization. Once some facts are committed to memory, children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones. For example, a child asked to add six and seven may know that [...] and then reason that [...] is one more, or 13. Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently.|$|E
2500|$|A {{near-identical}} {{play in a}} 1999 collegiate game {{allowed the}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) to steal a victory from Baylor. With the final seconds <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> the clock, Baylor had a 24–21 lead and possession of the football near the UNLV goal line. [...] With UNLV out of timeouts, only a kneeldown was necessary. However, {{instead of trying to}} run out the clock, Baylor elected to try for a touchdown in an attempt to run up the final score. Baylor running back Darryl Bush fumbled while trying to punch his way into the end zone, and UNLV's Kevin Thomas picked up the loose football and went 99 yards for the game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{critics who}} {{accepted}} {{the premise of}} the show and the legitimacy of motorcycles under the Guggenheim's roof, since museums have included design exhibitions before, and shown, for example, utilitarian bowls or ancient chariots as art, many still had misgivings about {{the way in which it}} was financed. While appreciative of Thomas Krens' innovative museum direction, The New York Times mused that, [...] "one can't help wondering which came first, the idea for the exhibition or the realization that money [...] would be available for such a show." [...] A number of times the Guggenheim answered critics of BMW's involvement by <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> the total number of Harley-Davidsons and Hondas, which were greater than BMWs included. [...] But it was suggested that even at that, there were BMWs shown that were not significant enough to be present.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the play {{has also been}} criticised for some hints of anti-Semitism, {{specifically}} [...] "the disparaging remarks made about moneylenders, who were often Jewish." [...] It {{is true that the}} moneylender Moses is portrayed in a comparatively positive light, but the way he is described (as a [...] "friendly Jew" [...] and an [...] "honest Israelite" [...] by Rowley in III.1) suggest that he is in some way to be considered an exception to Jews in general; also, his own usurious business practices as stated to Sir Peter are clearly less than exemplary (e.g., his statement [...] "If he appears not very anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent; but if you find him in great distress, and want the moneys very bad, you may ask double" [...] ). It may be significant that in Johann Zoffany's portrait of Robert Baddeley as Moses, we find that [...] "Under his arm Moses holds a rolled parchment of the Surface family tree that is used as an auction hammer, and he seems to be <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> pictures in the catalogue", although in the play Careless is the auctioneer in the relevant scene (IV.1) and Moses has a relatively minor role.|$|E
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E

6000|$|There are many, {{and some}} very curious, methods of seeing India.

60|$|But {{the master}} of the brig sitting with both his elbows on the table, his face in his hands, had fallen {{unexpectedly}} into a meditation so concentrated and so profound that he seemed neither to hear, see, nor breathe. The sight of that man's complete absorption in thought was to Carter almost more surprising than any other occurrence of that night. Had his strange host vanished suddenly from before his eyes, it could not have made him feel more uncomfortably alone in that cabin where the pertinacious clock kept <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> the useless minutes of the calm before it would, with the same steady beat, begin to measure the aimless disturbance of the storm.|$|E
60|$|Karain's tone {{had been}} getting lower and lower, {{as though he}} had been going away from us, till the last words sounded faint but clear, as if shouted on a calm day from a very great distance. He moved not. He stared fixedly past the {{motionless}} head of Hollis, who faced him, as still as himself. Jackson had turned sideways, and with elbow on the table shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand. And I looked on, surprised and moved; I looked at that man, loyal to a vision, betrayed by his dream, spurned by his illusion, and coming to us unbelievers for help--against a thought. The silence was profound; but it seemed full of noiseless phantoms, of things sorrowful, shadowy, and mute, in whose invisible presence the firm, pulsating beat of the two ship's chronometers <b>ticking</b> <b>off</b> steadily the seconds of Greenwich Time seemed to me a protection and a relief. Karain stared stonily; and looking at his rigid figure, I thought of his wanderings, of that obscure Odyssey of revenge, of all the men that wander amongst illusions faithful, faithless; of the illusions that give joy, that give sorrow, that give pain, that give peace; of the invincible illusions that can make life and death appear serene, inspiring, tormented, or ignoble.|$|E
