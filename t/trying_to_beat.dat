5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> him to the ball, {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against Vitesse, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute. He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E

Their remix of the song has an extended intro lasting 90 seconds with the rappers singing [...] "dirty" [...] bars. Reviewers were critical of Rhymes' contribution to the remix, with Spins Marc Hogan calling it [...] "conventionally porny", and Hayden Manders of Refinery29 suggesting it [...] "take the tease of the original's writing {{and turn it into}} sleaze." [...] Banks' effort was contrastingly hailed for [...] "delivering the ratatat wordplay that brought her to acclaim while wisely avoiding <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> either of the track's other artists for sheer bawdiness" [...] by Hogan and [...] "working perfectly with the deep, subdued beat of Beyoncé's original" [...] by Carolyn Menyes from the website Music Times.|$|E

Jeannie races into the house as their mother talks to their father about her {{behavior}} today. Jeannie discovers Rooney threatening Ferris, and has a change of heart; she tells {{him that she was}} just helping to return Ferris from the hospital, and shows Rooney his wallet that she had found from his earlier break-in attempts. Rooney flees while Ferris thanks Jeannie and rushes back to his bedroom to greet his parents while feigning his waning illness. As they leave, Ferris reminds the audience, [...] "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat.</b> That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
500|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy the {{structures}} at bargain prices, provided they move them out of town. For many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor's fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community.|$|E

Heilmann had to have his collarbone rebroken and reset, and it was then discovered that Heilmann had also broken his shoulder. The injuries were so severe that Heilmann remained hospitalized until a week {{before the end of the}} season, and even after leaving the hospital, he feared he might never play again. Despite missing the last five weeks of the season, Heilmann hit a career high 21 home runs, fourth in the American League, and also ranked among the league leaders with a [...]356 batting average (fourth), a [...]432 on-base percentage (fifth) and a [...]598 slugging percentage (fourth).|$|E
2500|$|The 1999 Bourbonnais, Illinois, train {{crash was}} a train-truck {{collision}} between Amtrak's southbound City of New Orleans passenger train and a semi {{truck in the}} village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, near the city of Kankakee. [...] Most of the train derailed, killing 11 people. [...] A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the accident attributed the cause to the truck driver <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the train across a grade crossing. [...] However, the Illinois State Police investigation found track circuit malfunction as the cause. [...] The NTSB's recommendations from the accident included increased enforcement of grade crossing signals, the installation of train event recorders at all new or improved grade crossings, and procedures to provide emergency responders with accurate lists of all crew members and passengers aboard trains. [...] The city of Bourbonnais erected a memorial near the site to commemorate those killed in the accident.|$|E

Born in New Jersey, Ellin made his home in Ladson, South Carolina, near Charleston, and was a touring professional player in the 1990s. He was killed on June 14, 2000, at age 34, when his 1999 Cadillac collided with a locomotive less than a block from his home. Ellin was alone in his car when the accident occurred. Lt. Mike Benton, a Charleston County sheriff, said Ellin was [...] "apparently <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the train to the crossing." [...] Ellin had played in the Sand Regency Open just days before his death. He was survived by wife Shelby, and daughter Ashley Annette who was just 3 {{years old at the time}} of his death. Later that year a Tony Ellin memorial tournament was held at Brass Tap and Billiards in Raleigh, North Carolina, with receipts to benefit the Ashley Ellin Scholarship Fund, which was formed to benefit Ellin's daughter after his death.|$|E

Wooding-up was immediately ceased and Hazelton pulled into the stream as Mount Royal approached and they raced bow to bow. Slowly Mount Royal gained on Hazelton.

2500|$|Game {{three of}} the 1980 NLCS was a classic {{pitching}} duel and somewhat typical of the Astrodome. [...] The Astrodome was a pitchers' park and the Astros teams of the time were built on good pitching, solid defense and geared to stealing bases and scrapping out runs. [...] If the Astros could score just one run, their chances of beating the other team were good. [...] Thus was the case when Joe Niekro got the call in game three facing Larry Christenson of the Phillies. [...] Both teams went scoreless through nine innings. [...] Christenson would pitch six good innings for the Phillies, but Niekro would go ten. [...] Dave Smith {{came out in the}} eleventh to hold the Phillies back. [...] Tug McGraw who had entered the game in the eighth faced Morgan {{in the bottom of the}} eleventh who had a lead off tripled over McBride to start the inning. [...] Manager Bill Virdon would replace Morgan with Landestoy to pinch run. [...] Denny Walling gave Houston a 21 series lead when he hit a fly ball, scoring Landestoy. [...] The Astros won the game, but not without paying a hefty price. [...] In the sixth inning César Cedeño was lost for the remainder of the playoffs when he dislocated his ankle <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> out a double-play ball. [...] In addition Morgan was infuriated with Virdon for pulling him for pinch runner Landestoy creating a personal rift that would result in Morgan leaving the Astros at season's end.|$|E
