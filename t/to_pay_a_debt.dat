25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt,</b> Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not have remembered that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's failure to recognize Powell by asserting she could not see well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E
500|$|Born in Birmingham, {{he was the}} son of a Birmingham {{manufacturer}} of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. [...] By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. [...] At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.|$|E

In this later case he says that [...] "as a remedy against future sin, the satisfaction of one does not profit another, for the flesh of one man is not tamed by another's fast" [...] and again [...] "one man is not freed from guilt by another's contrition." [...] According to Aquinas [...] "Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins." [...] The penance Christ did has its effect in paying the [...] "debt of punishment" [...] incurred by our sin.|$|E

2500|$|Hall {{moved around}} {{throughout}} his career, but probably {{spent most of}} his life in Tavistock, Devon, practising medicine. [...] In 1785, he published The Family Medical Instructor, a medical reference book. [...] Thereafter, his publications were primarily economic in nature. [...] In 1805, he published his principal work, The Effects of Civilization, followed by Observations on the Principal Conclusion in Mr. Malthus's Essay on Population in 1813. [...] In 1816, Hall was arrested for failure <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> of £157, and he spent the next nine years in the Fleet Prison, before being released on 21 June 1825. [...] While the exact date of his death is uncertain, it is believed that he died shortly thereafter.|$|E

[...] In the 1894 court proceeding, Weber Jr. admitted that he had been sued [...] "about seventy-five times" [...] for failing to pay his debts.|$|E
2500|$|Once the United States won its {{independence}} {{and no longer}} had the protection of Britain, it was faced with the task of protecting its own ships and interests. There were few American ships capable of defending the American coastline, much less of protecting merchant ships at sea and abroad. [...] The few warships that were available were converted into merchant ships. The French in particular were outraged that America was still involved in trading with Britain, a country with whom they were at war, and because of American refusal <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> that was owed to the French crown, which had just been overthrown by the newly established French Republic. As a result, France began intercepting American ships that were involved in trading with Britain. This provocation prompted President Adams to appoint Benjamin Stoddert as the first Secretary of the Navy. Stoddert immediately ordered his senior commanders to [...] "subdue, seize and take any armed vessel or vessels sailing under the authority or pretense of authority, from the French Republic." [...] At this time, moreover, America was not even ranked with European naval forces.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps, too, {{it was his}} {{intention}} to visit Rome; but while at Ostia he became involved in a quarrel with the bishop that resided there, which led him at length to leave Ostia abruptly, and to refuse to go to Rome. The cause of the quarrel was the bishop's asking him to pay some money that he owed the Pope. In all the Catholic countries of Europe, in those days, there were certain taxes and fees that were collected for the Pope, the income from which was of great importance in making up the papal revenues. Now Richard, in his eagerness to secure all the money he could obtain in England to supply his wants for the crusade, had appropriated to his own use certain of these church funds, and the bishop now called upon him to reimburse them. This application, as might have been expected, made Richard extremely angry. He assailed the bishop with the most violent and abusive language, and charged all sorts of corruption and wickedness against the papal government itself. These charges may have been true, but the occasion of being called upon <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> was not the proper time for making them. To make the faults or misconduct of others, whether real or pretended, an excuse for not rendering them their just dues, is a very base proceeding.|$|E
