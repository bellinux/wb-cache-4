25|$|This {{was perhaps}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> game played during the series. In the game, a large box was revealed, {{and without any}} clues or hints whatsoever, Bungalow Heads had to draw {{what they thought was}} in the box.

25|$|In 2002, Sinclair scored <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> {{of his own}} goals. After 3 {{minutes into}} a game at Middlesbrough, he coolly slotted the ball past keeper Ian Walker in a {{seemingly}} laid-back situation. This resulted in a 1–0 defeat for Leicester. This own goal against Middlesbrough {{was not to be}} his last for the club. In March 2004, Sinclair and his Leicester City teammates, Paul Dickov and Keith Gillespie were arrested in Spain over sexual assault charges, while on a training holiday. The charges were later dropped. Leicester released Sinclair {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|The first {{objective}} of the AFDL was the clearing of the string of rebel camps along the Rwandan border, {{setting the stage for}} what has been called one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> and macabre situations of modern times. As the AFDL captured a series of Kivutian border towns in November 1996, the Hutu militants herded the refugees into Mugungu, creating a teeming mass of around half a million people who were prohibited from returning across the border by Hutu forces arrayed facing the border. The Hutu resistance was broken after the RPF swung southwest and flanked the Hutu force. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled back into Rwanda as the aid organizations and foreign countries stood impotent to affect the course of events.|$|E

GameDaily named Oro <b>the</b> 22nd <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> fighting game character.|$|R
25|$|The Cardinals {{followed}} with wins in Games 3 and 4, including another victory by Bob Gibson over Denny McLain in Game 4. Lou Brock stole three bases in Game 3 and had six steals {{in the first}} three games. In Game 4, McLain pitched poorly, giving up six runs in three innings. Game 4 also saw one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> strategic battles in World Series history. The Cardinals led 4–0 in the third inning, when the game was delayed by rain for over an hour. When play resumed, the Tigers began to stall, hoping to have the game called before it became official. The Cardinals responded by intentionally trying to make outs to move the game forward. As a result of the tactics, Game 4 of the 1968 series was criticized as one of the worst games in World Series history.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Rudd won {{his only}} {{race of the}} year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of {{controversy}} in one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd drove up to second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line he waved to his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down {{to the middle of the}} ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E
25|$|As a {{synthesizer}} {{and electric}} keyboard player, Sun Ra ranks among one of <b>the</b> earliest and <b>most</b> radical pioneers. By the mid-1950s, {{he used a}} variety of electric keyboards, and almost immediately, he exploited their potential perhaps more than anyone, sometimes modifying them himself to produce sounds rarely if ever heard before. His live albums from the late 1960s and early 1970s feature some of <b>the</b> noisiest, <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> keyboard work ever recorded.|$|R
5000|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{described}} the concert at Webster Hall as [...] "an elaborately synthetic production that flaunted technology but conjured emotion".

500|$|The game {{included}} one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> plays {{of the football}} season. ASU’s Rudy Carpenter fumbled the ball as ASU was close to scoring a touchdown. Chris Jessee, {{a member of the}} Longhorns football operations staff and Mack Brown’s stepson, stepped onto the field and {{may or may not have}} touched the ball as it bounced near the sideline. [...] The ball was recovered by Texas, seemingly preventing an ASU touchdown. [...] However, after a twelve‑minute review, the officials awarded the ball to Arizona State; the Sun Devils scored a touchdown on the next play.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Kramer later gave great {{credit to}} Page {{for the sound}} that was achieved, despite the {{inconsistent}} conditions {{in which it was}} recorded: [...] "We did that album piece-meal. We cut some of the tracks in some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> studios you can imagine, little holes in the wall. Cheap studios. But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous. There was a unification of sound on [...] Zeppelin II because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page." [...] Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A Studios.|$|E
500|$|Mavis has {{remained}} a popular and well-loved character. In 2010, thirteenyears after her departure, Darren Fitzgerald wrote in The Sentinel (Stoke-on-Trent) {{that he wanted to}} see Mavis return to the serial and that he would have written out half of the cast and brought her back as a replacement. But Mavis has also been criticised: Jack Kibble-White, writing for MSN, called Mavis and Derek a [...] "pathetic couple", suggesting that their gnome plot was one of <b>the</b> serial's <b>most</b> <b>bizarre.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Otherkin {{have been}} called one of <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> subcultures, and a {{religious}} movement (and a [...] "quasi-religion") that [...] "in some of its forms, largely only exists on the Internet". Although otherkin beliefs deviate from the definition of [...] "religion", they share the primary interest in the paranormal. Religion scholar Joseph P. Laycock argues that the otherkin community serves existential and social functions commonly associated with religion, and regards it as an alternative nomos that sustains alternate ontologies.|$|R

500|$|Writing for the Radio Times, Mark Braxton {{was less}} enamoured {{of some of}} the performances, {{suggesting}} that Baron and Valentine Dyall turn in 'hammy' interpretations of their characters, while Leee John [...] "...makes heavy weather of the simplest activities: helming the ship seems to require <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> posturing." [...] He had mixed views on the story as a whole, saying that [...] "Enlightenment has promising components that come together and briefly create a little magic, then vanish again, like ships that pass in the night." [...] DVD Talk's John Sinnott had similarly mixed views on the serial, although conceding that [...] "...While it doesn't all succeed, they give it a good try and more things work than don't." [...] Sinnott also singled out the performance of Keith Barron for particular praise, along with the relationship between Marriner and Tegan.|$|E
500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB.

[...] "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case." [...] The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her. In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he wondered why the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was [...] "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety." ...|$|E

500|$|Insane Clown President was {{positively}} reviewed by Publishers Weekly, which called it [...] "equal parts entertaining and enlightening". Kirkus Reviews {{pointed out the}} author's lack of pretense for objectivity, and concluded, [...] " [...] lively set of dispatches that shows how even the harshest skeptic in the pundit class can be blindsided." [...] San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign". The New York Times criticized the work for its lack of moderation. The Daily Beast characterized it as [...] "raucous, trenchant, knee-slapping". Adelaide Review said it was, [...] "one of the finest exponents of polemic journalism". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette criticized the book for not delving deeply into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

500|$|Comics scholar Jeet Heer called Rarebit Fiend [...] "perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> {{newspaper}} {{feature in}} American history". [...] Merkl notes {{examples of the}} strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another woman out a window, as in Luis Buñuel's film L'Age d'Or (1930); and giant characters let loose in the big city, climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in King Kong (1933). [...] Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child's bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 Ray Bradbury story [...] "The Veldt", and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a stretchable face, to Salvador Dalí's surrealist painting Soft self-portrait with fried bacon (1941) and the cosmetic surgeries in Terry Gilliam's Brazil. [...] Stephen R. Bissette compares a strip featuring elevators flying from buildings and other scenes to the 2005 Tim Burton take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.|$|E
500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us {{as long as we have}} our present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>bizarre</b> scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E
