The characterization results show that the NZ 01 is mainly composed of clinoptilolite, quartz and plagioclase and has the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of 64 cmol/kg. Batch adsorption results show that the best ammonia removal was at pH close to that of the natural water (= pH 7). The increase in initial ammonium nitrogen concentration from 5 to 50 ppm resulted in an increase of the adsorption capacity from 0. 64 to 15. 1 mg NH 4 +-N/g. The Jar test experiments indicate the introduction of the NZ 01 enhanced the ammonium removal efficiency.

40|$|A {{variety of}} traumas and {{diseases}} can cause {{peripheral nerve injury}} (PNI). In the process of spontaneous healing, Schwann cells (SC) are very important players. They not only reconstitute myelin, essential for proper nerve function, but also organize themselves into columns that lie within the endoneurial tubes to guide and support axonal regeneration from the proximal to the distal end of the injury. By contrast, large gap PNI requires artificial bridging strategies such as highly aligned scaffolds to promote directed neurite outgrowth. In the field of neural tissue engineering, hydrogels are very attractive biomaterials to encapsulate cells. Their high water content facilitates transport of oxygen, nutrients and waste and their viscoelastic properties can be relatively easy modulated. Recently, a new technique has been developed to efficiently and reproducibly align cells in a collagen type I hydrogel, thereby mimicking the environment required for nerve regeneration. This Engineered Neural Tissue (ENT) has given promising preliminary results with immortalized and primary rat SC both in vitro and in vivo. However, the use of human cells would be a significant advance in bringing <b>this</b> <b>ENT</b> from bench to bedside. Since autologous SC must be harvested from another peripheral nerve and are slowly growing in vitro, {{there is a high}} need for alternative cell types such as human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC). hDPSC can be easily isolated from discarded teeth with very little ethical issues and their neural crest origin suggests a predisposition to differentiate into neural or glial cells. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory indicate the two-dimensional (2 D) in vitro transdifferentiation capacity of human DPSC (hPDSC) into Schwann-like cells (SC-hDPSC). Here, we evaluate the potential of SC-hDPSC to align within a collagen type I hydrogel and determine the effects of <b>this</b> <b>ENT</b> on dorsal root ganglion neuron neurite outgrowth in vitro. ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhthalate {{acid esters}} (PAEs) which are mainly {{anthropogenic}} molecules with endocrine disrupting effects in animals and humans, {{have been detected}} in terrestrial and aquatic environments. However, {{little is known about}} their distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, mainly because of analytical difficulties and the high possibility of ambient sample contamination. Here, we report the optimization of an existing protocol for the determination of PAEs in seawater and freshwater samples, as well as the first estimation of the source and distribution of phthalates acid esters (PAEs) in coastal waters from the NW Mediterranean Sea. By passing 1 L of sample through glass cartridges packed with 200 mg of Oasis HLB and eluted with 6 mL of ethyl acetate followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) analyses, the recoveries for DMP, DEP, DPP, DiBP, DnBP, BzBP, DEHP and DnOP were 101, 98, 115, 110, 99, 98, 103 and 95 %, respectively, with acceptable blank values (below 0. 4 – 4. 0 % of the masses mea- sured in different seawater samples). By using this method, we detected PAEs in the Marseilles coastal area, offshore (2000 m depth) and in the Rhone River with total concentrations ranging from 75. 3 ng/L offshore in surface water to 1207. 1 ng/L a few meters above the bottom of the Marseilles Bay. High con- centrations were also observed in deep waters offshore (310. 2 ng/L) {{as well as in the}} Rhone River (615. 1 ng/L). These results suggest that Marseilles urban area, Rhone River and sediment are potential sources of PAEs in the areas studied. In the Rhone River, DEHP was the most abundant PAE (66. 1 %) followed by DiBP (20. 5 %) and DnBP (6. 6 %), whereas a gradual change was observed in the plume of the river with increasing salinity. In the Marseilles Bay, DiBP was the most abundant PAE at the surface (47. 3 % of total PAEs) followed by DEHP (22. 7 %) and DnBP (19. 1 %), whereas DnBP was predominant (38. 6 %) a few meters above the bottom. By contrast, DEHP was the dominant species in the first 50 m (66. 9 – 76. 7 %) offshore followed by DnBP (10. 9 – 15. 2 %), whereas DnBP was the most abundant (57. 0 – 72. 6 %) followed by DEHP (20. 1 – 33. 1 %) in the deepest waters.

40|$|The {{start of}} the twenty-first century is marked by new levels of globaliza- tion, {{environmental}} degradation, and social conflict that are endangering the cultural landscapes and agrarian heritage of rural areas. In the wake of these threats, heritage profes- sionals are imagining new, holistic models for shared cultural and natural heritage protec- tion that support active community engagement around issues of cultural identity, material and ecological sustainability, and shared ethical values. Agricultural land conservation is fertile terrain in which to theorize how heritage protection can contribute to the mobiliza- tion of social cohesion to restore a balanced human ecology. Agrarian land tenure challenges heritage advocates to bridge the conventional binary of nature/culture that has divided heritage resource protection strategies and to support the protection of working, populated cultural landscapes. Over the past 35 years in the United States, a number of agricultural land protection programs have emerged that depend upon a complex web of cooperation among landowners, governments, and private land trusts to purchase development rights on farmland. I propose that such programs are both symptoms of and coping strategies for broader processes of socio-economic alienation. This paper focuses on a New England case study to explore the potential for agricultural land protection as a framework for shared heritage protection.

The etiology of NSC is still largely unknown, as a genetic basis can be rarely demonstrated especially in single-suture f orms. In these cases, during the prenatal/perinatal dev elopment of af f ected patients, only one suture undergoes a premature direct ossif ication within an otherwise phy siologically grown skull. This could suggest that def inite somatic alterations, possibly due to unclear env ironmental agents, occur locally {{at the site of}} premature suture f usion during skull dev elopment. A promising tool to inv estigate the molecular mechanisms that may orchestrate <b>this</b> ev <b>ent</b> is the comparativ e analy sis of suture- and sy nostosis-deriv ed tissues and cells. Particularly, this rev iew will f ocus on the dif f erent studies that attempted to clarif y this issue using genome-wide microarray -based technologies f or the comparativ e analy sis of gene expression prof iles. All relev ant results will be comprehensiv ely rev iewed, possibly compared and critically discussed...|$|R

T here may be several reasons fo r <b>this.</b> Resid <b>ent</b> training programs are str uc tured to {{last three or four}} years in North America and traditionall y are under th e auspices of specific university departments. This is a rela tively short period of training compared to European co untries, and consequently th ere tends to be less flexibility, and therefore less mobility, in training. Residencies also tend to be a co mbination of education, training and serv ice requirements, and as programs have a specific allocation of positions for each yea r during th e residency, absenteeism ma y well compromise deli very of health ca re. In addition, th ere are impor tant considerations for th e residents th emselves, who tend to be older, perhaps ma rried with a young family.
