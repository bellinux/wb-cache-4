5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was <b>to</b> <b>raid</b> the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, {{so that by the}} time he reached the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, it had already been captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force <b>to</b> <b>raid</b> shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E

In 865, Khafaja led in person an expedition against the environs of Enna—which may signify that the Byzantines had retaken it, or that they still held forts in its vicinity—before moving onto Syracuse, but again his son Muhammad was defeated in an ambush, losing 1,000 men.|$|E

While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them <b>to</b> <b>raid.</b> Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
