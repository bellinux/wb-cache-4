25|$|For {{practical}} applications, gratings {{generally have}} ridges or rulings on their surface rather than dark lines. Such gratings {{can be either}} <b>transmissive</b> or reflective. Gratings which modulate the phase rather than the amplitude of the incident light are also produced, frequently using holography.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflective}} and <b>transmissive</b> {{cases are}} very similar to the emissive case, with a few differences. The spectral radiance Le,Ω,λ is replaced by the spectral reflectance (or transmittance) S(λ) of the object being measured, multiplied by the spectral power distribution of the illuminant I(λ).|$|E
25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{the mirror}} coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more <b>transmissive</b> to infrared light.|$|E
25|$|A low {{aluminium}} {{glass mirror}} is manufactured by coating silver and {{two layers of}} protective paint on the back surface of glass. A low aluminium glass mirror is very clear, light <b>transmissive,</b> smooth, and reflects accurate natural colors. This type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of the frame is predominantly white.|$|E
25|$|Since LCD panels produce {{no light}} of their own, they require {{external}} light to produce a visible image. In a <b>transmissive</b> type of LCD, this light is provided {{at the back of}} the glass stack and is called the backlight. While passive-matrix displays are usually not backlit (e.g. calculators, wristwatches), active-matrix displays almost always are. Over the last years (1990 - 2017), the LCD backlight technologies have strongly been emerged by lighting companies such as Philips, Lumileds (a Philips subsidiary) and more.|$|E
25|$|A lens is a <b>transmissive</b> {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E
25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and <b>transmissive</b> properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E
25|$|Transmissivity is {{determined}} by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For <b>transmissive</b> mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or laser output couplers, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as zinc selenide or synthetic sapphire may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, George H. Heilmeier, {{then working}} at the RCA {{laboratories}} on the effect discovered by Williams achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier {{continue to work on}} scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally the achievement of the first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the dynamic scattering mode (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in <b>transmissive</b> and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone. In the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK's Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England. The team at RRE supported ongoing work by George William Gray and his team at the University of Hull who ultimately discovered the cyanobiphenyl liquid crystals, which had correct stability and temperature properties for application in LCDs.|$|E
25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (<b>transmissive)</b> fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E

2500|$|Diffraction {{can create}} [...] "rainbow" [...] colors when {{illuminated}} {{by a wide}} spectrum (e.g., continuous) light source. The sparkling effects from the closely spaced narrow tracks on optical storage disks such as CDs or DVDs are an example, while the similar rainbow effects caused by thin layers of oil (or gasoline, etc.) on water are not caused by a grating, but rather by interference effects in reflections from the closely spaced <b>transmissive</b> layers (see Examples, below). A grating has parallel lines, while a CD has a spiral of finely-spaced data tracks. Diffraction colors also appear when one looks at a bright point source through a translucent fine-pitch umbrella-fabric covering. Decorative patterned plastic films based on reflective grating patches are very inexpensive, and are commonplace.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a typical}} summer evening in June, the {{atmosphere}} being in such delicate equilibrium and so <b>transmissive</b> that inanimate objects seemed endowed {{with two or three}} senses, if not five. There was no distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the strumming of strings.|$|E
6000|$|I {{go back to}} my point--the way {{in which}} clouds, as a matter of fact, become visible. I have defined the {{floating}} or sky cloud, and defined the falling, or earth cloud. But there's a sort of thing between the two, which needs a third definition: namely, Mist. In the 22d page of his 'Glaciers of the Alps,' Professor Tyndall says that [...] "the marvelous blueness of the sky in the earlier part of the day indicated that the air was charged, almost to saturation, with transparent aqueous vapor." [...] Well, in certain weather that is true. You all know the peculiar clearness which precedes rain,--when the distant hills are looking nigh. I take it on trust from the scientific people that there is then a quantity--almost to saturation--of aqueous vapor in the air, but it is aqueous vapor in a state which makes the air more transparent than it would be without it. What state of aqueous molecule is that, absolutely unreflective[12] of light--perfectly <b>transmissive</b> of light, and showing at once the color of blue water and blue air on the distant hills? ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{transflective}} {{liquid-crystal display}} is a liquid-crystal display (LCD) that reflects and transmits light (transflective is a portmanteau of <b>transmissive</b> and reflective). Under bright illumination (e.g. {{when exposed to}} daylight) the display acts mainly as a reflective display with the contrast being constant with illuminance. Only in dim and dark ambient situations is an auxiliary <b>transmissive</b> backlight needed.|$|E

5000|$|Nose grease {{can be used}} to {{minimize}} scratches in optical surfaces, for example when cleaning photographic negatives. [...] Observatory lore holds that nose grease was used to reduce stray light and reflections in <b>transmissive</b> telescopes before the development of vacuum antireflective coatings. [...] The antireflective properties are {{due in part to the}} fact that the nose oil fills small cracks and scratches and forms a smooth, polished surface, and in part to the low index of refraction of the oil, which can reduce surface reflection from <b>transmissive</b> optics that have a high index of refraction. The same effect is sometimes used by numismatic hobbyists to alter the apparent grade of slightly worn coins.|$|E

50|$|The {{measurement}} and control of both types during manufacture is essential to ensure optimum quality, acceptability and suitability for purpose of the product.For instance, in automotive manufacturing, a high quality reflective appearance is desirable with low reflection haze and high contrast whilst in packaging clear, low haze, highly <b>transmissive</b> films are required so that the contents, foods etc., can be clearly observed.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{difference}} between the <b>transmissive</b> and reflective star coupled fibre networks is that two fibres are needed with the <b>transmissive</b> star coupler to connect a line replaceable item (LRI), but with the reflective star, and a [...] "Y" [...] coupler internal to the LRI, only a single fibre is required: a [...] "Y" [...] coupler, is a three-port optical device that connects the simplex transmitter and simplex receiver to a single fibre that carries the optical signals transmitted and received by the LRI in opposite directions (half duplex). However, while {{the use of the}} reflective star reduces the cabling in the aircraft, and thus weight, the excess losses involved {{in the use of the}} [...] "Y" [...] couplers and reflective star coupler makes meeting the power budget requirements, given a transmitter power and receiver sensitivity, more difficult.Whilst it is explicitly stated that the LS buses may be a fibre optic equivalent to STANAG 3838, e.g. MIL-STD-1773, there are no known implementations of this approach.|$|E

Some 21st century smartwatches such as the Pebble Smartwatch also use transflective LCDs.|$|E
