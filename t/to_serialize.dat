5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E
25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the closing tag is replaced with '/>', the representation is often about the same size as JSON or just a little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression is good at saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2000s, {{publishers}} {{finally found}} it feasible to start commercially supporting manga production: Kaza and Lazhari Labter, both publishers of youth literature, began publishing manga in 2011, and Z-Link, the first publisher dedicated entirely to manga was founded in 2007. Among these, the most notable is Z-Link: with a specific focus on developing new artists and bringing them to the market, it predominantly publishes small-format, softcover, black and white manga books with a small DZ-manga icon in the bottom left corner of their jackets. These run either as independent volumes or, on rare occasions, as installments in a small series (like Victory Road). They are printed on low-quality paper, allowing locally published volumes to remain affordable. This combination of publication strategies has enabled Algerian manga to circumvent the financial barrier to access that young Algerian consumers face with imported manga and even local BD albums. Easy <b>to</b> <b>serialize,</b> Z-Link's low-cost medium has also helped artists to compete – at least on a local level – with foreign manga that admittedly are more intricate and include higher quality graphics.|$|E

500|$|Tremaine's {{policy of}} {{printing}} material {{that he liked}} without staying too strictly {{within the bounds of}} the genre led him <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> H.P. Lovecraft's novel At the Mountains of Madness in early 1936. [...] He followed this with Lovecraft's [...] "The Shadow Out of Time" [...] in June 1936, though protests from science-fiction [...] purists occurred. [...] Generally, however, Tremaine was unable to maintain the high standard he had set in the first few years, perhaps because his workload was high. [...] Tremaine's slow responses to submissions discouraged new authors, although he could rely on regular contributors such as Jack Williamson, Murray Leinster, Raymond Gallun, Nat Schachner, and Frank Belknap Long. [...] New writers who did appear during the latter half of Tremaine's tenure included Ross Rocklynne, Nelson S. Bond, and L. Sprague de Camp, whose first appearance was in September 1937 with [...] "The Isolinguals". [...] Tremaine printed some nonfiction articles during his tenure, with Campbell providing an 18-part series on the solar system between June 1936 and December 1937.|$|E

While the research came easily, he encountered difficulty in writing. To overcome his writer's block, Wolfe wrote to Jann Wenner, editor of Rolling Stone, to propose an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and Thackeray: <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> his novel. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> his work. The frequent deadline pressure gave him the motivation he had hoped for, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of Rolling Stone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collaboration}} {{between the two is}} believed by literary historians to have benefited Lane's career as much as her mother's. [...] Lane's most popular short stories and her two most commercially successful novels were written at this time and were fueled by material which was taken directly from Wilder's recollections of Ingalls-Wilder family folklore. [...] Let the Hurricane Roar (later titled Young Pioneers) and Free Land, both addressed the difficulties of homesteading in the Dakotas in the late 19th century, and how the [...] "free land" [...] in fact cost homesteaders their life savings. The Saturday Evening Post paid Lane top fees <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> both novels, which were later adapted for popular radio performances. Both books represented Lane's creative and literary peak. [...] The Saturday Evening Post paid her $30,000 in 1938 <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> her best-selling novel Free Land, ($ by today's standards). [...] Let the Hurricane Roar saw an increasing and steady sale, augmented by its adaptation into popular radio dramatization that starred Helen Hayes.|$|E

One common technique for amortizing this cost is to batch together multiple independent requests into one compound request.

The standard representation for abstract syntax is to use free monads; we show that free applicative functors are actually a better choice of representation for this scenario...|$|R

There are also location markers, placed after a noun, and hence often called postpositions; these are often used in combination with a coverb.

2500|$|As with Unix {{pipelines}}, PowerShell pipelines can construct complex commands, {{using the}} | operator to connect stages. However, the PowerShell pipeline differs from Unix pipelines in that stages execute within the PowerShell runtime {{rather than as}} a set of processes coordinated by the operating system, and structured [...]NET objects, rather than byte streams, are passed from one stage to the next. Using objects and executing stages within the PowerShell runtime eliminates the need <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> data structures, or to extract them by explicitly parsing text output. An object can also encapsulate certain functions that work on the contained data, which become available to the recipient command for use. For the last cmdlet in a pipeline, PowerShell automatically pipes its output object to the Out-Default cmdlet, which transforms the objects into a stream of format objects and then renders those to the screen.|$|E

The Junimea literati gave Poor Dionis a lukewarm reception. As recorded by the society's official diary, Junimist doyens Titu Maiorescu and Vasile Pogor both noted that [...] "the ending and the resolution do not match into the whole structure". According to literary historian Alexandru Piru, such reactions were merely myopic: [...] "The Junimists [...] did not notice that, at heart, with his use of fairy tale settings, Eminescu depicted {{the fate of the}} genius artist whom a hostile environment has condemned to a chimerical, deplorable, life."

2500|$|Street & Smith, a dime {{novel and}} boys' weekly publisher, was {{next on the}} market. Seeing Argosys success, they {{launched}} The Popular Magazine in 1903, which they billed as the [...] "biggest magazine in the world" [...] {{by virtue of its}} being two pages (the interior sides of the front and back cover) longer than Argosy. Due to differences in page layout however, the magazine had substantially less text than Argosy. The Popular Magazine did introduce color covers to pulp publishing, and the magazine began to take off when in 1905 the publishers acquired the rights <b>to</b> <b>serialize</b> Ayesha, by H. Rider Haggard, a sequel to his popular novel She. Haggard's Lost World genre influenced several key pulp writers, including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy and Abraham Merritt. In 1907, the cover price rose to 15 cents and 30 pages were added to each issue; along with establishing a stable of authors for each magazine, this change proved successful and circulation began to approach that of Argosy. Street and Smith's next innovation was the introduction of specialized genre pulps, with each magazine focusing on a particular genre, such as detective stories, romance, etc.|$|E
