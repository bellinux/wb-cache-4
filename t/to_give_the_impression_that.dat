5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> {{it did not have}} bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members {{would go on to}} direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E

5|$|After {{the attack}} on Yokosuka, the Nagatos crew removed all {{casualties}} from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's ballast tanks were also flooded <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> she had been sunk. During {{the early hours of}} 2August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to be false. On 30August the ship was surrendered to the U.S.Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 29–30July.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. <b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E

5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand {{out in the world}} screens. The cities were designed to not look very fantastical, so as to make the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the people of the city were living both literally and figuratively under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E

25|$|According to Avi Shlaim, in March 1949 as the Iraqi forces withdrew {{and handed}} over their {{positions}} to the Jordanian legion, Israel carried out Operation Shin-Tav-Shin which allowed Israel to renegotiate the cease fire line in the Wadi Ara area of the northern West Bank in a secret agreement that was incorporated into the General Armistice Agreement.

During the day, {{the bulk of the}} Afrika Korps moved <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> this was the main Axis assault.

25|$|There was {{a chapel}} in the {{courthouse}}, 100 {{yards from the}} barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied {{by one of the}} Kellys. At about 10am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms. When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the door was closed and the blinds pulled <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.|$|E
25|$|Later, Khánh phoned Taylor {{from his}} office and {{expressed}} his desire to resign and go abroad along with several other generals, asking for the Americans to fund the costs of travel. He then Taylor the list of generals for whom arrangements needed to be made, and then asked the ambassador to repeat the names for confirmation. Taylor did so, unaware that Khánh was taping the dialogue. Afterwards, Khánh played back the tape out of context to his colleagues, giving them the impression that Taylor was calling {{for them to be}} expelled. Khánh asked his colleagues to participate in a campaign of fomenting anti-American street protests and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the country did not need aid from Washington.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, once Hitler {{had become}} Chancellor, Rosenberg was named {{leader of the}} Nazi Party's foreign political office, but he played little practical part in the role. Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Nazis {{would not be a}} threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the British Empire. It was a notable failure. When Rosenberg laid a wreath bearing a swastika at the Cenotaph, a Labour Party candidate slashed it and later threw it in the Thames and was fined 40 shillings for willful damage at Bow Street magistrate’s court. In January 1934 Hitler granted Rosenberg responsibility for the spiritual and philosophical education of the Party and all related organizations.|$|E

25|$|When the British {{formed a}} line of battle, Landolphe thought from the {{distance}} {{that they were a}} fleet of powerful warships and turned to escape. Belliqueux captured Landolphe’s Concorde. Two East Indiamen set out in pursuit of the other two frigates, with Exeter and Bombay Castle chasing Médée. As darkness fell, Exeter caught up with Médée and Meriton had lights displayed throughout his ship and behind the gun ports <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> she was a ship of the line. Exeter fired a broadside; Bombay Castle possibly did so also. Believing himself outgunned, Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin surrendered Médée, only to discover when he came aboard Exeter that she was a merchant vessel. Horrified, he demanded to be allowed to return to his ship to continue the fight, but Meriton declined the demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{first meeting}} between Zhou and Zhang {{occurred}} inside a church on 7 April 1936. Zhang showed a {{great interest in}} ending the civil war, uniting the country, and fighting the Japanese, but warned that Chiang was firmly in control of the national government, and that these goals would be difficult to pursue without Chiang's cooperation. Both parties ended their meeting with an agreement {{to find a way to}} secretly work together. At the same time that Zhou was establishing secret contacts with Zhang, Chiang was growing suspicious of Zhang, and became increasingly dissatisfied with Zhang's inaction against the Communists. In order to deceive Chiang, Zhou and Zhang deployed mock military units in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Northeast Army and the Red Army were engaged in battle.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{attempts}} to sell the R.90 to the French Navy failed, the aircraft {{attracted the attention of}} the Spanish Republican Air Force, which placed an order for 24 of a landplane derivative, the Romano R.83. This differed in having a conventional fixed tailwheel undercarriage, a non-gulled upper wing and was to be powered by a 450hp (336kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior engine. These aircraft were to be assembled in secret by the Belgium company LACEBA (Les Ateliers de Construction et d'Exploitation de Brevets Aéronautiques). Flight testing in Belgium was carried out with a 280hp (209kW) Salmson 9ABa engine, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft was a trainer rather than a fighter, with the more powerful engine to be fitted when the aircraft was delivered to Spain.|$|E
