5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E

5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible in an all-live production.|$|E

5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief {{that it was the}} only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Davis GAA club instituted {{judicial}} review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that {{the decision of the}} council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium's dimensions. It was only senior GAA games <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> facilitated.|$|E

25|$|February 1, 2008: In Martinez v. County of Monroe, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department {{rules that}} a {{same-sex}} marriage in Canada {{should be recognized}} in New York, because out-of-state opposite-sex marriages <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> legal in New York nonetheless are recognized unless such recognition would violate the public policy of the state. The Appellate Division holds that the same treatment must be applied to out-of-state same-sex marriages, but the ruling could be overturned on a finding that same-sex marriage violates New York's public policy. The decision reverses a trial judge's 2006 ruling that Monroe Community College {{did not have to}} extend health benefits to an employee's same-sex spouse.|$|E

25|$|In February 2008, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department {{ruled that}} a {{same-sex}} marriage consummated in Canada should be recognized in New York. In Martinez v. County of Monroe, the court reasoned that because out-of-state opposite-sex marriages <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> legal in New York nonetheless are recognized unless such recognition would violate the public policy of the state, out-of-state same-sex marriages must be similarly recognized. The Appellate Division reversed a trial judge's ruling in 2006 that Monroe Community College {{did not have to}} extend health benefits to an employee's same-sex spouse. Monroe County subsequently announced its intention to move for leave to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest courts. However, the Court of Appeals refused to hear the case on May 6, 2008, allowing the lower court's ruling to stand. In November 2008, Monroe County announced that it would not pursue any further appeals of the Appellate Division's decision.|$|E
