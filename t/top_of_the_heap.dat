Despite his small level of success, Johnson acknowledged that racism and other prejudices kept a black jazz musician such as himself from securing the amount and quality of work he was qualified to perform. During this period, he played almost no concerts, except in 1977 and 1982 in Japan, and in 1984 in Europe.

40|$|Pressure {{to replace}} fossil fuels {{in order to}} reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} as well as the increased demand for energy have resulted in more intensive harvesting <b>of</b> forests. <b>The</b> current harvesting practice is to <b>heap</b> <b>the</b> logging residues rather than spread them on skid trails. However, little is known about <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> modern harvesting techniques on soil fertility and site productivity. <b>The</b> decomposition <b>of</b> and nutrient release from logging residues after clear-cutting has recently been investigated in Finland, but <b>the</b> nutrient dynamics <b>of</b> logging residues after thinning and especially in <b>the</b> residue <b>heaps</b> is less known. In this study <b>the</b> mass loss <b>of</b> and nutrient release from logging residues were explored for three successive years after first thinning of a Scots pine stand in western Finland. The main objective was to identify <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>heap</b> structure on decomposition and nutrient dynamics. More specifically, the objectives were: 1) To examine how the position within <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> affects <b>the</b> decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics of residue fractions. It was hypothesised that the decomposition and <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> nutrients are greater under <b>the</b> residue <b>heaps</b> than on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> and on <b>the</b> ground. 2) To identify temporal changes in decomposition and nutrient release over a 3 -year period. 3) To determine how much N, P, K, Ca and Mg are released from logging residues during the first three years after first thinning. 4) To assess whether it is more beneficial for nutrient cycling to concentrate the logging residues in heaps or to spread them out from <b>the</b> standpoint <b>of</b> site fertility. 5) To assess <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> harvest of logging residues in terms of their role in nutrient cycling <b>of</b> a stand. <b>The</b> decomposition <b>of</b> Scots pine needles, twigs and branches was determined by measuring the mass loss with the litterbag method. The experimental design was randomized blocks with nine treatments and six replicates. The treatments included three logging residue fractions and three locations <b>of</b> logging residue. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> logging residue type and locations of residue on mass and contents of nutrients remaining in litter bags over the entire 3 -year period were tested by repeated measures ANOVA. In total, 25 % of N, 53 % of P, 87 % of K, 42 % of Ca and 49 % of Mg were released from logging residues in three years. The treatments in this study had no clear effects on <b>the</b> mass loss <b>of</b> logging residues. <b>The</b> hypothesis was confirmed only with needles, for which the mass loss and nutrient release was significantly faster under <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> than on <b>the</b> ground and on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heaps.</b> Treatments did not {{have a significant effect on}} <b>the</b> decomposition <b>of</b> twigs and branches. In the short-term, the logging residues were a minor source of N but a significant source <b>of</b> K. <b>The</b> results indicate that in the short-term logging residues are insignificant for site productivity on sites where <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> N limits productivity. On peatland sites, where <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> K limits productivity, logging residues may be significant on site productivity. However, in the long-term logging residues may be an important source of organic matter and nutrients. Great proportion of nutrients was released from needles within <b>the</b> first year <b>of</b> decomposition. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> nutrient release from needles was slightly faster from <b>the</b> <b>heaps</b> than on <b>the</b> ground over the first year. If residues are collected for energy, heaping and removal after one year would result in more released nutrients than if they were spread on the ground throughout the harvested stand. In order to avoid possible soil nutrient depletion and negative effects on <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> remaining trees, it can be preferable to leave residues in the stand after harvest and remove branches after the needles have been shed...|$|R
