5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain {{the support of the}} masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|Looting {{has been}} linked to <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> {{stability}} of the possessing nation, with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis. It also appears that art collectors have stelae, or portions of them, stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces. Examples of this may be found at Aguateca and El Perú, both in Guatemala's Petén department, where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> {{barriers}} that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{maritime}} trade routes – {{sometimes in the}} form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal – had visible impact on <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> standing of nations. The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically. Other waterways, like the Panama Canal {{played an important role in}} the histories of many nations. Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals. Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains, coal, and ore.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> {{differences}} between western and eastern Virginia began to grow. Following Virginia's secession from the Union in 1861, the Restored Government of Virginia was established at Wheeling during the American Civil War. Despite West Virginia receiving Union statehood on June 20, 1863, sympathies and loyalties within the state's borders remained divided, especially within areas economically {{dependent upon the}} plantation system. However, slaveowners in western Virginia tended to own fewer slaves {{than their counterparts in}} eastern Virginia and many did not support Virginia's secession. In Mason County, where small farms were reliant upon slavery, its residents overwhelmingly supported the Union cause. During the war, many plantations in West Virginia served as preferred venues for military headquarters and meeting places for both Union and Confederate military officers due to their adequate accommodations and resources. Altona near Charles Town was utilized as a military headquarters and meeting place for Union generals Philip Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant, with Sheridan making use of the farm's horses and carriage. Other plantations, like Mill Island and Willow Wall near Moorefield, and Elmwood near Shepherdstown, were utilized as hospitals for wounded soldiers and irregulars.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> {{tensions}} was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent {{was followed by}} an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As {{a result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
