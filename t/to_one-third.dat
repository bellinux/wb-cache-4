5|$|Casualties were {{estimated}} to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971.

5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of normal size.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Nestlé Purina Petcare {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with the Canine Health Foundation to advance veterinary research. The following year the company donated 80 tons of pet food to pets affected by Hurricane Charley in Florida and donated $100,000 to local animal shelters. Nestlé Purina Petcare grew from about 11 percent of Nestlé's revenues in 2001, <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> by 2005.

5000|$|Following {{the trails}} pioneered by fur traders, the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri to the Oregon Territory {{developed}} crossing the central Great Plains, Rocky Mountains and northern Great Basin. Branching off from that route, some settlers traveled southwestward on the California Trail from Fort Hall, Oregon Territory to Sutters Fort, in Mexican Alta California. Also branching {{off to the}} south was the Mormon Trail from Nauvoo, Illinois to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. During the twenty-five years 1841-1866, 250,000 to 650,000 people [...] "pulled up stakes," [...] and headed west along these trails. About <b>one-third</b> immigrated <b>to</b> Oregon, <b>one-third</b> <b>to</b> California and <b>one-third</b> <b>to</b> Utah, Colorado, and Montana.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{commander}} of the Japanese XVIII Army, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, ordered Katagiri to launch another counterattack. The supply situation was acute by this stage, with ammunition running low and troops being limited <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of their daily rations, nevertheless the counterattack was scheduled for 23/24 November. However, the Australian occupation of Pabu and the threat it posed to the Japanese supply route, forced the Japanese commander to bring his schedule forward, and to divert some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen and upon the Australian forces advancing towards Sattelberg in the south.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth <b>to</b> <b>one-third,</b> holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Organic Law No. 99-56 of 30 June 1999, adopted on 3 July by the Chamber of Deputies, formalized the Tunisian flag for {{the first}} time in law, {{clarifying}} Article 4 of the constitution.

5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the United States had {{relied on the}} {{qualitative}} superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup, their large military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, {{which resulted in a}} drop of oil prices in 1985 <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during Gorbachev's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up <b>to</b> <b>one-third</b> of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
