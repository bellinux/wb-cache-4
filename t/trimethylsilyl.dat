25|$|Reaction with <b>trimethylsilyl</b> iodide in {{acetonitrile}} {{followed by}} methanol is a mild and versatile method of deprotecting Boc-protected amines.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{nitriles}} do {{not readily}} release cyanide ions, {{and so have}} low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as <b>trimethylsilyl</b> cyanide (CH3)3SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 when {{he joined}} DuPont, Arduengo {{became a member of}} the {{exploratory}} chemistry group of Howard Simmons in CR. His first research project involved <b>trimethylsilyl</b> esters of inorganic acids as reagents for organic synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Although proportionately a minor outlet, {{organosilicon}} compounds {{are widely used}} in organic synthesis. Notably <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride Me3SiCl is the main silylating agent. One classic method called the Flood reaction for the synthesis of this compound class is by heating hexaalkyldisiloxanes R3SiOSiR3 with concentrated sulfuric acid and a sodium halide.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the Aconitum alkaloids in biological specimens such as blood, serum and urine, several GC-MS methods have been described. These employ a variety of extraction procedures followed by derivatisation to their <b>trimethylsilyl</b> derivatives. New sensitive HPLC-MS methods have been developed as well, usually preceded by SPE purification of the sample.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} method {{published in}} 2007 {{starts with the}} enantioselective desymmetrization of aziridine 1 with <b>trimethylsilyl</b> azide (TMSN3) and a chiral catalyst to the azide 2. The amide group is protected as a BOC group with Boc anhydride and DMAP in 3 and iodolactamization with iodine and potassium carbonate first gives the unstable intermediate 4 and then stable cyclic carbamate 5 after elimination of hydrogen iodide with DBU.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{the upper}} part of the NanoPutian chain begins with 1,3-dibromo-2,4-diiodobenzene as the {{starting}} material. Sonogashira coupling with 4-oxytrimethylsilylbut-1-yne produces 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-1,4-di-bromobenzene. One of the bromine substituents is converted to an aldehyde through an SN2 reaction with the strong base, n-BuLi, and THF in the aprotic polar solvent, DMF to produce 2,5-bis(4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1′-butynyl)-4-bromobenzaldehyde. Another Sonogashira coupling with 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene attaches the lower body of the NanoPutian. The conversion of the aldehyde group to a diether “head” occurs in two steps. The first step involves addition of ethylene glycol and <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride (TMSCl) in CH2Cl2 solvent. Addition of TBAF in THF solvent removes the silyl protecting group.|$|E
25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an alkoxy group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: <b>trimethylsilyl</b> (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable <b>trimethylsilyl</b> (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS). The mass spectrum for 5β-coprostanol - TMS ether {{can be seen in}} the figure.|$|E

2500|$|... 2-(trimethylsiliyl)thiazole [...] (with a <b>trimethylsilyl</b> {{group in}} the 2-position) is a stable {{substitute}} and reacts {{with a range of}} electrophiles such as aldehydes, acyl halides, and ketenes ...|$|E
2500|$|In this conversion, the {{imidazole}} {{serves both}} as the nucleophile and the base. [...] An alternative precursor 1-(trimethylsilyl)imidazole requires more preparative effort with the advantage that the coproduct <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride is volatile.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} other {{products}} are obtained, including <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride and methyltrichlorosilane. [...] About 1 million tons of organosilicon compounds are prepared annually by this route. [...] The method {{can also be used}} for phenyl chlorosilanes.|$|E
2500|$|Organosilyl {{chlorides}} {{are important}} commodity chemicals. [...] They are mainly {{used to produce}} silicone polymers as described above. [...] Especially important silyl chlorides are dimethyldichlorosilane (Me2SiCl2), methyltrichlorosilane (MeSiCl3), and <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride (Me3SiCl). [...] More specialized derivatives that find commercial applications include dichloromethylphenylsilane, trichloro(chloromethyl)silane, [...] trichloro(dichlorophenyl)silane, [...] trichloroethylsilane, and phenyltrichlorosilane.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that A-values do not predict the physical size of a molecule, only the steric effect. [...] For example, the tert-butyl group (A-value=4.9) has a larger A-value than the <b>trimethylsilyl</b> group (A-value=2.5), yet the tert-butyl group actually occupies less space. [...] This difference can be attributed to the longer length of the carbon-silicon bond as compared to the carbon-carbon bond of the tert-butyl group. [...] The longer bond allows for less interactions with neighboring substituents, which effectively makes the <b>trimethylsilyl</b> group less sterically hindering, thus, lowering its A-value. [...] This can also be seen when comparing the halogens. [...] Bromine, iodine, and chlorine all have similar A-values even though their atomic radii differ. A-values then, predict the apparent size of a substituent, and the relative apparent sizes determine the differences in steric effects between compounds. [...] Thus, A-values are useful tools in determining compound reactivity in chemical reactions.|$|E
2500|$|... 3-Butyn-1-ol was {{reacted with}} methanesulfonyl {{chloride}} and triethanolamine to produce its mesylate. The mesylate was displaced to make thiolacetate. The thiol was coupled with 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene {{to create a}} free alkyne. The resulting product, 3,5-(4’-thiolacetyl-1’-butynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl)-benzene, had its <b>trimethylsilyl</b> group removed using tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and AcOH/Ac2O in THF. The free alkyne was then coupled with the upper body product from the earlier synthesis. This resulted in a NanoKid with protected thiol feet.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} useful silicon-containing groups is <b>trimethylsilyl,</b> Me3Si–. The Si–C bond {{connecting}} it {{to the rest of}} the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the fluoride ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic protons; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, selenium, or iodine), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in haloalkanes, but at the oxygen in silyl chlorides; and when <b>trimethylsilyl</b> is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the silyl ether hexamethyldisiloxane, (Me3Si)2O. Conversely, while the SN2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (δ+) at the carbon, the analogous [...] "SN2" [...] reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl triflates are so electrophilic that they react 108 to 109 times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. <b>Trimethylsilyl</b> triflate is in particular a very good Lewis acid and is used to convert carbonyl compounds to acetals and silyl enol ethers, reacting them together analogously to the aldol reaction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, B. M. Trost et al. {{reported}} a formal {{synthesis of the}} antibiotic roseophilin. [...] Trost's route to the macrocyclic core of roseophilin, like others, relied on a Paal–Knorr Pyrrole synthesis to obtain the fused pyrrole. [...] Heating the 1,4-diketone with ammonium acetate in methanol with camphor sulfonic acid and 4 angstrom molecular sieves gave the pyrrole with no N-substitution. [...] This pyrrole {{was found to be}} unstable, and as such was treated with <b>trimethylsilyl</b> ethoxy methoxy chloride (SEM-Cl) to protecte the pyrrole prior to isolation.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclisation {{carried out}} with a diyne and a {{separate}} alkyne affords greater control as well as high atom economy. [...] Using commercially available cyclopentadienylcobalt dicarbonyl, CpCo(CO)2, as catalyst, bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (BTMSA) will react with a diyne-1,2-disubstituted benzene to form an anthroquinone aromatic system as shown below: [...] Benzyne, generated in situ from a bezene ring bearing ortho-distributed triflate and <b>trimethylsilyl</b> substituents, {{can be used to}} generate an aryne in place of an acetylene and combined with a suitable diyne. Such a benzene derivative reacts with 1,7-octadiyne {{in the presence of a}} suitable catalyst to generate a naphthalene system. [...] This is an example of a hexadehydro Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E
2500|$|The hydroboration {{reaction}} {{is a useful}} reaction to functionalize alkenes to alcohols. In the reaction the <b>trimethylsilyl</b> (TMS) group fulfill 2 roles in directing the stereoselectivity of the reaction. First, the bulky size of [...] TMS helped the molecule to preferably adopt a conformation where the TMS is not close to the methyl group on the alkene. Second, the TMS group conferred a stereoelectronic effect on the molecule by adopting an anti conformation to the directing orbitals of the alkene. For the regioselectivity of the reaction, the TMS group can stabilize the developing partial positive charge on the secondary carbon {{a lot better than}} a methyl group.|$|E
2500|$|The {{involvement}} of the otherwise rare Cu(III) oxidation state has been demonstrated in the conjugate addition of the Gilman reagent to an enone: In a so-called rapid-injection NMR experiment at -100°C, the Gilman reagent Me2CuLi (stabilized by lithium iodide) was introduced to cyclohexenone (1) enabling the detection of the copper— alkene pi complex 2. On subsequent addition of <b>trimethylsilyl</b> cyanide the Cu(III) species 3 is formed (indefinitely stable at that temperature) and on increasing the temperature to -80°C the conjugate addition product 4. According to an accompanying in silico experiments [...] the Cu(III) intermediate has a square planar molecular geometry with the cyano group in cis orientation {{with respect to the}} cyclohexenyl methine group and anti-parallel to the methine proton. With other ligands than the cyano group this study predicts room temperature stable Cu(III) compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Alkyl and aryl copper {{complexes}} aggregate both in {{crystalline form}} and in solution. Aggregation is especially evident for charge-neutral organocopper compounds, i.e. species with the empirical formula (RCu), which adopt cyclic structures. [...] Since each copper center requires {{at least two}} ligands, the organic group is a bridging ligand. [...] This effect {{is illustrated by the}} structure of mesitylcopper, which is a pentamer. A cyclic structure is also seen for CuCH2SiMe3, first 1:1 organocopper compound to be analyzed by X-ray [...] crystallography (1972 by Lappert). This compound is relatively stable because the bulky <b>trimethylsilyl</b> groups provide steric protection. It is a tetramer, forming an 8-membered ring with alternating Cu-C bonds. In addition the four copper atoms form a planar Cu4 ring based on three-center two-electron bonds. The copper to copper bond length is 242 pm compared to 256 pm in bulk copper. In pentamesitylpentacopper a 5-membered copper ring is formed, similar to (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)gold, and pentafluorophenylcopper is a tetramer.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the process}} of silylation, polar {{functional}} groups such as alcohols and amines readily undergo reaction with <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride, giving <b>trimethylsilyl</b> ethers and <b>trimethylsilyl</b> amines. These new groups [...] "protect" [...] the original functional group by removing the labile protons and decreasing the basicity of the heteroatom. The lability of the Me3Si-O and Me3Si-N groups can later be removed ("deprotected"). Trimethylsilylation {{can also be used}} to increase the volatility of a compound, enabling gas chromatography of normally nonvolatile substances such as glucose. <b>Trimethylsilyl</b> chloride also reacts with metal acetylides to give <b>trimethylsilyl</b> alkynes such as bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene.

5000|$|Alcohols, {{carboxylic}} acids, amines, thiols, and phosphates can be silylated. The process {{involves the}} replacement of a proton with a trialkylsilyl group, typically <b>trimethylsilyl</b> (-SiMe3). Generally the substrate is deprotonated with a suitable strong base followed by treatment with a silyl chloride (e.g. <b>trimethylsilyl</b> chloride). Often strong bases such butyl lithium or a Grignard reagent are used, {{as illustrated by the}} synthesis of a <b>trimethylsilyl</b> ethers as protecting groups from an alcohol: ...|$|E
50|$|Iodine gives <b>trimethylsilyl</b> iodide.|$|E
50|$|Compounds with <b>trimethylsilyl</b> {{groups are}} not {{normally}} found in nature. Chemists sometimes use a trimethylsilylating reagent to derivatize rather non-volatile compounds such as certain alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids by substituting a <b>trimethylsilyl</b> group for a hydrogen in the hydroxyl {{groups on the}} compounds.
