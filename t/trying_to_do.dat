5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

25|$|Teachers {{and other}} {{educators}} can {{feel as if}} they are pawns in a larger game of chess where school and district leaders are making decisions that cause problems for educators <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their jobs.

25|$|Some of {{the issues}} that {{learning}} organizations were designed to address within institutions is fragmentation, competition and reactiveness. Fragmentation is described as breaking a problem into pieces. For example, each organization has an accounting department, finance, operations, IT and marketing. Competition occurs when employees are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> better or 'beat' others in an assignment instead of collaborating. Reactiveness occurs when an organization changes only in reaction to outside forces, rather than proactively initiating change.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Republican Army {{had just}} 18 tanks of a {{sufficiently}} modern design, and the Nationalists {{took control of}} 10. Naval capacity was uneven, with the Republicans retaining a numerical advantage, but with the Navy's top commanders {{and two of the}} most modern ships, heavy cruisers Canarias —captured at the Ferrol shipyard—and Baleares, in Nationalist hands. The Spanish Republican Navy suffered from the same problems as the army—many officers had defected or had been killed after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Two-thirds of air capability was retained by the government—however, the whole of the Republican Air Force was very outdated.|$|E

25|$|Le Rochelais Le Vacher, {{also known}} as M. Lavacher, Lacase or La Case, was single-handedly {{responsible}} for the conciliation between the Antanosy and the French. La Case, Champmargou's subordinate, having married {{the daughter of a}} roandriana and became a local ruler. After successfully fighting in wars against both the Mahafaly and the Karembola (Antandroy), he organized an army of Antanosy soldiers who saved Campmargou and his troops in a revenge attack they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because of the death of one of the Catholic priests who had insulted Dian Manana, a powerful local roandria. Many of the French died from malaria, including Chamargou.|$|E
25|$|During Kingdom Hearts II, Axel {{is ordered}} by the Organization to capture Roxas or kill him if he refuses to comply.

Axel later finds Sora in a pathway to the World That Never Was and chooses to fight the Nobodies with him.

25|$|Allied forces {{continued}} to kill many Japanese personnel who {{were attempting to}} surrender throughout the war. It is likely that more Japanese soldiers would have surrendered {{if they had not}} believed that they would be killed by the Allies while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Fear of being killed after surrendering {{was one of the main}} factors which influenced Japanese troops to fight to the death, and a wartime US Office of Wartime Information report stated that it may have been more important than fear of disgrace and a desire to die for Japan. Instances of Japanese personnel being killed while attempting to surrender are not well documented, though anecdotal accounts provide evidence that this occurred.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{strategy}} is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork {{will be seen}} {{at the beginning of}} the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and {{strategy is}} seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in various situations during the game.|$|E

I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far more than a mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E
