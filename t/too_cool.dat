5|$|In 1999, Christian and Edge parted {{ways with}} Gangrel, who {{associated}} himself with The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) to form The New Brood; as a result, they began feuding with The Hardy Boyz, {{and went on}} to compete in a ladder match at the No Mercy PPV event on October 17, 1999, for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and $100,000, which The Hardy Boyz won. At Survivor Series, Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz faced <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> and The Hollys in a Four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match where they lost. At Armageddon, Edge and Christian competed in a 8-team battle royal which was won by The Acolytes. At Royal Rumble, Christian competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Rikishi. At No Way Out, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz in a tag team match to determine the number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. On April 2, 2000, at WrestleMania 2000, Christian and Edge defeated The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat Ladder match, which ultimately {{led to the creation of}} the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). At Backlash, Christian and Edge defeated D-Generation X to retain titles. At Judgment Day, Edge and Christian and Kurt Angle lost a Six-man tag team match to Rikishi and <b>Too</b> <b>Cool.</b> They lost the tag titles to <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> soon after, but won them back in a four corners elimination match at King of the Ring. At Fully Loaded they defended the titles against The Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) where they got disqualified but retained the titles.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June23. It reached the eastern Pacific on July3, where associated convection began to increase three days later. Continued slow development occurred thereafter, and following satellite trends, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four-E at 1800UTC on July9. Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> to support a tropical cyclone and into an environment of moderate shear. The low-level circulation became ill-defined and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The low continued northwest until dissipation at 0000UTC the following day.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} that the PCBs be allowed to cool at a reasonable rate. If they are <b>cooled</b> <b>too</b> fast, then the PCB can become warped and the solder can be compromised. On the other hand, if the PCB is allowed to <b>cool</b> <b>too</b> slowly, then the PCB can become brittle and some components may be damaged by heat. The PCB should be cooled by either a fine water spray or air cooled to decrease the amount of damage to the board.|$|R
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E
5|$|They faced Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz at WrestleMania 2000 in {{a triple}} threat tag team ladder match. The Dudley Boyz started the match as the champions, and Edge and Christian won the title. The Hardyz faced Edge and Christian {{for the title}} at Insurrextion and {{defeated}} them by disqualification, which meant that Edge and Christian retained the title. At King of the Ring, the Hardy Boyz squared off in a Four Corners Elimination match for the Tag Team Championship which included the champions <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty), T & A (Test and Albert), and Edge and Christian. The Hardyz were able to eliminate T & A before getting eliminated themselves by Edge and Christian.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are <b>too</b> <b>cool,</b> there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

The match was between <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> and Tommy Dreamer and 2 Tuff Tony. Fatu and Cristopher won after Tony was attempting to hit Fatu with a flaming vodka rag and accidentally hit Dreamer {{in the face with}} it. After this Fatu kicked Tony into a turnbuckle and gave him a stinkface.|$|E

50|$|Its use is {{widespread}} in computers and CPU cooling, where the computer processors produce {{large quantities of}} heat that, if not dissipated, could damage the CPU and other electronic components.

5000|$|A simple {{algorithm}} - {{simulated annealing}} - yields good results with relatively good performance.

The main challenges in developing a simulated annealing solution are choosing a good evaluation function and a good annealing schedule. Generally <b>too</b> fast <b>cooling</b> will degrade the solution, and <b>too</b> slow <b>cooling</b> will degrade the performance, but the schedule is usually quite a complex algorithm, with more than just one parameter.|$|R

25|$|The Eastern {{part of the}} Sierras, {{from the}} Villa General Belgrano area to the Punilla Valley, was {{generally}} considered to be <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> and humid, following the old Argentine stereotype of hot-desert wine-making. Over the last decade, however, boutique wineries have discovered the potential of the exceptional variety of soils and micro-climates in the area, producing wines that have won significant national awards (some near La Cumbrecita, an alpine town that would have been considered <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> for vines recently). The scale of production remains minimal, but large numbers of new producers are experimenting with grape varieties and techniques to make wines that are significantly different from the stereotypical Mendoza Malbecs, often with great success. The large variation in elevation in the Sierras make them suitable for high-altitude wine experimentation, similar to what producers have done in Mendoza.|$|E
50|$|In {{air-cooled}} {{piston engine}} aircraft, spoilers {{may be needed}} to avoid shock cooling the engines. In a descent without spoilers, air speed is increased and the engine will be at low power, producing less heat than normal. The engine may <b>cool</b> <b>too</b> rapidly, resulting in stuck valves, cracked cylinders or other problems. Spoilers alleviate the situation by allowing the aircraft to descend at a desired rate while letting the engine run at a power setting that keeps it from <b>cooling</b> <b>too</b> quickly (especially true for turbocharged piston engines, which generate higher temperatures than normally aspirated engines).|$|R

25|$|Rikishi briefly feuded with Viscera before {{forming a}} wildly popular {{alliance}} with the duo <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty). One night, during Too Cool's traditional post-match dance routine, Rikishi joined them. As the dance routines became more frequent and longer, this popularity translated to a significant push. In the 2000 Royal Rumble match, he eliminated seven opponents, and it took six wrestlers working together to eliminate him.|$|E
25|$|In May 2000, fan {{favorites}} Rikishi and <b>Too</b> <b>Cool</b> feuded with Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle, {{culminating in}} a victory at Judgment Day. After winning the Intercontinental Championship from Chris Benoit on the June 22 episode of SmackDown!, Rikishi qualified for the 2000 King of the Ring tournament. On June 25, at the PPV, he defeated Benoit in the quarterfinals and Val Venis in the semis. Both opponents hit him with a steel chair after losing, weakening his shoulder and helping Kurt Angle defeat him in the final. Stemming from Venis' attack, Rikishi faced him on July 6 and lost the title after Tazz hit him with a television camera. They rematched in a steel cage at Fully Loaded. In this match, Rikishi climbed the cage and, in an allusion to Jimmy Snuka, splashed Venis from the top. Rikishi soon lost the match after Tazz again hit him with a camera.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E

25|$|Through {{much of the}} {{few minutes}} {{after the big bang}} during which {{nucleosynthesis}} could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became <b>too</b> <b>cool</b> for any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|E
25|$|On the November 11, 2013 {{edition of}} Raw, while on {{tour in the}} UK, 3MB changed their name to The Union Jacks, but were {{defeated}} by Santino Marella and Los Matadores. On the November 13, 2013 episode of Main Event, Slater and McIntyre would defeat The Prime Time Players. On the November 15, 2013 episode of SmackDown, The Union Jacks were defeated by R-Truth and The Prime Time Players. On the November 18, 2013 country music episode of Raw, 3MB competed as The Rhinestone Cowboys. McIntyre and Mahal lost to R-Truth and the debuting Xavier Woods in Nashville, Tennessee. Similarly, this trend of name changes continued to amount the group losses as they also lost to The Prime Time Players on SmackDown, as The Fabulous 3Birds, which was a play on legendary tag team, The Fabulous Freebirds. On the November 29, 2013 episode of SmackDown, they were billed as The Plymouth Rockers, a play on The Rockers tag team, even coming out to the Rockers' theme music and faced Los Matadores, along with their mascot, El Torito in a losing effort. Shortly after that match, Slater took time off from WWE to deal with personal issues. He returned on the January 6, 2014 edition of Raw, which saw 3MB defeated by Rikishi and <b>Too</b> <b>Cool.</b> On April 4, 2014, Slater broke his losing streak, picking up the win against Kofi Kingston on Superstars. At WrestleMania XXX, all three members entered the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal and eliminated both The Great Khali and Xavier Woods as a unit, before all three were eliminated by Mark Henry. After WrestleMania, 3MB entered a feud with Los Matadores, which saw Hornswoggle ally himself with the trio so as to feud with El Torito. 3MB won their first match since December 2012 after Slater and McIntyre beat Los Matadores on the April 28, 2014 edition of Raw. On June 12, 2014, both Mahal and McIntyre were released from their WWE contracts, thus disbanding 3MB.|$|E
