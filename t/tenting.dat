50|$|The camp {{consisted}} of two hospital <b>tents</b> (used as dining <b>tent),</b> ten wall <b>tents</b> and <b>tents</b> for servants and soldiers. Three wall <b>tents</b> were floored and the Alexei's was carpeted with oriental rugs. Box stoves and Sibley stoves were provided for the <b>tents.</b>|$|R
50|$|A wall <b>tent,</b> {{also known}} as an {{outfitter}} <b>tent,</b> safari <b>tent,</b> or sheep herder <b>tent</b> {{is a type of}} <b>tent</b> that has four straight vertical walls that provide more headroom than traditional pyramid-shaped <b>tents.</b> Wall <b>tents</b> are typically made of a heavy canvas and are used by hunters because they can accommodate several people and their supplies. Wall <b>tents</b> are suitable as a four-season <b>tent,</b> as they are able to accommodate a wood stove. Wall <b>tents</b> are commonly used in Civil War reenactments, and, in recent years, have also become used for glamping. Frames may be either internal or external.|$|R
5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the <b>tenting</b> method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has 10modern cabins {{that are}} {{available}} to rent on a year-round basis. All cabins are furnished with electric heat, two or three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bath. Cabin renters must bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. One cabin is ADA accessible. There are 120campsites at Ricketts Glen State Park. Each campsite has access to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There are two camping areas on the shores of Lake Jean, with one of the campgrounds on a peninsula. There is also an organized group <b>tenting</b> area, which can accommodate six groups of up to 40persons.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly <b>tenting</b> operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
5000|$|The inner <b>tent</b> {{comprises}} the main living and sleeping {{area of the}} <b>tent.</b> For double skin <b>tents,</b> the inner <b>tent</b> (often mesh) is not waterproof since it is protected by the rain fly. For single skin <b>tents,</b> the inner <b>tent</b> is often made of waterproof-breathable material that prevents liquid water from penetrating {{the inside of the}} <b>tent,</b> but still allows water vapour to be transported out.|$|R
5000|$|Range <b>tents</b> {{are similar}} to spike <b>tents</b> in their shape and size, except range <b>tents</b> usually do not have side walls at all. They {{resemble}} a pyramid type shape and are {{often referred to as}} pyramid <b>tents.</b> Range <b>tents</b> can either be set up with a bi-pole system that goes {{on the outside of the}} <b>tent,</b> or they can be set up using a single frame pole which goes in the middle of the <b>tent</b> on the inside, and they can also be set up by tying the top of the <b>tent</b> to a hanging tree branch. Also known as teepee <b>tents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because truck <b>tent</b> camping is a {{somewhat}} novel idea, few companies produce them. Napier and The Adventure Truck <b>Tent</b> {{are the most}} notable names in truck <b>tent</b> camping, followed closely by Rightline Gear, which brands their truck <b>tents</b> under the name CampRight. Although most truck <b>tents</b> are fundamentally the same, they do contain some variation. Napierâ€™s truck <b>tents</b> are completely enclosed, which means there is a layer of <b>tent</b> that covers {{the bottom of the}} truck bed. In contrast, the Adventure Truck <b>Tent</b> and CampRight truck <b>tents</b> leave the bottom open and bare. Napier <b>tents</b> also include a small awning for added rain protection. Kodiak is known for its tunnel shape design which promotes a roomier camping.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tents</b> {{are often}} used in {{humanitarian}} emergencies, such as war, earthquakes and fire. The primary choice of <b>tents</b> in humanitarian emergencies are canvas <b>tents,</b> because a cotton canvas <b>tent</b> allows functional breathability while serving the purpose of temporary shelter. <b>Tents</b> distributed by organisations such as UNHCR are made by various manufacturers, depending on the region where the <b>tents</b> are deployed, as well as depending on the purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The festival had {{formerly}} featured nine main dance <b>tents</b> and stages: Main [...] "Glade" [...] Dance <b>Tent</b> (major artists), Breaksday (UK breakbeat), idSpiral (chillout and non-musical acts), Liquid Connective (psy-trance), Origin (psy-trance), Sancho Panza (house), Pussy Parlure (soul, salsa, R&B, reggae and world), Overkill (formerly the LittleBig <b>tent,</b> featuring breakcore, gabber techno and mash-up) and the Rabbit Hole (secret club, party <b>tent,</b> jam <b>tent</b> by Arabian <b>Tent</b> Company). However, {{the main}} dance <b>tent</b> was scrapped for the 2007 event {{and replaced by}} a new open air stage for predominantly live acts and two smaller <b>tents</b> comprising a techno <b>tent</b> (Vapor) and the Roots <b>Tent,</b> which is themed {{on the origins of}} dance music. There was also a new space called the Nectar Temple, comprising visionary and performance arts from a Californian arts collective.|$|R
25|$|Backpacking is {{the outdoor}} {{recreation}} of carrying gear on one's back, while hiking {{for more than}} a day. It is often but not always an extended journey, and may or may not involve camping outdoors. In North America <b>tenting</b> is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts found widely in Europe are rare. In New Zealand, tramping is an equivalent term though overnight huts are frequently used. Hill walking is the equivalent in Britain, though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Similar terms used in other countries are trekking and bushwalking.|$|E
25|$|Guests {{interested}} in staying overnight at Moraine State Park have three options. A {{limited number of}} guests may use a shelter on the North Country Trail that is available on a reservation basis. Organized large groups, such as Boy Scouts can use one of two large group <b>tenting</b> area. Both areas lack showers, {{but they do have}} picnic tables, cooking grills and fresh water.

These sites are equipped with firewood, pit privies, picnic tables and food storage containers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tent</b> {{caterpillars}} {{are readily}} recognized {{because they are}} social, colorful, diurnal and build conspicuous silk <b>tents</b> in the branches of host trees. Some species, such as the eastern <b>tent</b> caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, build a single large <b>tent</b> which is typically occupied through {{the whole of the}} larval stage, while others build a series of small <b>tents</b> that are sequentially abandoned. Whereas <b>tent</b> caterpillars make their <b>tents</b> in the nodes and branches of a tree's limbs, webworms enclose leaves and small branches at the ends of the limbs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tent</b> cities: Ad hoc campsites of <b>tents</b> and improvised shelters {{consisting}} of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as rail yards, highways and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate <b>tent</b> cities, such as Dignity Village, are actually hybrids of <b>tent</b> cities and shantytowns. <b>Tent</b> cities frequently consist only of <b>tents</b> and fabric improvised structures, with no semi-permanent wood structures at all.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tent</b> is a {{protocol}} for open, decentralized social networking. <b>Tent</b> users share content with apps and each other. Anyone {{can run a}} <b>Tent</b> server, or write an app or alternative server implementation that uses the <b>Tent</b> protocol. Users can take their content and relationships {{with them when they}} change or move servers. <b>Tent</b> supports extensible data types so developers can create new kinds of interaction. <b>Tent</b> is inspired by Project Xanadu.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes {{called the}} 'patrol method.' Scouts are {{organised}} {{in small groups}} (about five to seven Scouts) {{because this is the}} natural way boys work together. These patrols are therefore more important than the Scout troop. Patrols must be kept intact under all circumstances, including working, <b>tenting,</b> learning, cooking, and surviving together. In a Patrol the Scouts learn to work with others, while the Patrol leader learns responsibility for others. Both have to give up part of their personal interest for this. However, Scouting deals with the individual, not with the Company. A Scout has his own identity within the group and learns as an individual. The Patrol serves as the character school for the individual. Younger sections, such as Cub Scouts and Beaver Scouts, are divided into sixes (Cubs) or lodges (Beavers). While Beaver lodges have no leader structure, Cub sixes have a sixer and seconder.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{tests can}} be {{performed}} to assess the cardiovascular status of the patient. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) {{is a measure of}} hydration status, with a value 45% being considered significant. Increasing values over repeated examination are also considered significant. The total protein (TP) of blood may also be measured, as an aid in estimating the amount of protein loss into the intestine. Its value must be interpreted along with the PCV, {{to take into account the}} hydration status. When laboratory tests are not available, hydration can be crudely assessed by <b>tenting</b> the skin of the neck or eyelid, looking for sunken eyes, depression, high heart rate, and feeling for tackiness of the gums. Jugular filling and quality of the peripheral pulses can be used to approximate blood pressure. Capillary refill time (CRT) may be decreased early in the colic, but generally prolongs as the disease progresses and cardiovascular status worsens.|$|E
25|$|With mild to {{moderate}} hyperkalemia, there is prolongation of the PR interval and development of peaked T waves. Severe hyperkalemia results in a widening of the QRS complex, and the ECG complex can evolve to a sinusoidal shape. There {{appears to be a}} direct effect of elevated potassium on some of the potassium channels that increases their activity and speeds membrane repolarization. Also, (as noted above), hyperkalemia causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels. The faster repolarization of the cardiac action potential causes the <b>tenting</b> of the T waves, and the inactivation of sodium channels causes a sluggish conduction of the electrical wave around the heart, which leads to smaller P waves and widening of the QRS complex. Some of potassium currents are sensitive to extracellular potassium levels, for reasons that are not well understood. As the extracellular potassium levels increase, potassium conductance is increased so that more potassium leaves the myocyte in any given time period.|$|E
