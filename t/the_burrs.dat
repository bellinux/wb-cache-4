40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the finite element {{modeling}} of burr formation in high speed micromilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V. Studies show that <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> produced at <b>the</b> up milling side at the exit of the micromilling tool is <b>the</b> biggest among <b>burrs</b> at other locations. Therefore, side exit <b>burr</b> at <b>the</b> up milling side has been modeled through finite element modeling. Johnson cook material constitutive model has been implemented in <b>the</b> formulation of <b>burr</b> formation. Experimental work has been performed to validate the developed model. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> height and width obtained from the simulation has been validated experimentally with a maximum error of 15 %. It was found from the literature review that the cutting speed is the factor, which influences <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> formation. Therefore, <b>the</b> model has been further extended to study the effect of cutting speed on <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> size. A maximum tool rotation of 200, 000 rpm was considered with a tool diameter of 500 mu m. It is predicted from the simulation that, <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> size was reduced by 96 % (both height and width) if cutting tool speed was increased from 10, 000 to 200, 000 rpm. Therefore, it is concluded that the cutting speed is the major factor to reduce <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> size in micromilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V. This study shows that the high speed micromachining center can be helpful in producing the micro parts with less or no burrs. It is expected that further extension of <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> formation model can minimize <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> size to zero/near zero size. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{illustrate}} {{one of the}} mechanisms of rotational atherectomy burr entrapment in a coronary stent where <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> was rolled up in the stent's struts. We report {{a case where the}} treatment of a mid right coronary artery (RCA) lesion using a rotational atherectomy device was attempted. During <b>the</b> procedure, <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> suddenly got stuck in a freshly implanted stent in the distal RCA. Despite several attempts and maneuvers, we were unable to pull back <b>the</b> <b>burr.</b> <b>The</b> patient was transferred for emergency surgery. The length of the RCA from its proximal third to the crux, including <b>the</b> stuck <b>burr</b> and <b>the</b> freshly implanted stent, had to be extracted. Physicians performing rotational atherectomy should be aware of this complication and know the principal endovascular maneuvers to extract <b>the</b> stuck <b>burr.</b> Operators should also be aware of roll-up burr entrapment, like this case, where most maneuvers to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> will fail and should be managed, to our point of view, with surgery...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Burr</b> Arch Truss, <b>Burr</b> Truss, or <b>the</b> <b>Burr</b> Arch, is a {{combination}} of an arch and a multiple kingpost truss design typically implemented in the construction of covered bridges. The design principle behind <b>the</b> <b>Burr</b> arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge rigid.

40|$|Size effects play {{a decisive}} role in burr formation. To {{characterize}} them, different burr parameters, {{such as the}} hydrostatic bowl or <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> shear zone, have been conducted. Both thermo-mechanical quantities in <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> shear zone and the hydrostatic bowls do significantly depend on scaling effects. This result bases {{on the development of}} software for a better analysis and unterstanding of <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> formation process. Significant size effects due to the variation of tool chamfer and feed rate on cutting and thrust forces have been determined...|$|R

40|$|Entrapment of <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> within calcified lesion is an uncommon, but serious {{complication}} during rotational atherectomy {{and usually}} needs surgical retrieval. We report a case series of this complication and also review the possible mechanisms, such as kokesi phenomenon or insufficient pecking motion with decreased rotational speed. We also review the potential techniques ever proposed to rescue this complication percutaneously, including simple manual traction, balloon dilation {{to release the}} trap, snaring <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> as distal as possible for forceful local traction and wedging <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> with a child catheter to facilitate retrieval. Gentle pecking motion of <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> for sufficient ablation and shortening the run less than 15 s may avoid such complications.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{clearance}} and sheet thickness in the AA 5754 sheet material blanking process on <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> formation and blanking force was examined experimentally. Measurements of <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> height and blanking force were {{performed in a}} modular die with six different clearance values (8 %, 10 %, 12 %, 14 %, 16 % and 18 %) by applying the blanking process to the AA 5754 sheet metal of 1 mm and 2 mm in thickness. The influence rate of parameters affecting <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> height, <b>the</b> blanking force, and the mathematical relationship between them were identified by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the regression analysis.

In addition, {{it was found that the}} sheet thickness and clearance affected <b>the</b> <b>burr</b> formation at rates of 23. 24 % and 76. 15 %, respectively; on the other hand, the sheet thickness and clearance affected the blanking force at rates of 99. 72 % and 0. 24 %, respectively...|$|R

As soon as he turned round he saw the master standing very near him. He felt very much ashamed and afraid, and hung down his head.|$|E
