Their nutritive properties have not, however, been thoroughly investigated yet, and their nutritive values have been {{generally considered to}} be inferior to those of starches and sugars for every species of animal. Recently Furth and Engel have reported that rats could store only negligible quantity of glycogen in their livers when fed on the cherry gum or <b>tragant</b> gum. The present work has been undertaken to see if any fat and glycogen can be accumulated in the bodies of rabbits when gum arabic was given to them {{as an example of the}} plant gums, and to determine the amount of each, if any. 人畜の食餌中にゴム質物の分布の極めで廣汎なるに鑑み其の代表としてアラビヤゴムを探り, 其の體脂肪竝びにグリコーゲン生成能を草食動物なる家兎につきて測定せり...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws from}} a larger study that {{examined}} the structuring of language lessons (<b>Tragant</b> 1994), that is, how teachers {{set the stage for}} activity and how they bring activity to a close. One major observation in that study was that there were times where what the teacher told students to do differed from what some students ended up doing in their groups or individually. The present article intends to present, classify and interpret the instances where that mismatch occurred. The data consists of eighteen transcripts from three undergraduate EFL classrooms at a major university in Spain. The analysis of the data points to three types of mismatches (simplified performances, adapted performances and overworking behaviours) and relates them with a number of aspects of the activity (i. e., the linguistic requirement and the activity-type) and with the instructor's teaching style...|$|E

This classroom-based research paper studies the impact of the teaching of listening strategies with authentic videos on students’ listening comprehension skills and their perceptions of the intervention. The training sessions were carried out in eight weeks with a group of secondary school students. The strategies group received training on the development of listening strategies using authentic videos whereas the role-play group was asked comprehension questions after the viewing of the video followed by oral activities. The study shows that systematic instruction in the use of strategies did not result in the improvement of listening comprehension. However, students who had been trained in listening strategies demonstrated a statistically significant increase over their counterparts in a role-play group, -not only in most of the concepts referring to their perceptions of the listening activities but also in their level of metacognition awareness related to the listening skill learning...|$|E
