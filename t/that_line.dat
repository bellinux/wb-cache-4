5|$|Due to the MTA {{financial}} {{crisis in the}} late 2000s, the G was to be cut back from Forest Hills–71st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally ran on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on <b>that</b> <b>line</b> on April 19. In addition, train headways were reduced, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains.|$|E
5|$|From May to October, the Haymaker Farmers' Market {{operates}} every Saturday {{morning in}} the downtown area adjacent to and under the Greer Bridge of Haymaker Parkway. The location is marked by a commissioned mural completed in October 2012 on the two bridge supports <b>that</b> <b>line</b> each side of the market's area. The market was established in 1992 and includes over 40 vendors, {{making it one of the}} oldest and largest farmers' markets in Northeast Ohio.

5|$|In 1865, {{powers were}} granted {{to extend the}} line from Newport Pagnell to Olney {{and then on to}} meet the Northampton and Peterborough Railway at Wellingborough. Construction was underway, and a bridge had been {{completed}} when the extension was abandoned in 1871. Olney was later served by a station on the Midland Railway's Bedford–Northampton line from 1872, <b>that</b> <b>line</b> closing in 1962.|$|E

To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil.

5|$|Such {{plans are}} subject to {{approval}} by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment {{of many of the}} current expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the Peters plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning <b>that</b> <b>Line</b> C's extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.|$|E

5|$|The GWR built a 6 MW {{power station}} at Park Royal and {{electrified}} {{the line between}} Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the H on 5 November 1906. In the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District station at Whitechapel until <b>that</b> <b>line</b> was electrified in 1913. The H service stopped running to Richmond over the L on 31 December 1906, although GWR steam rail motors ran from Ladbroke Grove to Richmond until 31 December 1910.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{appearance}} {{today is}} shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period.

5|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{found in}} the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also {{have a positive effect}} on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells <b>that</b> <b>line</b> blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures <b>that</b> <b>line</b> {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E

5|$|Upminster Bridge is a London Underground {{station on}} Upminster Road in the Upminster Bridge {{neighbourhood}} of the London Borough of Havering in northeast London, England. The station {{is on the}} District line and is the penultimate station on the eastern extremity of <b>that</b> <b>line.</b> The station was opened on 17 December 1934 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on the local electrified tracks between Upminster and Barking that were constructed in 1932. The main station building is of a distinctive polygonal design. It has relatively low usage for a suburban station with approximately 1 million entries and exits during 2011.|$|E

50|$|The serous {{membrane}} {{is a particular}} type of secretory epithelium which covers organs in body cavities and secretes serous fluid to reduce friction from muscle movement. Serous membrane lining the abdominopelvic cavity is called the peritoneum; <b>that</b> <b>lining</b> heart and mediastinum is the pericardium, and <b>that</b> <b>lining</b> the thoracic cavity and lungs is the pleura. Technically a ‘serous carcinoma’ can occur anywhere on these membranes, but high-grade serous carcinoma is generally limited to the peritoneal area.|$|R

5|$|Within the {{memorial}} the architects added an inner shrine, or Record Room, in {{which could be}} recorded {{the names of the}} South Australians who fell during the war. While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes <b>that</b> <b>line</b> the walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees <b>that</b> <b>line</b> the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
