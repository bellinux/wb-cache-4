40|$|Recent {{community}} level Census {{data show}} that most small communities in Nebraska experienced population decline since 2000. However, most of the larger communities experienced population growth during this same time period. Various economic development strategies could be employed by <b>communities</b> to grow <b>their</b> population and economies. Given these conditions, how do rural Nebraskans feel about <b>their</b> <b>community?</b> Are they satisfied with the services provided by <b>their</b> <b>community?</b> Are they planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year? Have these views changed over the past sixteen years? How do rural Nebraskans believe various economic development strategies would impact <b>their</b> <b>community?</b> This paper provides {{a detailed analysis of}} these questions. This report details 2, 490 responses to the 2011 Nebraska Rural Poll, the sixteenth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions about <b>their</b> <b>community</b> and economic development strategies. Trends for some of these questions are examined by comparing data from the fifteen previous polls to this year’s results. In addition, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, that is, comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: -By many different measures, rural Nebraskans are positive about <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> Many rural Nebraskans rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> favorably on its social dimensions. Over one-half of rural Nebraskans say {{it would be difficult to}} leave <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> Most rural Nebraskans disagree that <b>their</b> <b>community</b> is powerless to control its future. -Residents of smaller communities are more likely than residents of larger <b>communities</b> to rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> favorably on its social dimensions and to have positive sentiments about <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> Persons living in or near smaller communities are more likely than persons living in or near larger <b>communities</b> to rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> as friendly, trusting and supportive. Persons living in or near smaller communities are more likely than persons living in or near larger communities to say it would be difficult to leave <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> -Residents of larger communities are more likely than residents of smaller <b>communities</b> to say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better during the past year and will be a better place to live ten years from now. Persons living in or near larger communities are more likely than persons living in or near smaller <b>communities</b> to say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better during the past year. Persons living in or near larger communities are more likely than persons living in or near smaller <b>communities</b> to say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> will be a better place to live ten years from now. -Except for a few services that are largely unavailable in rural communities, rural Nebraskans are generally satisfied with basic community services and amenities. -Few rural Nebraskans are planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year, but most of those who do plan to move expect to leave the state. -Most rural Nebraskans believe strategies that assist small businesses and entrepreneurs would have a positive impact on <b>their</b> <b>community...</b>|$|R

Almost one-half (47 %) agree that new residents attend community events. -Residents of the Panhandle are more likely than persons living in other regions of the state to agree that new residents improve the quality of life in <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> Thirty-nine percent of Panhandle residents agree with this statement, compared to 26 percent of residents in the Northeast region. - Newcomers to the community are less likely than longer term residents to agree that new residents to <b>their</b> <b>community</b> are made to feel welcome and that the community does a lot to include new residents. Forty-seven percent of persons living in <b>their</b> <b>community</b> for five years or less agree with the statement that new residents to <b>their</b> <b>community</b> are made to feel welcome, compared to 57 percent of persons living in the community for more than five years.

40|$|Many rural {{communities}} have experienced population losses {{during the past}} decade. Coupled with the aging population, this has resulted in many communities struggling to remain viable. However, improvements in technology have presented many opportunities for the rural areas to grow and prosper. Given these changes, how do rural Nebraskans feel about <b>their</b> <b>community?</b> Are they planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year? This report details 3, 199 responses to the 2001 Nebraska Rural Poll, the sixth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked {{a series of questions}} regarding <b>their</b> <b>community</b> and <b>their</b> plans to move or stay in <b>their</b> <b>community.</b> Trends for the community questions are examined by comparing data from the five previous polls to this year’s results. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, i. e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	Rural Nebraskans have increasingly stated that <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has remained the same. This year, 53 percent state <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has remained the same during the past year, compared to 38 percent in 1996. Conversely, the proportion saying <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better has declined from 38 percent in 1996 to 28 percent this year. The proportion saying <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the worse has remained fairly steady across all six years. •	Farmers and ranchers are less likely than persons with different occupations to believe <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better during the past year. Only 18 percent of the farmers and ranchers say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better, compared to 39 percent of the persons with administrative support positions. •	Respondents living in larger communities are more likely than the persons living in smaller <b>communities</b> to state <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better. Thirty-four percent of the persons living in communities with populations of 5, 000 or more say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has changed for the better, compared to only 16 percent of the persons living in communities with less than 500 people. •	The majority of rural Nebraskans rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> as friendly, trusting, and supportive. Seventy-two percent rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> as friendly, 62 percent say <b>their</b> <b>community</b> is trusting, and 62 percent rate <b>their</b> <b>community</b> as supportive. •	Over one-third of rural Nebraskans are dissatisfied with the following services and amenities in their community: entertainment, retail shopping, streets, and restaurants. Service and amenities residents are most satisfied with include parks and recreation, basic medical care services, library services, and education (K - 12). •	Younger respondents report being more dissatisfied with their city/village government as compared with older respondents. Thirty-eight percent of the persons between the ages of 19 and 39 are dissatisfied with their city/village government, compared to 24 percent of the persons age 65 and older. •	Persons living in the Panhandle are more likely than those living elsewhere to be dissatisfied with their airline service. Thirty-one percent of the Panhandle residents are dissatisfied with their airline service, as compared to only 11 percent of the residents in the Southeast region of the state. •	Only four percent of the respondents are planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year. This proportion has remained fairly steady during the past four years. •	The proportion of younger rural Nebraskans planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> has increased from last year. In 2000, 10 percent of the persons age 19 to 29 were planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> and 10 percent were uncertain. This year, 18 percent are planning to move and 13 percent are uncertain. •	The rural Nebraskans who are planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> are increasingly planning to move to the metropolitan areas of the state. The proportion of persons planning to move to either the Lincoln or Omaha metropolitan areas has steadily increased during the past three years. In 1999, 10 percent of the expected movers planned to move to the metropolitan areas, compared to 18 percent this year. The proportion of expected movers planning to leave the state has decreased since 1999 (from 52 percent to 44 percent). •	The younger respondents are more likely than the older respondents to be planning to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year. Eighteen percent of the persons age 19 to 29 are planning to leave <b>their</b> <b>community,</b> compared to only three percent of the persons age 65 and older. Thirteen percent of the younger respondents are undecided about their plans to move. •	The top three ranked factors influencing rural Nebraskans’ decisions to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> are: lack of economic opportunities in <b>their</b> current <b>community,</b> for lower taxes, and to find a better job. Seventy-two percent of those either planning to move or considering a move cite a lack of economic opportunities in <b>their</b> <b>community</b> as being “very important” or “somewhat important” in influencing their decision to move, 67 percent want to move to lower their taxes, and 66 percent are looking to find a better job. •	Approximately one-third of rural Nebraskans say “to find a better job” is the most important factor influencing their decision to move from <b>their</b> <b>community</b> in the next year. Thirty-two percent identify this item as the most important factor influencing their decision to move. Eleven percent cite the following factors as being the most important factors influencing their move: being closer to relatives, for lower taxes and a reason other than those listed. •	Economic opportunities are more important considerations for the younger persons as compared to the considerations influencing older respondents’ migration decisions. The top reasons influencing the decision to move for the persons under the age of 50 are: lack of economic opportunities, for lower taxes, and to find a better job. The persons age 65 and older who are considering a move cite the following reasons: for lower taxes, to lower cost of living, better access to health care, and for a more desirable climate...|$|R
