5000|$|These in turn were {{replaced}} by ammunition boots, which were used {{in a variety of}} similar design patterns from the late 1880s until the late 1960s. The [...] "George Boots" [...] worn with the Officers' dress uniform and mess dress are similar, but they lack the leather counter (heel cap), the toe case (toe-cap) and omit the hobnails, and the steel heel and <b>toe</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
50|$|Soldiers {{were issued}} {{two pairs of}} boots, both made with a brown finish {{that had to be}} {{polished}} black. There was a brief period (1908 to 1914) where they were issued one pair that was hand-polished in black for parade and drill and one pair finished in raw brown hide for fatigue duty and field service. World War I forced the reversion to brown leather boots for Other Ranks but polished black boots were still worn by some individuals or units out of habit. Officers, who purchased their own uniforms, were still required to wear polished brown boots and matching leather Sam Browne belt with their field service uniform, marking them apart from their men. Officers' boots had heel plates, but lacked the sole studs and <b>toe</b> <b>plates</b> because they could afford to have the soles replaced. The later Boots, General Service adopted in 1927 were issued from the factory in black leather.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the {{introduction}} of [...] "safety bindings" [...] replaced the <b>toe</b> <b>plate</b> with more complex auto-release systems, while retaining the heel cable to keep the boot against the toe binding. Over time, the heel cable was replaced with new clip-on binding designs, starting in the late 1950s. By the late 1960s, bear-trap bindings had largely disappeared from the alpine skiing world.|$|R
30|$|In the {{manufacturing}} and assembling process of steel bridges, {{there may be}} abrupt change in the cross-sectional geometry near the weld <b>toe,</b> <b>plate</b> misalignment, initial geometric imperfections, the plate gap and weld penetration. Therefore, because of the local stress concentration phenomenon, the fatigue crack is easy to occur and expand at the weld toe or root. Based {{on the results of}} stress analysis, an attempt was made to construct simple relationships among the stress concentration and above parameters.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} box of Aurea are virtually {{identical to the}} FIAT 501 model but do not contain the characteristic FIAT throttle arrangement. Aurea vehicles have a throttle knob located longitudinally parallel to the steering column rod and protrude through <b>toe</b> board <b>plate.</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditional beam {{connections}} to the minor axis of a column have relatively low strength and stiffness. A modified detail, using a plate welded between the toes of the column flange - {{referred to as a}} <b>toe</b> <b>plate</b> connection - is examined in this paper. The results of an experimental investigation for both flush and extended end-plate connections connected to a 25 mm thick end-plate are presented. The tests are complemented by finite element modelling which compares very well with the test observations. The results show a significant increase in both moment resistance and initial stiffness for this connection detail compared with connections made directly to the column web. This offers the prospect of more optimal solutions taking advantage of partial strength frame design for the minor axis as well as major axis...|$|R
5|$|Kurt Busch {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by outside polesitter Jeff Gordon. On the following lap, Smith began to assist Busch by drafting. On lap 3, NASCAR held {{a moment of silence}} to honor Dale Earnhardt, who was killed ten years earlier in the 2001 race. On lap4, A. J. Allmendinger and Mark Martin moved to the first and second positions. A lap later, the first caution was flown when Kyle Busch got turned sideways. Under caution, he made a pit stop to have his car's <b>toe</b> <b>plate</b> checked and to have the front end aligned. When the race restarted on lap8, Kevin Harvick led but after one lap, Martin and Allmendinger passed him. Three laps later, the second caution came out when J. J. Yeley had an engine failure. Most of the drivers made pit stops under the caution, except for Brad Keselowski. At the restart, he would lead and Bobby Labonte passed him for the lead on the next lap.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} finite element analysis, elastic modulus and Poisson’s {{ratio of the}} weld were assumed {{to be the same}} as those of the flange and the web, and a linear elastic model is used. Modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio and weld toe angle are taken to be 207  GPa, 0.3 and 45 °, respectively. Yield strength of steel is 345  MPa. In addition, the transition arc between weld <b>toe</b> and <b>plate</b> was ignored in the modeling.|$|R
30|$|Initial {{results have}} been {{analyzed}} and publications are in preparation by the science team; we comment {{on the fact that}} science outcomes were new and ground-breaking, revealing frictional heating took place at the <b>toe</b> of the <b>plate</b> boundary zone, matching the location detected by LWD and geological samples [14]. Both temperature anomaly analysis and laboratory experiments [15] showed that the frictional coefficient of fault material is very low (less than 0.1) indicating a very weak fault zone at least at the toe of the décollement. The results from both NanTroSEIZE and JFAST indicate that unexpected high-speed rupture took place at the <b>toe</b> of the <b>plate</b> boundary. This finding suggests we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the mechanical behavior of large-scale plate-boundary earthquakes.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{began at}} 1:00 p.m. EST and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race with the air temperature at [...] Rev. Dr. L. Ronald Durham, senior pastor of the Greater Friendship Baptist Church of Daytona Beach, Florida, began pre-race ceremonies by giving the invocation. Country music artist Martina McBride performed the national anthem, and Josh Duhamel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and movie director Michael Bay of the upcoming film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, gave the command for the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.; David Ragan, Joey Logano, and David Reutimann had {{to move to the}} rear of the grid due to changing to their back-up car. Wrecker (an elite team of Autobots) versions of Earnhardt, Jr.'s, Juan Pablo Montoya's, and Jimmie Johnson's cars led the field during the pace laps as well.Kurt Busch retained his pole position lead into the first corner, followed by outside polesitter Jeff Gordon.

40|$|Background: First metatarsophalangeal (MTP) {{arthrodesis}} using dorsal plate fixation is {{a common}} procedure for painful condi-tions of the great <b>toe.</b> Locked <b>plates</b> have become increasingly common for arthrodesis procedures in the foot, including the hallux MTP joint. The biomechanical advantages and disadvan-tages of these plates are currently unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare locked and nonlocked plates used for first MTP fusion for strength and stiffness. Materials and Methods: The first ray of nine matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric feet underwent dissection, preparation with cup-and-cone reamers, and fixation of the MTP joint with a compression screw and either a nonlocked or locked stainless steel dorsal plate. Each specimen was loaded in a cantilever fashion to 90 N at a rate of 3 Hz for a total of 250, 000 cycles. The amount of plantar MTP gap was recorded using a calibrated extensometer.

40|$|The {{results of}} linear elastic finite element {{analyses}} of stress concentration factor (SCF) and through-thickness stress distribution for 80 weld <b>toe</b> T-butt <b>plate</b> geometries {{are presented in}} parametric form for tension (membrane) loading. The closed-form solutions, which describe the stress state of the two-dimensional plane stress models studied in terms of weldment angle, weld toe radius, weld attachment width and plate thickness, are accurate and wide ranging. The SCF is presented in full parametric form and also as a simple reduced expression, quantifying the degree of error from raw data in each case. An expression for the stress distribution through the potential Mode I crack plane of the uncracked geometries is also presented in full parametric form. It is anticipated that these HBC equations will be particularly useful in the calculation of weight functions for stress intensity factors (SIFs) of fatigue cracks emanating from weld toes in T-butt welded joints, especially {{in the presence of}} known residual stresses, or those resulting from peening. © 2014, Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The plantar {{plate is}} a rarely seen, yet central {{structure}} to the lesser metatarsal phalangeal (MP) joint. Thirty ca-daver lesser MP joints were studied {{to obtain a}} detailed description of the plate, including its dimensions, con-nections, and histology. The plate was found to be made of fibrocartilage with fiber orientation which suggests that it withstands tensile loads in line with the plantar fascia as well as the compressive loads from the meta-tarsal head. The plantar plate was the most substantial distal insertion of the plantar fascia. Impressive plantar plate attachments were noted to the proximal phalanx, the major longitudinal bands of the plantar fascia, and the collateral ligaments. The plate and collateral liga-ments formed a substantial soft tissue box connected to the sides of the metatarsal head. From the dissections, it is apparent that malposition of the toe at the MP joint is likely over time to be associated with pathology in both the collateral ligaments and the plate. Because of these attachments and a close association with the flexor ten-dons to the lesser <b>toe,</b> the <b>plate</b> can be compared with the sesamoid mechanism of the first MP joint...|$|R
5000|$|During the 2011-12 Eredivisie season, Vertonghen {{emerged as}} one of Ajax's best players, demonstrating his {{versatility}} to cover multiple positions after Ajax had let several regular players out on long-term loans. After an impressive season, including a performance for which he was singled out for praise against Manchester United in the UEFA Europa League Round of 16, he was named the 2011-12 Eredivisie Player of the Year. Named team captain by Frank de Boer, he led his Ajax to their second title in a row, scoring eight goals in 31 league games, highlighting his attacking strengths. Also, for the second time, he dropped the Championship plate. [...] "Now it falls on my <b>toe</b> - this <b>plate</b> just does not like me," [...] Vertonghen said.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of the modified plantar plate tenodesis for correction of claw toe deformity. Materials and Methods: Modified plantar plate tenodesis was performed in ten fresh frozen cadaveric feet with claw toe deformity of the second <b>toe.</b> The plantar <b>plate</b> of the second metatarsophalangeal joint was anchored to the extensor digitorum longus tendon by a figure-of-eight suture. The figure-of-eight construct and the relationship of the digital nerve and the suture were studied. A clinical study was conducted to study the operative times, degree of correction and the improvement of AOFAS score between groups with the original plantar plate tenodesis (Group 1) and modified technique (Group 2). Any neural injury if present was also noted. Result: In the cadaveric study, the claw toe deformity was corrected and no nerve injury occurred in any specimen. There was flexor tendon tethering by the suture in 2 specimens. In the clinical study, the average operative time was 51 minutes for Group 1 and 31 minutes for Group 2. The improvement in AOFAS score averaged 44 in Group 1 and 43 in Group 2. The corrective power of the sagittal plane deformity at the metatarsophalangeal joint averaged 25 degrees in Group 1 and 23 degrees in Group 2. Conclusion: Plantar plate tenodesis was effective in correction of flexible claw second toe deformity by stabilization of the attenuated plantar plate. The modified technique allowed easier retrieval of the suture and shorter operative time. However, it may result in tethering of the flexor tendon.
