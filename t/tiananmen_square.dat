5|$|The <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|The camera of the CCTV footage zooms in on {{the scene}} as it unfolds; {{surveillance}} cameras in <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> are usually fixed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> {{was one of}} {{the main}} venues where Falun Gong {{practitioners}} gathered to protest the persecution, usually by raising banners in defence of the group, or stage peaceful meditation sit-ins. Ian Johnson of the Wall Street Journal estimated that by 25 April 2000, more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested for attempting to demonstrate in Beijing, most of them in or on the way to <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b> Seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the Square on 1 January 2001.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, as {{multiple}} Chinese activists began {{preparing for}} the 25th anniversary of the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989, a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations. Among those arrested was Pu Zhiqiang, a lawyer {{who was involved in}} organising the demonstrations in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In September 1949, Liu Geping was {{selected}} as an ethnic minority representative to attend {{the first meeting of}} the Communist-led Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; he was ranked first among minority delegates. At the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, he {{was selected}} to speak in <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> as the official representative of China's minority peoples.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} {{participants}} on <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> was also {{called into question}} by a CNN producer on the scene. While the Chinese government claimed that a 12-year-old Liu Siying had set herself on fire {{at the urging of}} her mother, the CNN producer said that she did not see any children among the self-immolators.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{dismissal}} caused political shockwaves unseen {{since the}} <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989, and exposing internal conflicts within Communist Party. In the weeks following 15 March, party authorities deliberated on Bo's case. In {{the absence of}} official reports of the proceedings, microblogs churned out a flood of speculation, including rumours of a coup. In response, the authorities instructed newspapers and websites to strictly report only official releases, and arrested six people accused of 'rumourmongering'.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time in his career, Jackson made a second music video for a single. This second version was filmed in a prison with cell mates; in the video Jackson is seen handcuffed. It also {{contains}} real footage of police attacking African Americans, the military crackdown of the protest in the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> the Ku Klux Klan, war crimes, genocide, execution, martial law, and other human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|The program {{suggests}} that the reaction time of state-run television crews and police on <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> demonstrates they had advance knowledge of the event. They observed that officers arrived almost immediately on the scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers are not standard equipment for police on Tiananmen Square; the nearest building that would house them was several minutes away from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was officially}} opened in 2000, {{but has been}} closed for {{renovation}} since at least February 2008. While it was open, visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex; the Underground City was popular with foreign tourists but remained virtually forgotten by local citizens. Though {{there are many other}} entrances, foreign visitors entered approved sections accessed via a small shop front in Qianmen, south of <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> at 62 West Damochang Street. Tour groups could enter free of charge and without prior permission while individual tourists not part of a group were charged 20 yuan (US$2.40) each.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ningbo in 1964, Gui {{graduated}} from Peking University with a bachelor's degree in history in 1985. Gui served as editor to the People's Education Press until 1988, when he departed for Sweden, and {{enrolled in a}} doctoral program at the University of Gothenburg. After the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989, he obtained Swedish residency, and later became a naturalised citizen of Sweden, upon which he renounced his Chinese citizenship. According to his daughter, he was attracted to the beauty of his adopted country and the freedom he felt living there. Gui obtained his PhD in 1996. Gui's wife is also a naturalised Swedish citizen; the couple's daughter was born in 1994.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student leader at the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, in {{response}} to an uprising in Benghazi against his rule, held up China's 1989 military assault on <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> {{as an example of how}} to deal with popular unrest. Chinese media censored Gaddafi's reference to <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests were {{sparked by}} the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 {{students}} had gathered at <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall. The movement lasted for seven weeks.|$|E

The 127th Division moved northeast through Liuliqiao, Guanganmen, Caishikou, Hufangqiao, Hepingmen, to {{the southern edge of}} <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b> The 162nd Division moved west to Muxiyuan and then north to Majiapu, Taiping Street, Tianqiao and then <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{worked as}} {{the chief of the}} Party General Office between 1986 and 1993, and {{accompanied}} Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang to <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> during the 1989 <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests. In 1998, he was promoted to the post of Vice Premier under Premier Zhu Rongji, his mentor, and oversaw the broad portfolios of agriculture and finance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> {{protests of}} 1989 {{began with the}} mass {{mourning}} {{over the death of}} former General secretary Hu Yaobang, widely perceived to have been purged for his support of political liberalization. On the eve of Hu's funeral, 100,000 people gathered at <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b> Beijing students began the demonstrations to encourage continued economic reform and liberalization, and these demonstrations soon evolved into a mass movement for political reform. From <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> the protesters later expanded into the surrounding streets. Non-violent protests also occurred in cities throughout China, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Looting and rioting occurred in various locations throughout China, including Xi'an and Changsha.|$|E

25|$|During the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> {{protests of}} spring 1989, Ye Fei {{signed a letter}} {{opposing}} the enforcement of martial law by the Army in Beijing.|$|E
25|$|Outside China, {{the square}} {{is best known}} for the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989, an armed {{suppression}} of a pro-democracy movement in June 1989 by the Chinese government.|$|E
25|$|Line 1, a {{straight}} east-west line underneath Chang'an Avenue, which bisects the city through <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b> Line1 connects major commercial centres, Xidan, Wangfujing, Dongdan and the Beijing CBD.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of the censorship, in 2013, 24 years after the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989, online {{searches}} for the term 'Tiananmen Square' were still censored by Chinese authorities.|$|E
25|$|Small {{spontaneous}} gatherings {{to mourn}} Hu began on April 15 around Monument to the People's Heroes at <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square.</b> On the same day, many students at Peking University (PKU) and Tsinghua University erected shrines, {{and joined the}} gathering in <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began {{on a small scale}} in Xi'an and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL) made a large wreath to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled. At five p.m., 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the Great Hall of the People, near <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police intervened and attempted to disperse the students by persuasion.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{also decided}} to {{continue}} with the arms embargo, which had been imposed upon the PRC after the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> Massacre and which had been set to expire in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Hu's {{position}} as Party general secretary {{was taken by}} Zhao Ziyang, who continued many of Hu's economic and political reforms. A day after Hu's death, in 1989, a small-scale demonstration commemorated him and demanded that the government reassess his legacy. A week later, the day before Hu's funeral, some 100,000 students marched on <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square,</b> leading to the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989. Following the government's suppression of the 1989 protests, the Chinese government censored the details of Hu's life inside mainland China, but it officially rehabilitated his image and lifted its censorship restrictions on the 90th anniversary of Hu's birth, in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable events are protests during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of China by Mao Zedong on October 1, 1949, the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests in 1976 {{after the death of}} Zhou Enlai, and the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> protests of 1989 after the death of Hu Yaobang, the latter resulted in military suppression. One of the most famous images that appears during these protests was when a man stood in front of a line of moving tanks and refused to move, which was captured on Chang'an Avenue near the square.|$|E
25|$|A primetime special {{hosted by}} Tom Brokaw honored both the <b>Tiananmen</b> <b>Square</b> pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing {{and the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in that momentous year for human rights around the world, 1989.|$|E
