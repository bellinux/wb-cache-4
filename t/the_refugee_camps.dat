Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.|$|E

5|$|By late 1996, Hutu militants {{from the}} camps were {{launching}} regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi {{group in the}} Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps,</b> targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north western provinces. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, {{many of whom had}} lived in <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A cross {{sectional}} {{survey was conducted}} to compare parent background, child rearing practices, nutritional and morbidity status of under-five children in two study populations located in Tamilnadu, India- a Tamil <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> from Sri Lanka and a local Fishermen community. A total of 125 and 136 under-five children were contacted in <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> and <b>the</b> Fishermen community respectively. The literacy status of <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> parents (fathers = 92. 8 %, mothers = 89. 6 %) was higher than the Fishermen community parents (fathers = 77. 2 %, mothers = 72. 0 %). Mothers of <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> practiced significant longer duration of breastfeeding and earlier food supplementation. More than 90 % of the under-five children were fully immunised and about 35 % of them {{were found to be}} malnourished in both study populations. Fishermen community had significantly more number of children with pallor, lymphadenopathy, dental caries and respiratory infection. Under-five children of <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> have a better health status than the local Fishermen community which possibly is due to higher literacy status and better child rearing practices by <b>the</b> <b>Refugee</b> <b>camp</b> mothers.

5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was the dismantling of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps,</b> Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, {{with as many as}} 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dismantling <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps,</b> Kagame began planning {{a war to}} remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Uganda, the Rwandan government supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting, and controlling the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile, and the country was renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998, and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This war lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame says he did not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.|$|E
