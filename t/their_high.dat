5|$|In the 16th century, the {{fishermen}} {{started to work}} in maritime activities, as pilots or seafarers in {{the crew of the}} Portuguese ships, due to <b>their</b> <b>high</b> nautical knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to <b>their</b> <b>high</b> technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.|$|E
5|$|The July and August Category5s reached <b>their</b> <b>high</b> intensities in {{both the}} Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. These are the areas most {{favorable}} for tropical cyclone development in those months.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} model, {{manufacturers}} 1 and 3 achieve <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> profits under the MS-Stackelberg approach and the manufacturers 2 and 4 achieve <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> profits under the MS-Bertrand approach.

25|$|An {{advantage}} {{of this type of}} supercapacitors is <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> voltage and correspondingly <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> specific energy (up to 10-20Wh/kg (36-72kJ/kg)).|$|R
25|$|All {{commercial}} hybrid supercapacitors are asymmetric. They combine an electrode {{with high}} amount of pseudocapacitance with an electrode {{with a high}} amount of double-layer capacitance. In such systems the faradaic pseudocapacitance electrode with <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> capacitance provides high specific energy while the non-faradaic EDLC electrode enables high specific power. An advantage of the hybrid-type supercapacitors compared with symmetrical EDLC's is <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> specific capacitance value as well as <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> rated voltage and correspondingly <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> specific energy.|$|R
5|$|This is {{an option}} for 11th and 12th grade students, who have {{completed}} all of <b>their</b> <b>high</b> school requirements, to jointly enroll at Auburn University or Southern Union State Community College. Students may receive college credit only for these courses.|$|E
5|$|With <b>their</b> <b>high</b> profile, such schools {{formed the}} popular {{image of a}} direct grant grammar school, but they {{accounted}} for only {{about a quarter of}} them.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study by}} Forbes ranked the Sounders {{number one in}} the league in terms of annual {{revenues}} ($50million) and operating income ($10million). Consequently, the Sounders were also ranked as the most valuable franchise ($245million) in MLS– a 717% increase over the expansion fee it paid to join the league. The Sounders financial success is driven in large part by <b>their</b> <b>high</b> attendance figures.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. <b>Their</b> <b>high</b> perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) can be {{deposited}} by {{catalytic decomposition}} of borazine at a temperature ~1100 °C in a {{chemical vapor deposition}} setup, over areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices. BN nanosheets are also excellent proton conductors. <b>Their</b> <b>high</b> proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance, may lead to applications in fuel cells and water electrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Candidates must {{be between}} 17 and 23 years old, unmarried, {{and with no}} legal {{obligation}} to support a child. Above average high school and/or previous college grades, and strong performance on standardized testing is expected.

50|$|Active {{labour market}} {{policies}} are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers {{than in the previous}} models, {{this is one of the}} reasons explaining <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> income dispersion and <b>their</b> <b>higher</b> number of low-wage employments.|$|R
5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. <b>Their</b> <b>high</b> yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. <b>Their</b> <b>high</b> protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1975, Northern Lights College has {{a campus}} in Dawson Creek that houses its Regional Administration and two Centres of Excellence.

25|$|Jokers High Alternate: Similar to Jokers High above, if the Big Joker is led, opponents {{must play}} <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> spade in that trick. If the Big Joker is played during a hand, opponents are not forced to play <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> spade. This {{variation}} makes bidding more complex, as one cannot count on <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> spade as winning a trick, Big Joker excepted. This variation is commonly played with all 54 cards, using the Kitty dealing variation above.|$|R
5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. <b>Their</b> <b>high</b> value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and other methods of deception.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used <b>their</b> <b>high</b> bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} because of <b>their</b> <b>high</b> ratio of surface area to weight. However, the {{increased surface area}} makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E
25|$|England's {{score of}} 333 was <b>their</b> <b>highest</b> score against Australia, {{and the highest}} ODI total without a six.

If membership is relinquished, it cannot be reclaimed.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{has yielded}} at least 64 {{isoquinoline}} alkaloids, which include anti-parasitic (e.g. candimine) and psychopharmacological activity due to <b>their</b> <b>high</b> alkaloid content.
