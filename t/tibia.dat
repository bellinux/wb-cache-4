5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the <b>tibia,</b> forming a tibiotarsus. The <b>tibia</b> was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a <b>tibia,</b> and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The <b>tibia</b> has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{subfamily}} of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of locomotive behaviour {{of an animal}} necessitates the knowledge not only about its neural activity {{but also about the}} transformation of this activity patterns into muscle activity. The stick insect is a well studied system with respect to its motor output which is shaped by the interplay between sensory signals, the central neural networks for each leg joint and the coordination between the legs. The muscles of the FT (femur-tibia) joint are described in their morphologies and their motoneuronal innervation patterns, however little is known about how motoneuronal stimulation affects their force development and shortening behaviour. One of the two muscles moving the joint is the extensor <b>tibiae,</b> which is particularly suitable for such an investigation as it features only three motoneurons that can be activated simultaneously, which comes close to a physiologically occuring activation pattern. Its antagonist, the flexor <b>tibiae,</b> has a more complex innervation and a biomechanical investigation is only reasonable at full motoneuronal recruitment. Muscle force and length changes were measured using a dual-mode lever system that was connected to the cut muscle tendon. Both tibial muscles of all legs were studied in terms of their geometry: extensor <b>tibiae</b> muscle length changes with the cosine of the FT joint angle, while flexor <b>tibiae</b> length changes with the negative cosine, except for extreme angles (close to 30 ° and 180 °). For all three legs, effective flexor <b>tibiae</b> moment arm length (0. 564 mm) is twice that of the extensor <b>tibiae</b> (0. 282 mm). Flexor <b>tibiae</b> fibres are 1. 5 times longer (2. 11 mm) than extensor <b>tibiae</b> fibres (1. 41 mm). Active isometric force measurements demonstrated that extensor <b>tibiae</b> single twitch force is notably smaller than its maximal tetanical force at 200 Hz (2 - 6 mN compared to 100 - 190 mN) and {{takes a long time to}} decrease completely (> 140 ms). Increasing either frequency or duration of the stimulation extends maximal force production and prolongs the relaxation time of the extensor <b>tibiae.</b> The muscle reveals `latch´ properties in response to a short-term increase in activation. Its working range is on the ascending limb of the force-length relationship (see Gordon et al. (1966 b)) with a shift in maximum force development towards longer fibre lengths at lower activation. The passive static force increases exponentially with increasing stretch. Maximum forces of 5 mN for the extensor, and 15 mN for the flexor <b>tibiae</b> occur within the muscles´ working ranges. The combined passive torques of both muscles determine the rest position of the joint without any muscle activity. Dynamically generated forces of both muscles can become as large as 50 - 70 mN when stretch ramps mimick a fast middle leg swing phase. FT joint torques alone (with ablated muscles) do not depend on FT joint angle, but on deflection amplitude and velocity. Isotonic force experiments using physiological activation patterns demonstrate that the extensor <b>tibiae</b> acts like a low-pass filter by contracting smoothly to fast instantaneous stimulation frequency changes. Hill hyperbolas at 200 Hz vary a great deal with respect to maximal force (P 0) but much less in terms of contraction velocity (V 0) for both tibial muscles. Maximally stimulated flexor <b>tibiae</b> muscles are on average 2. 7 times stronger than extensor <b>tibiae</b> muscles (415 mN and 151 mN), but contract only 1. 4 times faster (6. 05 mm/s and 4. 39 mm/s). The dependence of extensor <b>tibiae</b> V 0 and P 0 on stimulation frequency can be described with an exponential saturation curve. V 0 increases linearly with length within the muscle´s working range. Loaded release experiments characterise extensor and flexor <b>tibiae</b> series elastic components as quadratic springs. The mean spring constant of the flexor <b>tibiae</b> is 1. 6 times larger than of the extensor <b>tibiae</b> at maximal stimulation. Extensor <b>tibiae</b> stretch and relaxation ramps show that muscle relaxation time constant slowly changes with muscle length, and thus muscle dynamics have a long-lasting dependence on muscle length history. High-speed video recordings show that changes in tibial movement dynamics match extensor <b>tibiae</b> relaxation changes at increasing stimulation duration...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Fracture healing {{complications}} due {{to limited}} vascularisation after reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing, the intraosseal {{course of the}} human arteria nutricia <b>tibiae</b> and its impairment by the intramedullary nailing needs an actual analysis. Method: The arteria nutricia of 26 corps <b>tibiae</b> were figured by injection with Technovit? and lead-Mennige. In 14 <b>tibiae</b> the cavum medullare was opened by frontal saw-cut before they were macerated. The other 12 <b>tibiae</b> were nailed by equal parts of the unreamed and the reamed nailing and x-ray photographs were taken. Results: After {{the passage of the}} compact bone the main trunk (truncus arteriae nutriciae <b>tibiae)</b> runs through a perforated bone-tunnel (pars tecta arteriae nutriciae <b>tibiae).</b> At its end (foramen nutricium internum) the vessel splits into an obligate descending branch and optional ascending branches and, which lays nearly close by the centromedial (pars libera arteriae nutriciae <b>tibiae).</b> The branches pass through horizontal bone lamellas which take a supporting part. Because of this topography the reamed nailing destroys the vessel completely in 100 %, the unreamed nailing in 16 % and partly in 50 %. Conclusion: Even the unreamed variant can destroy the nutritive vessel. Fracture as well as a transposition-osteotomy or corticotomy in the field of the pars tecta will result in impairment of the medullary blood supply with distinct consequence...|$|R

40|$|Leptin {{signaling}} deficient rodents {{have emerged}} as models of obesity/insulin resistance syndrome. Altered leptin signaling, however, can affect axial and appendicular bone geometrical properties differently, and, thus, we hypothesized that leptin-deficiency would differentially influence mechanical properties of vertebrae and <b>tibiae</b> compared to lean rats. Mature (9 [*]mo) leptin receptor deficient obese (cp/cp; n= 8) and lean (+/?; n= 7) male JCR:LA-corpulent rats were used to test that hypothesis. <b>Tibiae</b> and the sixth lumbar vertebrae (L 6) were scanned with micro-CT and were broken in three point-bending (<b>tibiae)</b> or axial loading (L 6). Supporting the hypothesis, vertebrae and <b>tibiae</b> were differentially affected by leptin signaling deficiency. <b>Tibiae,</b> but not vertebrae, were significantly shorter in obese rats and achieved a significantly greater load (> 18 %), displacement (> 15 %), and stress (> 18 %) at the proportional limit, relative to the lean rats.

5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The <b>tibia</b> and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the <b>tibia,</b> the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the <b>tibia</b> and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of microdamage in the <b>tibiae</b> and femora of rats following repetitive loading in vivo was investigated by subjecting 48 male rats, aged 12 weeks, to treadmill running (26. 8 m. min- 1 on 10 % grade) for 0. 56 hours (5, 000 cycles, E 1), 1. 13 hours, (10, 000 cycles, E 2), 2. 27 hours (20, 000 cycles, E 3), and 3. 4 hours (30, 000 cycles, E 4) with Group C as control. Following exercise, <b>tibiae</b> and femora were excised {{and the right}} limbs were tested in torsion at 180 °. sec- 1. Transverse sections were cut from the proximal, mid- and distal diaphysis of left <b>tibiae</b> and femora, bulk stained in basic fuchsin, cut to 50 μm thick, and examined for the {{presence of}} microdamage. Following these periods of loading, <b>tibiae</b> and femora showed no evidence of microdamage initiation, as evidenced by light microscopy, or corresponding alterations in mechanical properties. It was concluded that the magnitude of loading produced by single bouts of intensive exercise, which encompassed up to 30, 000 loading cycles, was insufficient to initiate fatigue microdamage in <b>tibiae</b> or femora of rats...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{normal and}} delayed bone healing by {{measuring}} ultrasound conduction velocity across the bone callus. METHODS: A model of transverse linear and 5 mm resection osteotomies of sheep <b>tibiae</b> was used. Fourteen sheep were operated on and {{were divided into}} two groups of seven according to osteotomy type. The procedure was performed on the right <b>tibiae</b> and the intact left <b>tibiae</b> were used as controls. The transverse and axial ultrasound velocities were measured at 30 -day intervals for 90 days, after which the animals were killed and both the right and left <b>tibiae</b> were resected for in vitro biomechanical analysis. RESULTS: Both the transverse and axial ultrasound velocities progressively increased, but the increase was smaller for the delayed union that resulted from the resection osteotomy. The mechanical resistance was higher for the normally healed <b>tibiae</b> that resulted from a linear osteotomy; this result closely correlated with the ultrasound velocity results. Significant differences were found for the comparisons between the intact and operated <b>tibiae</b> in both groups and between the groups for both the transverse and axial ultrasound velocities, but the differences were greater for the latter. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in vivo transverse and axial ultrasound velocities provide highly precise information about the healing state of both linear and resection diaphyseal osteotomies, but the axial ultrasound velocity most likely has greater discriminatory power. This method has the potential for clinical application in humans...|$|R
5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left <b>tibia,</b> right femur and right <b>tibia)</b> were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late Cretaceous India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} Cretaceous. It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material {{from the middle of the}} Cretaceous in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, but not with the South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms are united in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E
