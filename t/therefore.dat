5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and <b>therefore</b> could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and <b>therefore,</b> increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A. Not a {{habitable}} {{building and}} is <b>therefore</b> not ranked, {{but it is}} included in this list for comparative purposes.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in storage facilities do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and <b>therefore</b> the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will be especially efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged and are still developing in the seeds. Early harvest could <b>therefore</b> be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|And <b>therefore,</b> Sirs, {{you should}} not be severe.|$|E
5|$|As the game's BASIC {{source code}} was available, ports and remaster exist <b>therefore</b> by the fan community.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It is <b>therefore</b> very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and <b>therefore</b> not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|C1: <b>Therefore,</b> freedom {{does not}} by itself {{contribute}} to the wellbeing of non-human animals.|$|E
5|$|C2: <b>Therefore,</b> {{non-human}} {{animals do}} not have an intrinsic interest in freedom.|$|E
5|$|C3: <b>Therefore,</b> {{non-human}} {{animals do}} not have a moral right to freedom.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{assumptions}} are taken in its deduction, <b>therefore</b> Gibbs isotherm {{can only be}} applied to ideal (very dilute) solutions with two components.|$|E
5|$|Each vitamin is {{typically}} used in multiple reactions, and <b>therefore</b> most have multiple functions.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah is, <b>therefore,</b> deeply {{embedded}} in the Lebanese society.|$|E
5|$|I <b>therefore</b> {{write to}} ask you to accept my {{resignation}} as a Privy Councillor and to revoke my baronetcy.|$|E
5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. <b>Therefore,</b> there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows <b>therefore</b> that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce {{the things that are}} in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, <b>therefore,</b> who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? <b>Therefore,</b> God exists.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber used chaus as {{the species}} name and is <b>therefore</b> {{considered}} the binomial authority.|$|E
5|$|Infantes (young children) and furiosi ("lunatics") were {{considered}} incapable of formulating the necessary intention and could <b>therefore</b> not commit furtum.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{taught for}} some time at Musashino Art University, but he was {{disappointed}} by the students’ lack of sustained effort and <b>therefore</b> quit.|$|E
5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are <b>therefore</b> used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, <b>therefore</b> glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and <b>therefore</b> require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents <b>therefore</b> increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|Onions are, <b>therefore,</b> {{commonly}} {{employed in}} science education {{to teach the}} use of a microscope for observing cell structure.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and <b>therefore</b> behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should <b>therefore</b> readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 {{rely on the}} Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is <b>therefore</b> zero, and <b>therefore</b> the two values are the same.|$|E
5|$|The Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima, {{is a major}} {{nuisance}} pest in Australia, but native decomposers {{found in}} Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. <b>Therefore,</b> the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, {{to reduce the amount}} of dung and <b>therefore</b> also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but is using the stem cells of ram B and <b>therefore</b> producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A <b>therefore</b> has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E
5|$|The club {{prides itself}} on being non-sectarian and, <b>therefore,</b> not {{involved}} in the Old Firm division.|$|E
5|$|The larval {{stages of}} B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, and are <b>therefore</b> {{protected}} from any control measures, including chemical control. Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have <b>therefore</b> targeted adults either at colonization {{stage in the}} field or at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} these gifts {{has been a}} matter of {{scholarly}} disagreement and translations <b>therefore</b> vary.|$|E
5|$|The pointed tips of ZnO {{nanorods}} {{result in}} a strong enhancement of an electric field. <b>Therefore,</b> {{they can be used}} as field emitters.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{continued}} across Sydney Harbour {{and changed}} direction slightly {{to be heading}} north. It weakened after travelling over the Harbour, and was downgraded from a severe storm at 8:15pm. The Bureau of Meteorology had concluded that the storm would weaken after heading across Sydney Harbour, believing it was dissipating and would <b>therefore</b> not produce any more substantial hail as it moved northward; <b>therefore</b> it did not issue warnings for the northern suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The track numbers {{listed here}} do not <b>therefore</b> {{correspond}} to the original 1999 album.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>therefore</b> 2×4×81×2x1=1,296 {{different}} combinations of rules.|$|E
5|$|There was a tie {{for third}} place in the men's 500-metre event in speed skating, <b>therefore</b> two bronze medals were awarded.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>therefore</b> 179 {{direct grant}} grammar schools, {{alongside}} over 1200 maintained grammar schools.|$|E
5|$|<b>Therefore,</b> (by axiom S5) it is {{necessarily}} true that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Therefore,</b> God exists.|$|E
