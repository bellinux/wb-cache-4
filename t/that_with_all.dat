25|$|The {{issue of}} whether sublanguages should be {{included}} remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language {{is made up of}} lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.|$|E

25|$|Mary Bennett and David Percy {{have claimed}} in Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers, <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the known and unknown hazards, NASA would not risk {{broadcasting}} an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television. The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact did incur {{a great deal}} of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the Apollo 1 fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees. There was in fact no video broadcast during either the landing or takeoff because of technological limitations.|$|E
25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

Using a device he finds in the room, the Doctor reverses Cassandra's teleport and brings her back onto the station. In the elevated temperature and without moisturising, Cassandra begins to dry out and crack. She begs for mercy from the Doctor, but he refuses to listen and Cassandra ruptures. Rose notes <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the events that occurred no one had witnessed the actual destruction of Earth. The Doctor returns Rose to her present time, and explains {{to her that he}} is the last of the Time Lords, and that his planet of Gallifrey was destroyed {{in the wake of a}} great war. The episode closes with Rose and the Doctor going off to get chips on a sunny London afternoon.|$|E

5000|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, {{a central}} charge is an operator Z <b>that</b> commutes <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the other symmetry operators. The adjective [...] "central" [...] {{refers to the}} center of the symmetry group—the subgroup of elements <b>that</b> commute <b>with</b> <b>all</b> other elements of the original group—often embedded within a Lie algebra. In some cases, such as two-dimensional conformal field theory, a central charge may also commute <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the other operators, including operators that are not symmetry generators.|$|R

500|$|The weapon {{fire on the}} set was {{considered}} dangerous, which led the crew {{to build a new}} bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in Hard Target where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera. These camera dollies were nicknamed by the crew as [...] "the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo". Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the Mardi Gras parade warehouse by recollecting that [...] "just the lighting for a space like <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> those strange shapes and shadows was difficult enough, but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once—often with more than one of the cameras moving". Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these types of action scenes.|$|E
500|$|Surfer Rosas cover artwork {{features}} {{a photograph of}} a topless [...] "friend of a friend" [...] of the band, posing as a flamenco dancer, pitched against a wall which displays a crucifix and a torn poster. Simon Larbalestier, who contributed pictures to all Pixies album sleeves, decided to build the set because [...] "we couldn't find the atmosphere we wanted naturally." [...] According to Larbalestier, Black Francis {{came up with the idea}} for the cover as he wrote songs in his father's [...] "topless Spanish bar"; Larbalestier added the crucifix and torn poster, and they [...] "sort of loaded <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the Catholicism." [...] Commenting on the cover in 2005, Francis said, [...] "I just hope people find it tasteful." [...] The cover booklet expands on the theme, and features photographs of the flamenco dancer in several other poses; there are no song lyrics or written content, apart from album credits, in the booklet.|$|E
500|$|David Balls from Digital Spy noted Gaga's {{homage to}} her Italian-American {{roots in the}} video, but {{wondered}} if Gaga would [...] "overexpose herself" [...] with the video. Like his review of the single, Moralde found the video to be complimenting the simplistic composition of the song. He believed that with the videos for previous singles, [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga. He explained: [...] "What's striking about it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and spaghetti and meatballs." [...] He noted <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of these activities, Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse, by playing feminine characters.|$|E

500|$|Quinn's car {{accident}} has {{left her in}} a wheelchair, suffering from a severely compressed spine. By [...] "Prom-asaurus" [...] {{she is able to}} stand and to walk a few steps in the sessions. When Quinn is nominated for prom queen, Finn agrees to campaign with her, but is outraged when he discovers that she has been hiding the fact that she can now stand for the sympathy vote. When Quinn and Santana count the votes, they discover that Finn has won and so has Quinn. Quinn realizes that the victory means nothing. She and Santana falsely report the prom queen results as a write-in victory for Rachel. Her recovery is rapid enough to allow her to dance in the [...] "Nationals" [...] competition episode, which New Directions wins. Quinn helps Puck study for the test he needs to pass in order to graduate. She tells him <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> they went through, they are bonded for life, and she kisses him. Emboldened, Puck passes his test. Later, Quinn returns her cheerleading uniform to Sue, and the two have a tearful farewell.|$|E
500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living." ...|$|E
500|$|Alwyn W.

[...] Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that the album [...] "flaunts the less sizzling, though equally galvanizing, highlights of her career." [...] She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track [...] "You'll See" [...] which became [...] "the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying [...] "It was interesting <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of his [...] exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna {{would come up with}} two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded—but such is the excitement of collaboration; one never knows what will come of it." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs [...] "show a great leap in sophistication" [...] and felt that Madonna [...] "has invested much in improving her vocal technique." [...] Robert Christgau criticized the album with a [...] "dud" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen award {{the season}} a [...] "C", calling it [...] "a straight-up disappointment." [...] Calling the early episodes with Daredevil's {{face-off}} with the Punisher [...] "skimpy and sluggish from the get-go", Jensen also added {{that they were}} [...] "a flatline of inert drama, with long scenes of windy exposition or dull skulking interrupted by the occasional well-staged if ridiculously gory fight sequence." [...] Jensen added that [...] "hope for improvement" [...] came {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, and that the sixth episode should be a template {{for the rest of the}} season, which ultimately, he felt was [...] "stiff and silly." [...] Daniel D'Addario for Time was also disappointed with the season, saying, [...] "it’s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long, and not particularly enjoyable, ride... Daredevil just wants to dole out fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan. Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark." [...] Vulture's Abraham Riesman joined the criticism, calling the seven episodes reviewed [...] "a dour parade of one cliché after another, recycling themes, images, and rhetoric that audiences have seen countless times before." [...] Though he wouldn't call it [...] "", he felt <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the other superhero content released in the same year, [...] "it feels woefully unnecessary." [...] However, he did praise Bernthal's performance, saying it was [...] "another excitingly sympathetic antagonist" [...] after D'Onofrio's [...] "standout performance" [...] as Fisk in the first season, but was [...] "nowhere near as fun". In contrast to the first season of Jessica Jones, which Riseman called Marvel's [...] "first attempt to depict sex in any kind of realistic way", he called the second season of Daredevil [...] "astoundingly un-sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, Middlemarch {{continued}} to provoke contrasting responses; while her father Leslie Stephen dismissed the novel in 1902, Virginia Woolf described the novel in 1919 as [...] "the magnificent book <b>that,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> its imperfections, is one of the few English novels written for grown-up people". However, Woolf was [...] "virtually unique among the modernists in her unstinting praise for Middlemarch, and the novel also remained overlooked by the reading public of the time.|$|E

[...] The book was {{originally intended to}} be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography. He further explained: [...] "One would just kind of assume <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the [...] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy. [...] But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than both of my parents', or any of my friends'. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't ... were we there?'" [...] The book was an international bestseller.|$|E
2500|$|The FDA held {{an expert}} panel in December 2006 {{to go over}} the data {{presented}} by Cordis and Boston Scientific to determine if drug eluting stents should be considered less safe than bare metal stents. [...] It became evident at the meeting <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the data published there were varied definitions of late thrombosis and key differences in the types of lesions in different studies, hampering analysis of the data. [...] It was also noted that with the advent of drug eluting stents, interventional cardiologists began performing procedures on more complex lesions, subsequently using the drug eluting stents in [...] "off label" [...] coronary artery lesions, which would otherwise go untreated or for bypass surgery. [...] The FDA advisory board reiterated the ACC guidelines that clopidogrel should be continued for 12 months after drug eluting stent placement in individuals who are at low risk for bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Night of the Doctor", Paul McGann reprised {{his role}} as the Eighth Doctor from the 1996 {{television}} film and subsequent Big Finish audio plays. He is a conscientious objector to the ongoing Time War and intends to rescue a crew member from a crashing spaceship via the TARDIS. Realising that her rescuer is a Time Lord she refuses to comply, preferring to die rather than go with him. She and the Doctor die as the ship crashes on Karn. The Doctor is resurrected temporarily by the Sisterhood of Karn (who control a secret Elixir of Life in the 1976 serial The Brain of Morbius). They persuade the Doctor to take action to end the Time War, offering him a selection of potions to control his regeneration. He reluctantly accepts <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of reality threatened and the universe [...] "on the brink", there is not much need for a doctor, and chooses a potion designed to initiate his regeneration into a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor as a [...] "warrior" [...] (described in credits as the [...] "War Doctor" [...] and played by John Hurt).|$|E
