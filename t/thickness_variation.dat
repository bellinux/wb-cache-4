These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage.

The resulting elastic <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> are studied in relation to the different geodynamic areas involved, considering also the seismicity.

2500|$|The use of {{reflection}} causes wafer exposure {{position to be}} extremely sensitive to the reticle flatness and the reticle clamp. Reticle clamp cleanliness is therefore required to be maintained. Small (mrad-scale) deviations in mask flatness in the local slope, coupled with wafer defocus. More significantly, mask defocus {{has been found to}} result in large overlay errors. [...] In particular, for a 10nm node metal 1 layer (including 48 nm, 64 nm, 70 nm pitches, isolated, and power lines), the uncorrectable pattern placement error was 1 nm for 40 nm mask z-position shift. This is a global pattern shift of the layer with respect to previously defined layers. However, features at different locations will also shift differently due to different local deviations from mask flatness, e.g., from defects buried under the multilayer. It can be estimated that the contribution of mask non-flatness to overlay error is roughly 1/40 times the peak-to-valley <b>thickness</b> <b>variation.</b> With the blank <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> up to 80 nm being possible, ~2 nm image placement error is possible.|$|E
2500|$|This type of <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> {{has many}} causes, {{but there are}} three primary {{mechanisms}} which contribute the most to the propagation of disc thickness variations connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} x-ray radiography to measure <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> of coatings on laser fusion targets. Our technique {{is based on}} measuring the variation in x-ray transmission through the targets. The simplest targets are hollow glass microshells* or microballoons** 100 to 500 μm in diameter (Fig. 1), that have several layers of metals or plastics, 1 to 100 ym thick (Fig. 2). Our goal is to examine these opaque coatings for <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> as small as 1 % or 0. 1 %, {{depending on the type}} of defect. Using contact radiography we have obtained the desired sensitivity for concentric and elliptical defects of 1 %. This percentage corresponds to <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> as small as 100 A in a 1 -μm-thick coating.

50|$|Sediment {{thickness}} {{along the}} Sumatra Trench varies significantly, {{which is the}} result of fracture zones and fossil ridges' influence on basement topography. The thickness is a function of oceanic basement topography in some extent and this feature is extremely distinctive in the part between Simeulue and Siberut Islands (Central Sumatra region 2°N to 3°S) along the trench. This sediment <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> then leads to thin and variable sediment cover in many places, sometimes hinders the sediment transportation along the Sumatra Trench.
