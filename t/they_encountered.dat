5|$|Stoneman and Burbridge {{continued}} on toward Marion where <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> Witcher and his men. Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped {{just so they}} could fire a volley into the Union cavalry. They then continued to retreat toward Marion. Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{forces at}} Kranji {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} by the Imperial Guards Division led by Major General Takuma Nishimura. 400 Imperial Guards had landed and taken Pulau Ubin, {{an island in the}} north-east of Singapore, in a feint attack on 7 February, where <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> minimal resistance.|$|E

The rest of the book follows the formula of each new world <b>they</b> <b>encounter</b> being destroyed in the battle between the two imps, Bat-Mite fleeing and Mxyzptlk pursuing to another universe/world which is then destroyed. In the process they generally mock the characters/comics <b>they</b> <b>encounter,</b> often breaking the 4th wall and lampooning how seriously people [...] "inside" [...] comics take themselves given the often unbelievable or silly circumstances <b>they</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Grand Master's new fleet {{was ready}} in port by 1706 and was {{headed by the}} same knight of St. Pierre. Three large vessels were {{launched}} that year by the names St. Vincent, St. Joseph and St. Raymond. Shortly afterwards, the fleet sailed west, where <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> three Tunisian vessels, {{one of which was}} seized and incorporated into the fleet under the name of Santa Croce.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the next}} week scouts from the army were sent through the {{northern}} townships of Columbia County. The scouts failed to find any evidence of a military uprising. They raided hen roosts, cornfields, and pigpens that <b>they</b> <b>encountered.</b> At this point Major General George Cadwalader arrived to take command of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied prisoners {{who were being}} {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him to}} the fort. Along the way <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> other Indians, who shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E

5|$|Zur's {{maneuver}} sent Israel's {{forces into}} unknown territory, and <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> an Egyptian entrenchment that caught them unawares. His original {{plan was to}} send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi's company, but when fire was opened on Harpaz's men (at approximately 04:00), Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault. Harpaz decided {{to do this in}} three single-platoon waves: the first two would attack the Egyptians, while the third would provide cover for the forces. The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt's army. After advancing, <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> what were probably Bren carriers, which their commander reported were tanks. Harpaz then sent the second, more experienced, platoon of 15 men, who were also able to better utilize the cover fire. Eventually, the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered to do so and the attack was only two platoons strong. However, this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer {{on the other side of}} the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops.|$|E
5|$|After landing, {{members of}} Company E under Captain Leveridge {{were sent to}} take the {{railroad}} station, while Ellsworth, Major Charles Loeser, Lieutenant H. J. Winser and several men from Company A set out to secure the telegraph office. On the way there, Ellsworth spotted a Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn. It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Allenby's {{force was}} {{deployed}} with infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 75th Division in the centre, the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank with the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry's left flank. He ordered the 52nd (Lowland) Division {{to extend their}} position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Ottoman right flank. And, reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> a determined and substantial Ottoman counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to repel}} Allied {{advances}} towards Bologna, the Germans took up positions on Monte Stanco overlooking the main roads towards the city. Two Allied assaults on the mountain—one by an Indian battalion, {{the other by}} the Royal Natal Carabineers—were repulsed. A third, larger attack at dawn on 13 October provided the Rhodesian Company of the Cape Town Highlanders {{with some of the}} fiercest combat <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> in Italy. Advancing up the slope on the Allied right flank while being fired on from two directions, they suffered heavy casualties but achieved their objective and held it. Both Rhodesian artillery batteries provided support during the assault.|$|E
5|$|However, Red Army {{resistance}} {{had slowed}} the Wehrmacht. When, on 10 October the Germans arrived {{within sight of}} the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, who had been recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, he ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The Luftwaffe still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and Stuka and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the Royal Navy, President and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with Endymion. During the journey, <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed Presidents masts and strained Endymions timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of President.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment {{moved toward}} Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout the day, <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1913, the Ottoman Navy and Army {{attempted}} a landing at Bozca Ada (Tenedos) to retake the island from the Greeks. Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest}} of the fleet supported the operation, but the appearance of the Greek fleet forced the Ottomans to break off the operation. The Greeks also withdrew, and several Ottoman cruisers opened fire as both sides departed, but no damage was done. By 15:30, Barbaros Hayreddin was back at Çanakkale inside the safety of the Dardanelles. On 10 January, the fleet conducted a patrol outside the Dardanelles. <b>They</b> <b>encountered</b> several Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw, but inflicted no damage on the Greek ships.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, Barrett {{instructed}} Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry {{to attack}} the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates surely had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise <b>they</b> <b>encountered</b> Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender.|$|E
