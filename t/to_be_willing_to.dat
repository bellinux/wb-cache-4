5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 per gram. In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price per gram was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{government}} {{during the}} early years of the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648–1687) was rife with factional disputes and power struggles. Thus in 1651, after three years of faithfully carrying out service overseeing the Yeni Il Türkmen, he was suddenly removed from office at the insistence of a palace faction of Ocak Aghas (cavalry commanders) led by Bektaş Agha. Despite the intercession of the Şeyhülislâm Karaçelebizade Abdulaziz Efendi, he was unable to regain his office. The grand vizier Melek Ahmed Pasha recognized the injustice which Abaza Hasan had suffered, but was too reliant on the support of the Aghas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> help. A contemporary source depicts him fuming with rage and swearing revenge upon the Ocak Aghas. Giving up on the legal means of recompense, he and his supporters left Istanbul and began gathering an army in Anatolia, demanding either the return of his office or 60,000 guruş (silver coins of foreign origin) in compensation.|$|E
25|$|Bryan {{was worried}} that the theory of {{evolution}} was gaining ground not only in the universities, but also within the church. Many colleges were still church-affiliated. The developments of 19th century liberal theology, and higher criticism in particular, had allowed many clergymen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> embrace {{the theory of evolution}} and claim that it was not contradictory with their being Christians. Determined {{to put an end to}} this, Bryan, who had long served as a Presbyterian elder, decided to run for the position of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, which was at the time embroiled in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. (Under Presbyterian church governance, clergy and laymen are equally represented in the General Assembly, and the post of Moderator is open to any member of the General Assembly.) Bryan's main competition in the race was the Rev. Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster in Ohio, who had loudly endorsed the teaching of the theory of evolution in the college. Bryan lost to Wishart by a vote of 451–427. Bryan failed in gaining approval for a proposal to cut off funds to schools where the theory of evolution was taught. Instead, the General Assembly announced disapproval of materialistic (as opposed to theistic) evolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} whether presenting buggieburgers as healthy or sustainable influences a consumer’s willingness {{to buy the}} product and whether this process is being influenced by individual or collective values. Furthermore, this study examines whether providing {{more information about the}} product leads to an increase of this willingness to buy. An interaction was expected between a consumer’s values and the way the buggieburgers were presented (i. e., healthy or sustainable). Specifically, consumers who attach a lot of importance <b>to</b> individual values <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> buy the healthy buggieburgers than the sustainable buggieburgers. On the other hand, consumers who attach a lot of importance <b>to</b> collective values <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> buy sustainable buggieburgers. Furthermore, there was expected that providing more information about the product would increase these interactions. In this study 251 participants have completed the Schwartz Value Inventory (SVI), reviewed buggieburgers packagings and answered questions about their knowledge and preferences regarding (quality) labels, health and sustainability. Based on their scores on the ten valuetypes by Schwartz (1992), all participants were granted a score on the independent variables individual and collective values. It has been found that participants in general <b>are</b> more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> buy the buggieburgers presented as healthy than as sustainable. Furthermore, participants who attach little importance to individual values appeared more inclined to buying buggieburgers presented as healthy than as sustainable. Without regard to values, adding more information about the product enhanced the willingness to buy. Besides, the control variables gender, age and the importance of sustainability labels were of influence on the willingness to buy buggieburgers. Men and younger consumers <b>were</b> more inclined <b>to</b> do so. Also, consumers who attach a lot of importance <b>to</b> sustainability <b>are</b> more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> buy buggieburgers and consumers who attach a lot of importance <b>to</b> labels <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay (WTP) more. These findings can be used by supermarkets, food brands and organizations involved with (quality) labels in an effort to enhance consumer’s acceptation towards eating insects and contribute to preventing an impending food shortage...|$|R
