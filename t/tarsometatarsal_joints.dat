5000|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin {{encountered}} {{a soldier who}} suffered from vascular compromise and secondary gangrene of the foot after a fall from a horse. Subsequently, Lisfranc performed an amputation {{at the level of}} the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> and that area of the foot has since been eponymously referred to as the [...] "Lisfranc joint". Although Lisfranc did not describe a specific mechanism of injury or classification scheme, a Lisfranc injury has come to mean a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|E
40|$|This is a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} presentation, di-agnosis, treatment, and outcome of 19 patients who injured the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> of the foot during ath-letic activity.

50|$|Anaesthesia of an {{affected}} joint {{is a more}} definitive way of {{confirming the}} presence of pain arising from that joint. Introduction of local anaesthetic into a joint should abolish or at least significantly lessen the lameness. This technique is not absolutely specific, as the distal pouches of the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> are immediately adjacent to the suspensory ligament. This means that anaesthetic in the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> can occasionally desensitize pain arising from suspensory ligament, giving the false impression that joint pain has been abolished.|$|R

50|$|Diabetes is the {{foremost}} cause in America today for neuropathic joint disease, and the foot {{is the most}} affected region. In those with foot deformity, approximately 60% are in the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> (medial joints affected more than lateral), 30% Metatarsophalangeal joints and 10% have ankle disease. Over half of diabetic patients with neuropathic joints can recall some kind of precipitating trauma, usually minor.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} cadaver, experimental, radiographic and clinical studies on the relation between a hallux valgus deformity and mobility of the first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint.</b> Hypermobility of stiffnes of the joint was determined by Doppler imaging of vibrations and by radiographic stress measurement. With neither method a sharp distinction between hypermobility and non-hypermobility of the joint could be made. Comparison of the Hohmann surgical procedure with the Lapidus procedure showed no difference in clinical results at short term follow up.

50|$|When a Lisfranc {{injury is}} {{characterized}} by significant displacement of the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint(s),</b> nonoperative treatment often leads to severe loss of function and long-term disability secondary to chronic pain and sometimes to a planovalgus deformity. In cases with severe pain, loss of function, or progressive deformity that has {{failed to respond to}} nonoperative treatment, mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis (operative fusion of the bones) may be indicated.|$|E
5000|$|The human foot has two {{longitudinal}} arches and a transverse arch {{maintained by}} the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the [...] "keystone" [...] ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or flat feet.|$|E
40|$|The dorsal and plantar {{interosseous}} {{muscles of}} the foot arise, {{not only from the}} metatarsal bones, but also from ligamentous tissue proximal to the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> The interossei also take origin from the fascia of adjacent muscles, and the first dorsal interosseous muscle usually arises in part from a slip of the peroneus longus tendon. A means may thus exist to ensure that the interossei contract in a coordinated manner. Their positions and time of contraction during the gait cycle imply a possible role as stabilisers of the forefoot, rendering the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> rigid when weight is carried on the ball of the foot...|$|E
50|$|Other {{proximal}} fifth metatarsal fractures exist, {{although they}} are not as severe as a Jones fracture. If the fracture enters the intermetatarsal joint, it is a Jones fracture. If, however, it enters the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> then it is an avulsion fracture caused by pull from the peroneus brevis. An avulsion fracture is sometimes called a Pseudo-Jones fracture or a Dancer's fracture.|$|R

30|$|One {{disadvantage}} of calcaneotalotibial arthrodesis is that rigidity of the hind foot may predispose to secondary degenerative {{changes in the}} naviculocuneiform and <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> as was also shown {{to be the case}} after ankle and triple arthrodesis [9, 10, 15, 16, 27]. Although this is a potential hazard, we believe that prospective patients should be made aware of it as part of their informed consent.|$|E
30|$|Injuries to the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> are {{not common}} and {{represent}} less than 0.2 % of all orthopaedic injuries with a reported incidence of 1 per 55, 000 individuals [1]. The injury is commonly missed due to gross swelling masking the deformity and subtle findings on radiological evaluation which requires careful attention. Re-examination after {{the decrease in}} oedema for persistent pain and aggravation of pain or instability on stress examination warrants further investigation [2]. The Lisfranc joint injury is notorious for developing secondary arthritis if left untreated or treated with residual incongruity [3].|$|E
40|$|Primary {{synovial}} chondromatosis {{is a rare}} condition and commonly involves a single large joint, although it may involve any synovial joint. It {{occurs as a result}} of metaplasia and focal formation of cartilage in the intimal layer of the synovial membrane. Diagnosis could be made after thorough clinical and radiological assessment. Diagnosis must be confirmed by histopathological examination, because malignant transformation has been reported.

50|$|Peroneal group: peroneus longus arises on the {{proximal}} {{aspect of the}} fibula and peroneus brevis below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral malleolus. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> while peroneus brevis reaches {{the proximal}} part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{proximal}} correction {{site and}} long lever arm, the Lapidus fusion, modified or not, {{is a powerful}} technique to correct hallux valgus deformities. The disadvantages are a high complication rate and a long postoperative rehabilitation period. It is only performed in 5 % to 10 % of all hallux valgus deformity corrections but remains, however, an important procedure, especially in moderate to severe deformities with intermetatarsal angles more than 14 °, hypermobility of the first ray, arthritis of the first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> and recurrent deformities.

30|$|The {{joint index}} (JI) was {{calculated}} as described previously [3]. Briefly, joints {{were divided into}} four categories based on functional aspect: upper/large (UL: shoulder, sternoclavicular, elbow, and wrist joints), upper/small (US: proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints), lower/large (LL: hip, knee, ankle, and <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints),</b> and lower/small (LS: metatarsophalangeal joints). The JI {{for each of these}} categories is the sum of the number of tender and swollen joints divided by the number of evaluable joints in that category. JI is within the range of 0 – 2.|$|E
30|$|Soft tissue {{releases}} {{were always}} performed using loops magnification (× 4.5). An extended posteromedial incision was used, often {{in line with}} a previous posteromedial incision. The posterior tibial neurovascular bundle was identified and dissected free of scar. The tibialis posterior (TP), flexor digitorum longus (FDL) and flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendons were isolated along {{the entire length of}} the incision. The Achilles tendon was approached medially and in most cases, scaring was present between the Achilles tendon sheath and Achilles tendon itself. Posterior and medial dissection allowed visualization of the posteromedial aspects of the ankle joint, subtalar joint, and the medial and plantar and dorsal aspect of the talonavicular, navicular-cuneiforn and first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> Complete release by capsulotomies of the ankle, subtalar, talonavicular and first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> until mobilization of the ankle, hindfoot, and midfoot was obtained. In all cases, irrespective of the presence of a cavus deformity, a plantar fascia release was performed near its origin. Flexor digitorum brevis and hallux abductus muscles were also released from their proximal insertions to allow forefoot correction. The ankle joint posterior capsule release was necessary to correct hindfoot equinus. Medial releases were used to correct varus of the hindfoot and adduction of the midfoot. Calcaneocuboid release was used in two cases to realign the lateral border of the foot. After the release had been completed, the foot and the ankle were partially corrected and the Achilles, TP, FHL and FDL tendons were lengthened and repaired.|$|E
40|$|Following a Lisfranc joint injury, stable {{fixation}} of the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> {{is crucial}} to avoid deformity and posttraumatic osteoarthritis, but the ideal method of fixation remains controversial. Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation of all involved joints with cast immobilization resulted in loss of position, {{and was replaced by}} open reduction with improved fixation using transarticular screws. However, it seems intuitive that transarticular screws will result in further damage to already traumatized joints, and this has led to plate-spanning techniques. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the method of dorsal multiple plating without the routine use of transarticular screws, and to report on the ability of plate fixation to maintain alignment comparable to that of transarticular screw fixation in 15 patients.

40|$|Injuries to the <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> {{also known}} as Lisfranc injuries, are {{uncommon}} and can be diffi-cult to diagnose.

40|$|Background: Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation has been recommended as {{the treatment for}} most un-stable injuries of the Lisfranc (<b>tarsometatarsal)</b> <b>joint.</b> It has been thought that purely ligamentous injuries have a poor outcome despite such surgical management.

Among ninety-two adults treated for that injury, forty-eight pa-tients with forty-eight injuries were followed for an aver-age of fifty-two months (range, thirteen to 114 months).

40|$|Dislocation of {{the fourth}} and fifth <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> in {{conjunction}} with lateral subtalar dislocation is a rare occurrence.

In this report, we describe this atypical presentation in a middle aged, otherwise healthy male who sustained a trivial twisting injury to the ankle when he slipped and fell on ice. Open reduction and K-wire fixation were necessary to affix the lateral tarsometatarsal and talonavicular joints. At one year postoperatively, he was able to return to his preinjury occupation with mild to moderate pain with prolonged walking. His Foot and Ankle Disability Index and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were 64 and 65 points, respectively.

40|$|Six cadaver {{feet were}} used for {{radiological}} and com-puted tomographic (CT) evaluation. The <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> of each specimen were displaced dorsolaterally in successive 1 -mm increments. None of the 1 -mm and {{two thirds of the}} 2 -mm dorsolateral Lisfranc dislocations could be visualized on routine radiographs; they could all be noted on CT scans. There was good assessment on CT scan for the extent of the minor lesions that are normally obscured by overlapping projection in routine radiographs. A Lisfranc injury that appears undisplaced on radiographs or acceptable after closed reduction may still have an unpredictable outcome because of the pres-ence of an occult joint subluxation. CT scanning is more sensitive than radiography for detecting the minor amounts of Lisfranc displacement. If there is any doubt on the radiographs, a CT scan should be performed. The early diagnosis and treatment of Lisfranc injuries may minimize development of post-traumatic degenerative arthritis...|$|E
40|$|In some {{patients}} with painful flatfoot, realignment and arthrodesis of the medial naviculocuneiform and first <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joints</b> {{can be done}} to correct alignment and relieve symptoms. The primary purpose of this radiographic study was to assess the ability of isolated medial column arthrodesis to improve hindfoot alignment. We also assessed the ability of the procedure to correct radiographic parameters of overall foot structure in acquired flatfoot. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs of 19 patients who had naviculocuneiform and/or tarsometatarsal realignment and arthrodesis for adult-acquired flatfoot were examined by two reviewers. All parameters improved, with the lateral talometatarsal angle approaching normal. A decrease in talonavicular subluxation in the axial plane suggests passive improvement in hindfoot position without direct manipulation of any hindfoot bones or joints. These observations provide evidence for a link between stability of the midfoot and alignment of the hindfoot. In carefully selected patients, medial column realignment may restore normal anatomy without fusing essential joints. Modern clinical outcome studies are {{the next step in the}} objective evaluation of this procedure...|$|E

40|$|A cavovarus foot {{deformity}} was simulated in cadaver specimens {{by inserting}} metallic wedges of 15 degrees and 30 degrees dorsally {{into the first}} <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint.</b> Sensors in the ankle joint recorded static tibiotalar pressure distribution at physiological load. The peak pressure increased significantly from neutral alignment to the 30 degrees cavus deformity, and the centre of force migrated medially. The anterior migration of the centre of force was significant for both the 15 degrees (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), p = 0. 021) and the 30 degrees (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0. 007) cavus deformity.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we {{presented}} kinematic and kinetic data of foot joints by using passive elastic characteristics of joints during gait. During the calculation process we used approximate equations and partial plantar pressures. The maximum angular displacements of each <b>tarsometatarsal</b> <b>joint</b> ranged from 4 o to 7 o and the maximum moments were from 200 N⋅cm to 1500 N⋅cm. It was relatively wide distribution. Foot kinematic data calculated from the approximated equations, which were represented by the correlation between moment and angular displacement, and the data from motion analysis were very similar. We found that the movements of foot joints were mainly decided by the passive characteristics of the joints when ground reaction force acts.
