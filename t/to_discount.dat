5|$|By late 1869, enough nickels, as {{the coin}} {{came to be}} called, had been {{produced}} {{to meet the needs}} of commerce, and production dropped off. The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> the coins to brokers. Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It would not be until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that they have found to be abusing the review system.|$|E

25|$|Though {{he was an}} able {{military}} commander and proved a useful partisan of Caesar, Lepidus has always been portrayed as the weakest member of the triumvirate. He typically appears as a marginalised figure in depictions {{of the events of}} the era, most notably in Shakespeare's plays. While some scholars have endorsed this view, others argue that the evidence is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> the distorting effects of propaganda by his opponents, principally Cicero and, later, Augustus.|$|E
25|$|Van Helmont “had {{frequent}} visions {{throughout his}} life and laid great stress upon them.” His choice of a medical profession {{has been attributed to}} a conversation with the angel Raphael., and some of his writings described imagination as a celestial, and possibly magical, force. Though Van Helmont was skeptical of specific mystical theories and practices, he refused <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> magical forces as explanations for certain natural phenomena. This stance, reflected in a 1621 paper on sympathetic principles, may have contributed to his prosecution and subsequent house arrest.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that juries {{would find}} it {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> an implicating confession against a codefendant who stood alongside the confessor, the Court discounted such instructions. In a subsequent case, Parker, the Court was split on the same issue where each defendant had made his own confession. Writing in concurrence, Justice Blackmun argued that introduction of a codefendant's own interlocking confession could cause a harmless violation of the Confrontation Clause (he found such an example in that case), but {{that there were other}} foreseeable cases in which it could lead to a more harmful violation.|$|E

25|$|As a tool {{applied to}} making an {{investment}} decision, {{to decide whether}} a project adds value or not, comparing the IRR of a single project with the required rate of return, in isolation from any other projects, {{is equivalent to the}} NPV method. If the appropriate IRR (if such can be found correctly) is greater than the required rate of return, then using the required rate of return <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> cash flows to their present value, the NPV of that project will be positive, and vice versa. However, using IRR to sort projects in order of preference does not result in the same order as using NPV.|$|E
25|$|Duration is {{a linear}} {{measure of how}} {{the price of a}} bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond's price with respect <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> rates. For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond with a duration of 7 would fall about 7% if the market interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{cultural}} capital has received widespread attention {{all around the}} world, from theorists and researchers alike. It is mostly employed {{in relation to the}} education system, but on the odd occasion has been used or developed in other discourses. Use of Bourdieu's cultural capital can be broken up into a number of basic categories. First, are those who explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, are those who build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there are those who attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> them in favour of an alternative theory. The majority of these works deal with Bourdieu's theory in relation to education, only a small number apply his theory to other instances of inequality in society.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{economics}} {{has also}} been applied to intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different time. Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by George Ainslie's hyperbolic discounting—one of the prominently studied observations—and further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue, and Matthew Rabin. Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> outcomes {{in the near future}} more than for outcomes in the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1 when t is the near future, but high at time t when t is the present and time t+1 is the near future.|$|E
25|$|The {{recession}} hit many supermarkets {{as customers}} migrated <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> markets in even greater numbers. A was especially hard hit {{because of its}} increased debt load to complete the Pathmark purchase. In June 2010, A stopped paying $150 million in rent on the closed Farmer Jack stores. In August, A {{announced that it would}} close another 25 stores in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania: 13 Pathmarks, 6 A, 2 Waldbaum's, and 4 Super Fresh stores. In September, A announced it was selling seven Connecticut stores to Big Y. On December 10, 2010, bankruptcy rumors surfaced; A stock tumbled from over $3 per share to below $1 before trading was halted. Two days later, A announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York, A listed over $2.5 billion in assets, and $3.2 billion in debt.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is common}} for {{competing}} retailers to segment the market by choosing different pricing strategies. The segments consist of two different sets of customers with different buying patterns, both purchases and pre-purchase research. Price-vigilant consumers, {{often referred to as}} [...] "cherry pickers," [...] tend to be attracted <b>to</b> <b>discounts.</b> They are willing to do the research <b>to</b> learn about <b>discounts,</b> and they are also willing to stockpile products when discounts exist. These consumers are better reached by promotional pricing strategies. In contrast, [...] "expected price shoppers" [...] are unwilling to do as much pre-purchase research and less likely <b>to</b> stockpile <b>discounted</b> items.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{economies of}} scale are {{primarily}} a long-run phenomenon and are due either to reductions in the technical coefficients of production (technical economies=increasing productivity by improved organisation or methods of production) or <b>to</b> <b>discounts</b> resulting from larger size (pecuniary economies).|$|R
