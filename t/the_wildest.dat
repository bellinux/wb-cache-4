5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe <b>the</b> <b>wildest</b> moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>wildest</b> {{races in}} NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran {{into the side of}} his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>wildest</b> {{and largest}} ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team was an awful 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently Lagarias {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> semigroup, {{which is}} intimately {{connected to the}} 3 x+ 1 conjecture.

In this paper, we consider a generalization of <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> semigroup {{which leads to the}} statement of a Weak qx+ 1 Conjecture for q any prime. We prove our conjecture for q= 5 together with a result analogous to <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> Number Theorem. Next, we look at two other classes of variations of <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> semigroup and prove a general statement of the same type as <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> Number Theorem...|$|R

500|$|Despite being a bestseller, Pilgrim {{received}} little academic attention until {{more than five}} years after its publication. Early reviewers Charles Nicol and J. C. Peirce linked Dillard with the Transcendentalism movement, comparing her to Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. [...] Author and environmentalist Edward Abbey, known as the [...] "Thoreau of the American West", stated that Dillard was the [...] "true heir of the Master". [...] He wrote, [...] "she alone has been able to compose, successfully, in Thoreau's extravagant and transcendental manner." [...] In his 1992 book critic Scott Slovic wrote that Pilgrim at Tinker Creek eventually [...] "catapulted [...] to prominence among contemporary American nonfiction writers—particularly among nature writers—and stimulated a wealth of reviews and a steadily accumulating body of criticism." [...] Gary McIlroy believed that Dillard's work is distinctive for its [...] "vibrant rediscovery of the woods.

[...] By the time Raleigh had restored order, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds nearly, almost half the wealth of the English treasury at the time and perhaps the second-largest treasure ever after the Ransom of Atahualpa, had been reduced to £140,000. [...] Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure around the coast and up the River Thames to London.

[...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior."

Robinson similarly commended the gravity, saying that the different uses of the game's gravitational pulls allows the scale of to grow to [...] "genuinely draw-dropping proportions".
