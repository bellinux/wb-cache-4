50|$|<b>Tanning</b> <b>lamps,</b> {{also known}} as tanning bulbs or tanning tubes, produce the {{ultraviolet}} light in tanning devices. The performance (or output) varies widely between brands and styles. Most are low-pressure fluorescent tubes, but high-pressure bulbs also exist. The electronics systems and number of lamps affect performance, but {{to a lesser degree}} than the <b>lamp</b> itself. <b>Tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> are regulated separately from tanning beds in most countries, as they are the consumable portion of the system.|$|R
5000|$|Fluorescent <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> {{require an}} {{electrical}} ballast {{to limit the}} amount of current going through the lamp. While the resistance of an incandescent lamp filament inherently limits the current inside the <b>lamp,</b> <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> do not and instead have negative resistance. They are plasma devices, like a neon sign, and will pass as much current as the external circuit will provide, {{even to the point of}} self-destruction. [...] Thus a ballast is needed to regulate the current through them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{virtually}} maintenance free, {{but must be}} kept clean, as UV can easily be blocked by dust drawn in from the cooling system (or from improperly cleaned acrylics shields). Most manufacturers recommend wiping the lamps and other internals clean every 200 to 300 hours of operation. Most salons will replace their <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> once per year, while home tanning bed owners can expect 3 to 5 years of use. This depends solely {{on the number of}} hours the lamps have been used and the rated life of the lamp, which varies from model to model.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{introduction}} in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts {{have been}} used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} UV that is {{generated}} from a low-pressure lamp is {{highly dependent on}} {{the temperature in the}} tanning unit. As a rule, tanning lamps produce the highest amount of ultraviolet light when this temperature is between [...] As the temperature moves away from this range, the amount of UV produced is reduced. Cooling systems for tanning equipment are usually designed to maintain a range of temperature instead of providing maximum airflow for this reason. Higher temperatures will also reduce the expected life of the <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp.</b> This is why it is important to perform regular maintenance, including checking cooling fans and insuring that vent holes are not blocked. The owners manual for the tanning equipment is the best source for maintenance schedules and methods.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, Richard Küch {{discovered}} that evaporated quicksilver (mercury) in a quartz tube acted as an intense light source when stimulated with electricity. In {{light of this}} discovery, Heraeus joined forces with AEG and founded a quartz lamp company, culminating {{in the development of}} the ‘Original Hanau Synthetic Sunlamp’ which flooded onto the German market as early as the 1930s. By the 1950s, the <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp</b> had become a popular consumer electronics item. After buying out AEG in 1973, a number of newly developed products were added to the range. Heraeus Noblelight now supplies infrared and ultraviolet emitters as well as UV-LEDs to a variety of industries, for use in automotive production, printing, plastics and semiconductors, analytical instruments, laser and environmental technology in solariums, and water and air treatment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> (sometimes called <b>tanning</b> {{bulbs in}} the United States or tanning tubes in Europe) are {{the part of}} a tanning bed, booth or other tanning device which {{produces}} ultraviolet light responsible for tanning. There are hundreds of different kinds of <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> most of which can be classified in two basic groups: low pressure and high pressure. Within the industry, it is common to call high-pressure units [...] "bulbs" [...] and low-pressure units [...] "lamps", although there are many exceptions and not everyone follows this example. This is likely due {{to the size of the}} unit, rather than the type. Both types require an oxygen free environment inside the lamp.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{installed}} in a tanning bed, tanning booth, tanning canopy or free standing single bulb tanning unit. The quality of the tan (or how similar it is to a tan from the natural sun) depends upon the spectrum of the light that is generated from the lamps.|$|R

Scientific research has revealed a strong link between skin cancer and ultraviolet light exposure from indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps.</b> Despite such dangers, federal regulations place minimal {{restrictions on the}} labeling of indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps.</b> Indoor <b>tanning</b> salons work vigorously to dispel notions of a link to skin cancer, often falsely promoting various health benefits of indoor tanning. The first lawsuit for injuries resulting from indoor tanning was recently filed against an indoor tanning salon, and other such litigation is poised to follow. This Note examines three potential tort claims against indoor tanning manufacturers and salons, and suggests ways to formulate compelling arguments in each instance.

5000|$|Blue Hawaii was {{the first}} of three Elvis films to be shot in Hawaii, {{followed}} by Girls! Girls! Girls! in 1962 and Paradise, Hawaiian Style in 1965. Producer Hal B. Wallis was keen to put Presley into a film that showed how the army affected a man. Actress Juliet Prowse, who had starred with Presley in GI Blues, was approached to be his love interest again. However, after her demands were put forward, Paramount decided to drop her as a possible candidate for the role, choosing Joan Blackman instead. Presley was apparently so pale before shooting that Wallis personally recommended a brand of <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp</b> to darken his skin. The film was announced in the fall of 1960 as Hawaii Beach Boy. At the time, film producer Walter Mirisch had a similar titled film in production, [...] "Hawaii", and he was upset that Wallis had chosen such a similar name.|$|E

After Michaela {{makes fun of}} her pale complexion, Carmel decides to use Michaela's <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp.</b> However the lamp is faulty and it explodes in her face. Carmel is told she will have a permanent scar on her face. Carmel goes up to the hospital roof, intending to jump, as she believes she was only unique because of her appearance and has nothing to live for. Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) persuades Carmel not to jump. Carmel {{finds it hard to}} leave the hospital and Ally Gorman (Daniel O'Connor) introduces her to some of his army friends who have lost limbs. Still embarrassed over her scar, Carmel decides to stay with Nana (Diane Langton) for a few weeks. Carmel is romanced by Barney Harper-McBride (Tom Scurr). Carmel meets lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) and she is disgusted when he tries to flirt with her. Mercedes tells Carmel that Nana was paying Barney to romance her and Carmel is humiliated. She runs straight into the path of Jim's car and Jim helps Carmel home. After accidentally punching Jim, Carmel takes him to dinner, where he argues with Doctor Browning (Joseph Thompson). Carmel rebuffs Jim's advances. As Carmel cleans up the pond in place of Jacqui, she is upset to see a magazine article on her tanning accident. Jim asks Carmel out on a date and she accepts. When Carmel believes Jim has arranged a lunch at The Dog in the Pond and sees him eating a hotdog, she storms off, as she believed the date would be more fancy. She then sees a limousine and realises that it is part of Jim's plan. Jim decides to go off in the limousine himself, leaving Carmel feeling guilty.|$|E
40|$|Background Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that a <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp</b> emitting predominantly ultraviolet (UV) A induces significant yields of the type of potentially mutagenic DNA damage that are associated with the onset of skin cancer (i. e. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers). UV-induced immunosuppression is also an important event leading to skin cancer. Objectives To the modulation of key immunological molecules following exposure to a broad-spectrum UVB lamp and a predominantly UVA-emitting <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp</b> using model in vitro systems. Methods We compared secretion and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL) - 6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and interferon (IFN) -γ-induced intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 in normal human fibroblasts irradiated in vitro with a broad-spectrum UVB lamp or with a Philips 'Performance' <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp.</b> Results With broad-spectrum UVB irradiation, upregulation of IL- 6 and TNF-α mRNA was detected 6 h after irradiation, and a dose-dependent increase of cytokines in the supernatants of irradiated cells was found 24 h after irradiation. In contrast, there was no cytokine secretion and little evidence for mRNA upregulation following exposure to a <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp.</b> When cells were exposed first to broad-spectrum UVB, then the <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp,</b> UVB-induced cytokine secretion was inhibited, although mRNA levels were upregulated to a level close to that observed with UVB alone. By using a Schott WG 320 nm filter to attenuate the level of UVB relative to UVA emitted by the <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp,</b> the inhibition of cytokine secretion was shown to be associated with UVA exposure. Both UV sources inhibited IFN-γ-induced ICAM- 1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion. By using a Schott WG 335 nm filter, inhibition of ICAM- 1 mRNA expression by the <b>tanning</b> <b>lamp</b> was shown to be associated with UVB exposure. Conclusions These results suggest that UV sources emitting different levels of UVA and UVB have differential effects on the modulation of different immunoregulatory molecules, and indicate that there are potential interactions between these wavelengths...|$|E
50|$|A {{tan line}} is a {{visually}} clear division on the human skin between an area of pronounced comparative paleness relative to other areas that have been suntanned by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The source of the radiation may be the sun, or artificial UV sources such as <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps.</b> <b>Tan</b> lines are usually an inadvertent result of a work environment or of recreational activities, but are sometimes intentional. Many people regard visible tan lines as un-aesthetic, and seek to avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn.|$|R
50|$|Suntans, which {{naturally}} {{develop in}} some individuals as a protective mechanism against the sun, are viewed by {{most in the}} Western world as desirable. This {{has led to an}} overall increase in exposure to UV radiation from both the natural sun and <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps.</b> Suntans can provide a modest sun protection factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to three times the UV exposure as pale skin.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{confusing}} aspects of <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> in North America, as lamps in the US are not rated for their total output, but rather their ratio of UVA to UVB. Most people could be led to believe that a 6.5% lamp is stronger than a 5% lamp, while both lamps might have the same total UV output (or the 5% could even be stronger across the spectrum).|$|R
5000|$|The 100 watt {{version of}} a {{reflector}} lamp is typically called a RUVA (Reflector UVA) or less commonly HO-R (High Output - Reflector).

30|$|Of the total, 302 Caucasian female {{responses}} {{were included in}} the analyses. A female college student group is an appropriate sample to examine the relationships among body image, body dissatisfaction, and attitudes toward sunless tanning product use. In response to the high preference of tanning among young female adults (Gillen and Markey 2012), a female college student sample has been often selected in several studies on tanning behavior. In addition, the Caucasian ethnic group has been selected because they are the primary users of artificial tanning facilities (Demko et al. 2003; Gillen and Markey 2012; Guy et al. 2011). Ages ranged from 18 to 31  years, with an average age of 20.11  years old. The youngest age at which participants used a tanning bed or booth with <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> was 12  years old, and the oldest age was 28  years old. Over half of the participants have used sunless tanning creams or lotions that they applied themselves (56.8 %), and over half of them have never used a tanning bed or booth with <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> (72.4 %), nor have they ever used a spray-on or mist tan at a tanning salon or other business (69.4 %).|$|R
50|$|The TE isn't {{generally}} published, {{although it}} is usually available from the lamp manufacturer on request. Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) biases tests against UVB, the TE may make a weaker lamp appear stronger by having more UVB. Furthermore, although tanning beds are rated with exposure times, <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> are not because beds can vary widely as to how a given lamp affects the user, making it difficult or impossible to compare the total UV output of different low-pressure lamps.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{fluorescent}} <b>lamps,</b> low-pressure <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> have a ballast {{to start}} the lamps and limit the flow of current. The plasma of excited mercury atoms inside the lamp emits ultraviolet light directly. The lamps are coated on the inside with special phosphors. Unlike high-pressure lamps, the glass that is used in low-pressure lamps filters out all UVC. Once the plasma is fully formed, the plasma strips away the outer electrons from the mercury; when these electrons return to a lower energy level, visible and ultraviolet light is emitted. Some of the short-wave ultraviolet excites the phosphors, which then emits photons in the proper spectrum for tanning.|$|R
2500|$|Ultraviolet [...] (UV) is an {{electromagnetic}} radiation with a wavelength from 10nm [...] to 400nm, shorter {{than that of}} visible light but longer than X-rays. UV radiation constitutes about 10% of the total light output of the Sun, and is thus present in sunlight. It is also produced by electric arcs and specialized lights, such as mercury-vapor <b>lamps,</b> <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps,</b> and black lights. Although it's not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.|$|R
50|$|Sunburn {{is caused}} by UV radiation, either from the sun or from {{artificial}} sources, such as <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps,</b> welding arcs, or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. It is a reaction {{of the body to}} direct DNA damage from UVB light. This damage is mainly the formation of a thymine dimer. The damage is recognized by the body, which then triggers several defense mechanisms, including DNA repair to revert the damage, apoptosis and peeling to remove irreparably damaged skin cells, and increased melanin production to prevent future damage. Melanin readily absorbs UV wavelength light, acting as a photoprotectant. By preventing UV photons from disrupting chemical bonds, melanin inhibits both the direct alteration of DNA and the generation of free radicals, thus indirect DNA damage.|$|R
40|$|The cornea is {{sensitive}} {{to the effects of}} ultraviolet (UV) light and can suffer both acute and chronic toxicity. Ultraviolet keratitis is associated with relatively short exposures to light sources such as welding arcs or <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps.</b> The corneal effects are seen within a few hours following exposure and typically will resolve within 72 hours. Chronic exposure to environmental UV light may lead to a variety of ocular surface abnormalities that rarely resolve in the absence of therapy. Ultraviolet light, while potentially destructive, also can be used therapeutically. Recently, the photoablative properties of the excimer laser have been used in corneal refractive surgery. This laser uses UV light to break chemical bonds and remove tissue. Corneal phototoxicity {{is a reflection of the}} sensitivity of the ocular surface to photochemical injury. Fortunately, effective protection in the form of UV-blocking lenses is widely available...|$|R
5000|$|All {{fluorescent}} lamps contain mercury, {{and at this}} time, no suitable replacement has been found. Many US states have banned disposal of lamps containing mercury, and have established regulations requiring that lamps containing mercury are identified as such. This has not caused problems for manufacturers, however, as lamps are not produced locally, and often not in the US. There have been several efforts to label all lamps that contain mercury with a universally accepted symbol, Hg. [...] Old lamps should be handled as would be any hazardous material in your locality, and persons should take special precautions when dealing with broken lamps to avoid contact with mercury. This is particularly true for pregnant women. [...] These laws and guidelines are not unique to <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps,</b> and apply to all {{fluorescent lamps}}, other lamps that contain mercury, {{as well as other}} products that contain mercury with the exception of pharmaceuticals. Proper disposal or recycling will prevent the small mercury content of the lamps from entering the environment.|$|R
2500|$|A {{black light}} lamp emits long-wave UVA {{radiation}} and little visible light. Fluorescent {{black light lamp}}s work similarly to other fluorescent lamps, but use a phosphor on the inner tube surface which emits UVA radiation instead of visible light. Some lamps use a deep-bluish-purple Wood's glass optical filter that blocks almost all visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nanometres. Others use plain glass instead of the more expensive Wood's glass, so they appear light-blue to the eye when operating. A black light may also be formed, very inefficiently, by using a layer of Wood's glass in the envelope for an incandescent bulb. Though cheaper than fluorescent UV lamps, only 0.1% of the input power is emitted as usable ultraviolet radiation. Mercury-vapor black lights in ratings up to 1kW with UV-emitting phosphor and an envelope of Wood's glass are used for theatrical and concert displays. Black lights are used in applications in which extraneous visible light must be minimized; mainly to observe fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances give off when exposed to UV light. [...] UVA/UVB emitting bulbs are also sold for other special purposes, such as <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> and reptile-keeping.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Ultraviolet (UV) {{irradiation}} exposure {{represents a}} significant environmental and occupational hazard {{that can cause}} acute and chronic inflammatory changes in the exposed cornea. Acute exposure to solar UV irradiation or to UV irradiation from such artificial sources as <b>tanning</b> <b>lamps</b> can result in severe pain and inflammation in the cornea. Chronic exposure to solar UV irradiation is associated with several external eye diseases including pterygium and squamous metaplasia or carcinoma. In the skin, inflammatory responses to UV exposure appear to be mediated by the release of inflammatory cytokines. The role of corneal-derived cytokines in UV-mediated corneal inflammation has not been established. In this study, the effect of UV exposure on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by corneal cells was examined. Methods. Cultured human corneal stroma cells and whole human corneas received UV irradiation (10 to 100 mj/cm 2), {{and the production of}} the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -l, IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) was measured by Northern blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cytokine bioassays, and immunohistochemical analysis.
