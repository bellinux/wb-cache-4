5|$|On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) F-13 Superfortress {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942. <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> reconnaissance sortie was highly successful, with the aircraft's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids on Japan during the final months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude it operated at.|$|E

25|$|Replacing the 1971 promotional {{image for}} Raga, which showed a {{silhouette}} of a cow {{against a backdrop of}} a sunset, the new cover consisted of a still of Shankar playing sitar during the 1960s. <b>This</b> <b>photo,</b> taken by Canadian portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh, shows a portion of the seven-played-string model of sitar that Shankar had popularised over the more traditional six-string model favoured by musicians such as Vilayat Khan.|$|E
25|$|Mallory's {{daughter}} said that Mallory carried {{a photograph of}} his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including documents in his wallet, this points to the possibility that he may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported seeing any evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|E

25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and clutched what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Prokudin-Gorsky's best-known {{work during}} his {{lifetime}} was his color portrait of Leo Tolstoy, which was reproduced in various publications, on postcards, and as larger prints for framing. The fame from <b>this</b> <b>photo</b> and his earlier photos of Russia's nature and monuments earned him invitations to show his work to the Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1908, and to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909. The Tsar enjoyed the demonstration, and, with his blessing, Prokudin-Gorsky got the permission and funding to document Russia in color. In the course of ten years, he {{was to make a}} collection of 10,000 photos. Prokudin-Gorsky considered the project his life's work and continued his photographic journeys through Russia until after the October Revolution. He was appointed to a new professorship under the new regime, but he left the country in August 1918. He still pursued scientific work in color photography, published papers in English photography journals and, together with his colleague S.O. Maksimovich, obtained patents in Germany, England, France and Italy.|$|E

500|$|On April 10, 1927, Wright hiked with Adams, Virginia Best, Charles Michael {{and another}} photographer, Arnold Williams, to a rocky perch high above Yosemite Valley called the [...] "Diving Board". There, Adams took Monolith, the Face of Half Dome, which Mary Street Alinder called Adams's [...] "most {{significant}} photograph" [...] {{because it was}} a triumph of visualization showing [...] "extreme manipulation of tonal values". <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> set Adams on the path of becoming America's most well-known photographer. [...] Adams called the excursion a [...] "personally historic moment in my photographic career." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{she saw the}} Smithsonian cover {{image in}} 1994, Geraldine Hoff Doyle {{said that she was}} the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been {{captured}} in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that <b>this</b> <b>photo</b> inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as [...] "Rosie the Riveter", Doyle was honored by many organizations including the Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as 20-year-old Naomi Parker, working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated from high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so first Doyle and then Parker cannot be confirmed as the model for [...] "We Can Do It!" ...|$|E
500|$|Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as {{a concept}} album on which the material–spiritual [...] "quandary" [...] evident in the title track is [...] "eloquently expressed" [...] through the artwork's mix of {{religious}} symbolism and an inner-gatefold photograph that showed [...] " [...] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast". The stretch-limousine image was a detail taken from <b>this</b> <b>photo,</b> the concept for which reflected Harrison's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions, but to [...] "everything which is gross, physical, or material {{as opposed to the}} subtle, astral or casual", as he puts it in I, Me, Mine when discussing the song. NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing [...] "Harrison with his musicians (Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner, Ringo – the usual lot) enjoying a hearty repast, passing the no-doubt vintage wine, while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience".|$|E

500|$|In 1941, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes hired Adams for {{six months}} to create {{photographs}} of lands {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Department of the Interior. Wright accompanied Adams and his young son Michael Adams on a long road trip around the west. While traveling through the Chama River valley near nightfall on November 1, 1941, they encountered a [...] "fantastic scene", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to [...] "Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!" [...] Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. The result was Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, a photograph that became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. [...] On October 17, 2006, Sotheby's auctioned a print of this photograph for $609,600. [...] Art historian H. W. Janson called <b>this</b> <b>photo</b> [...] "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".|$|E
500|$|At Harrison's urging, Capitol Records, Apple's {{distributor}} in the United States, set {{all four}} of its manufacturing plants to producing copies of the [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] single; one-sided, white label promo discs were also rushed through to ensure immediate radio play for the song. For the US picture sleeve, designer Tom Wilkes chose a suitably topical image, incorporating headlines and text from New York Times articles about the Bangladesh crisis. The articles made mention of vultures being the [...] "happiest creatures" [...] amid the chaos in Dacca, and India's [...] "wait and see" [...] policy regarding events in East Pakistan. The front of the picture sleeve was topped with the line [...] "(We've Got to Relieve)" [...] before the words [...] "Bangla Desh", leading a number of publications to include the parenthetical text {{as part of the}} official song title. Boxed off {{at the foot of the}} front sleeve were details of the George Harrison–Ravi Shankar Special Emergency Relief Fund (care of UNICEF's New York headquarters), to which proceeds of the single would go and further donations were encouraged. The back cover of the US sleeve was taken from a UPI news agency photograph – an [...] "emotional" [...] image showing a mother comforting her starving child. <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> was also used in the aid project's magazine advertising campaign, as well as for the front of the single's picture sleeve in Denmark and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Betty is {{last seen}} in May 2011, trying {{in vain to}} stop David (Jack P. Shepherd) and Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) from coming behind the bar to speak with Becky. Although Betty is {{mentioned}} and referred to by various characters since, her subsequent absence was not explained until in February 2012, when Audrey asks Stella Price (Michelle Collins) how Betty is, to which Stella replies that Betty is [...] "still a bit under the weather". On 16 April 2012 Rita and Emily arrange to visit a convalescing Betty and go to meet Gordon, who has agreed to drive them there. However, when Gordon does arrive, he brings with him the unexpected news that Betty has died, peacefully in her sleep the night before. The residents of the street all gather in the Rovers Return and hold an impromptu memorial to Betty, with all of her old friends reminiscing about her. Gordon, with some persuasion from Emily decides to have his mother buried in Weatherfield after initially contemplating London. It is later revealed that Annie Walker left The Rovers Return to Betty in her will however Betty never acted on this, Gordon assured landlady Stella Price {{that he is not}} interested in the pub and it will remain in her possession. Despite being one of the street's longest serving characters, her funeral was held off-screen. After the wake and lock-up, Stella hung a photo of Betty on the wall over The Rovers Return, for all to see and remember her. <b>This</b> <b>photo</b> was sadly destroyed during the 2013 Rovers Return fire, started by Karl Munro but, following the refurbishment, Rita managed to obtain an identical copy which remains hanging on the wall in the same place.|$|E
