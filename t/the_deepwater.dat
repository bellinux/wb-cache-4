5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex {{passes through}} the area {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon oil spill, causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash onshore portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Following the April 2010 {{destruction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon while drilling the Macondo well, {{and the resulting}} oil spill, all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might otherwise {{have been used for}} developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E

5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In a 1990 {{morphological}} phylogenetic study, Kiyonori Nishida {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> <b>deepwater</b> stingray and the sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon bickelli) {{were the most}} basal stingrays (suborder Myliobatoidei). Therefore, he moved this species to its own genus, Plesiobatis, and family, Plesiobatidae; the name {{is derived from the}} Greek plesio ("primitive") and batis ("ray"). Subsequent morphological studies have corroborated the basal position of Plesiobatis, but disagreed on its relationships to nearby taxa. John McEachran, Katherine Dunn, and Tsutomu Miyake in 1996 could not fully resolve the position of Plesiobatis, thus they assigned it provisionally to the family Hexatrygonidae. McEachran and Neil Aschliman in 2004 found Plesiobatis to be the sister taxon of Urolophus, and recommended that it be placed in the family Urolophidae. Until the phylogeny is better-resolved, authors have tended to preserve the family Plesiobatidae.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deepwater</b> {{stingray}} has a flabby body, with enlarged pectoral fins {{forming a}} disc usually {{longer than it}} is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. The snout is thin and measures over six times {{as long as the}} diameter of the orbit; the snout tip protrudes slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32–60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Five was an Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone {{that lasted for}} 12hours, although its remnants persisted for almost another week. Its precursor was from a non-tropical trough east of Florida, and on August10 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was declassified as a {{tropical cyclone}} the following day, a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi, producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding. Along the Florida coast, the system produced heavy waves that contributed to two deaths. Moving inland, {{the remnants of the}} depression reached central Alabama before turning southward. The system nearly redeveloped into a tropical cyclone on August16 after it again reached the Gulf of Mexico, but it became disorganized and turned northward into Mississippi. The depression twice caused BP to delay work in building a relief well to combat <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon oil spill.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in <b>the</b> <b>deepwater</b> channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E
25|$|In West Virginia, the owners, surveyors, and {{builders}} of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Railway ran into lots of conflicts {{with both the}} C and the N There was a nasty dispute with C forces over a contested tunnel site near Jenny Gap which landed in court. The Raleigh County court ruled for the C, but the West Virginia Supreme Court reversed the ruling in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Railway. In another court case, Page had {{what may have been}} a near-miss with a perjury charge. Upon interrogation by N attorneys in a West Virginia legal confrontation over right-of-way, Col. Page representing <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Railway, identified the estate of the late Abram S. Hewitt, a former mayor of New York as one of his investors. Page never mentioned Rogers, who it is now known had been an associate of Hewitt and may have been acting through the Hewitt estate. The N attorneys were unsuccessful in learning more at that time, or during many other confrontations as they attempted to stop the progress of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> in West Virginia. Ultimately, both the C and the N lost the battle and <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> routing was successfully secured east to the Virginia state line near Glen Lyn.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, the United States Department of the Interior {{called for}} an end to {{drilling}} in the area of <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon spill.

BP agreed to financial compensation for the damage they caused, including payouts to <b>the</b> <b>Deepwater</b> Horizon Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced.|$|E
