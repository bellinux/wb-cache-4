50|$|Rheostatic braking {{was used}} on the trains, and {{required}} amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which friction brakes on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic braking fades as the speed drops below 10 mph, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each bogie were wired in series permanently, and the <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.|$|E

A fuzzy logic approach is appealing for traction control because of the non-linearities and time-varying uncertainties in traction control systems.

The other fuzzy logic controller regulates wheel slip at any desired value. The controllers' performance and robustness against changing road conditions and time- varying uncertainty is evaluated by simulation.

40|$|In {{the world}} of DC railway trains nowadays, asynchronous-traction machine with <b>traction</b> <b>controllers,</b> i. e. an {{inverter}} with variable output frequency, is implemented. This controller changes the incoming DC voltage into an AC voltage of a variable frequency and RMS amplitude. The disadvantages of switching inverters, compared to a pure sine wave source, are the harmonics they inject in both the output as in the input of the inverters connection. At the incoming power line, {{it is necessary to}} damp these harmonics, in order to avoid resonance issues or issues regarding other systems, for instance, train detection. For this purpose of harmonic and transient filtering, generated within as well as outside the train, an LC filter is utilised. However, this LC-filter has also influence on stability. Due to the resulting impedance to current variation in the inductance of the LC-filter, the power flow dynamics towards the train are decreased. When applying a certain amount of power, the voltage over the capacitance can become unstable very quickly. In this thesis, a graphical user interface simulation model is made to simulate these stability phenomena in Simulink in order to find the optimum size of the LC-filter in a train on the Dutch DC railway. The simulations are achieved with a model representing a generalised train. The model is simple to modify, and consists of the important parts for determining the stability of the system. Different simulations have been carried out, in order to examine the effect certain parameter variations have on the stability. Two systems have been considered, a constant power controlled system and a system where the motors had no controlling regime. An important factor is the value of the capacitance and inductance. A larger filter inductor results in an unstable system. Likewise, implementing a higher value capacitance will cause the system to be more stable. Simulations have shown that a motor controller with a simple constant power control regime is unstable with normal values for the inductance and capacitance. However a damping branch can solve this problem up to an extent. A system without any controlling regime has proven to be more stable with smaller capacitance. By utilising the model presented in this thesis, the stability of the system, consisting purely of a controlled constant power load or as a non-controlled load, can be investigated, and the impact of the LC-filter can be determined.

40|$|The most {{electric}} {{trains in}} DC-electrified railways are presently equipped with regenerative braking system.

Therefore, the <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> of the braking train must reduce the electrical power following squeezing control of regenerative power when the electrical loads are too little in the electrical circuit because there is typically no devices which absorb the regenerated energy in the electrical circuit.

Many studies have been conducted in this field and researchers have used different tools and have proposed different algorithms. This literature survey introduces different approaches, which have been widely used to estimate the friction or other related parameters, and covers the recent literature that contains these methodologies. The emphasize of this review paper is on the algorithms and studies, which are more popular and have been repeated several times. The focus has been divided into two main groups: experiment-based and model-based approaches. Each of these main groups has several sub-categories, which are explained in the next few sections.

40|$|In recent years, {{electrification}} of powertrain {{has gradually}} become {{the core of}} research and development efforts in automotive industry. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} electrified powertrains can effectively alleviate concerns of environmental pollution caused by internal combustion engines (ICEs) and reduce the rate of depletion of the earth's natural resources, while offering a higher efficiency and a better fuel economy. One of the key components of every electric vehicle (EV) /hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is the Energy Storage System (ESS). An ESS provides propulsion power to the electric drivetrain and captures regenerative braking power. Batteries and ultracapacitors are the most well-known ESS devices for automotive applications. In battery/ultracapacitor-based powertrains, the storage units are configured as series-parallel arrangements of individual cells. In this thesis, the battery and ultracapacitor units are assumed to be composed of parallel branches of series-connected cells. Optimal sizing of the storage unit (determining the optimum numbers of the parallel branches and series-connected cells) and the interfacing infrastructure (if any DC-DC converter exists between the storage unit(s) and the <b>traction</b> motor <b>controller)</b> can have a significant impact on the manufacturing cost of the electric vehicle and its fuel economy. This thesis formulates the problem of optimal sizing of battery/ultracapacitor-based energy storage systems in electric vehicles. Through the course of this research, a flexible optimization platform has been developed. When solving the optimization problem, different constraints such as limits on state of charge, current, and power of the battery cells, current and power of the ultracapacitor cells, voltage conversion of the DC-DC converter, DC bus voltage, and operation characteristics of the inverter and the traction motor are taken into account. This optimization tool is used to solve the problem of optimal sizing of the storage systems for two different classes of vehicles: (i) a small-size, long-range car and (ii) a city bus. Aside from optimal sizing of the storage systems as the main objective, the developed platform provides a proper simulation tool for analyzing the performance of existing electric vehicles on the road...|$|R
30|$|A {{new method}} {{used to detect}} the slip {{velocity}} {{is based on the}} multi-rate EKF state identification which combines the multi-rate and EKF method to estimate the traction motor load torque. This method provides a faster detection of slip and improves the reliability and traction performance [9]. A re-adhesion control system based on the disturbance observer for examining the first resonant frequency of the bogie system to utilize adhesion more efficiently was also proposed in [10, 11]. However, these methods are not reliable enough for industrial real-time applications because the time derivative of the adhesion force cannot be estimated correctly when the adhesion force changes quickly in case of sudden slip [12]. Estimation accuracy of adhesion force among the wheel and rail is quite beneficial for the solution of slip/slide problem. The aim of the controller is to maximize the adhesion coefficient while sustaining the overall stability of the railway vehicle. The slip velocity is adjusted by keeping it in the stable region adjacent to the peak point of the adhesion coefficient. To achieve the sub-optimal slip velocity, which corresponds to the approximity of the maximum value of the adhesion coefficient, is also suitable for the controller performance. The relationship between the tractive force and the wheel slip is a nonlinear function of the wheel–rail contact condition. For this reason, an estimator that estimates the wheel–rail adhesion condition and a <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> which adjusts the wheel slip velocity to the optimal value should be added to the control scheme. Several control methods have been proposed based on sliding mode controller, fuzzy logic, adaptive schemes in the literature [13, 14, 15].|$|E
40|$|Development of {{electric}} vehicles {{is motivated by}} global concerns over the need for environmental protection. In addition to its zero-emission characteristics, an electric propulsion system enables high performance torque control {{that may be used}} to maximize vehicle performance obtained from energy-efficient, low rolling resistance tires typically associated with degraded road-holding ability. A simultaneous plant/controller optimization is performed on an electric vehicle traction control system with respect to conflicting energy use and performance objectives. Due to system nonlinearities, an iterative simulation-based optimization approach is proposed using a system model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to guide search space exploration. The system model consists of: a drive cycle with a constant driver torque request and a step change in coefficient of friction, a single-wheel longitudinal vehicle model, a tire model described using the Magic Formula and a constant rolling resistance, and an adhesion gradient fuzzy logic <b>traction</b> <b>controller.</b> Optimization is defined in terms of the all at once variable selection of: either a performance oriented or low rolling resistance tire, the shape of a fuzzy logic controller membership function, and a set of fuzzy logic controller rule base conclusions. A mixed encoding, multi-chromosomal GA is implemented to represent the variables, respectively, as a binary string, a real-valued number, and a novel rule base encoding based on the definition of a partially ordered set (poset) by delta inclusion. Simultaneous optimization results indicate that, under straight-line acceleration and unless energy concerns are completely neglected, low rolling resistance tires should be incorporated in a traction control system design since the energy saving benefits outweigh the associated degradation in road-holding ability. The results also indicate that the proposed novel encoding enables the efficient representation of a fix-sized fuzzy logic rule base within a GA...|$|E
40|$|Advances in Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) have {{improved}} mobility {{for people with}} disabilities as well as older adults, and have enhanced their integration into society. Some of the issues still present in EPW lie in the difficulties when encountering different types of terrain, and access to higher or low surfaces. To this end, an advanced real-time electrical powered wheelchair controller was developed. The controller was comprised of a hardware platform with sensors measuring the speed of the driving, caster wheels and the acceleration, with a single board computer for implementing the control algorithms in real-time, a multi-layer software architecture, and modular design. A model based real-time speed and <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> was developed and validated by simulation. The controller was then evaluated via driving over four different surfaces at three specified speeds. Experimental results showed that model based control performed best on all surfaces across the speeds compared to PID (proportional-integral-derivative) and Open Loop control. A real-time slip detection and traction control algorithm was further developed and evaluated by driving the EPW over five different surfaces at three speeds. Results showed that the performance of anti-slip control was consistent on the varying surfaces at different speeds. The controller was also tested on a front wheel drive EPW to evaluate a forwarding tipping detection and prevention algorithm. Experimental results showed that the tipping could be accurately detected as it was happening and the performance of the tipping prevention strategy was consistent on the slope across different speeds. A terrain-dependent EPW user assistance system was developed based on the controller. Driving rules for wet tile, gravel, slopes and grass were developed and validated by 10 people without physical disabilities. The controller was also adapted to the Personal Mobility and Manipulation Appliance (PerMMA) Generation II, which is an advanced power wheelchair with a flexible mobile base, allowing it to adjust the positions of each of the four casters and two driving wheels.

40|$|Modern {{traction}} control techniques manage driven wheel speed from data obtained {{through a small}} number of sensors from around an automobile. This data is then fed into an onboard computer that has been specially programmed to attempt to maximise driven wheel traction from its information base. Problems can arise, however, when abnormal conditions are encountered. The small number of sensors used as controller inputs and the various assumptions made during the conventional controller programming can lead to erroneous correction commands — with an increased risk of spinout and other undesirable situations. The incorporation of artificial neural networks into the <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> command logic has the scope to bring a two-fold advantage. The first stems from a neural network's ability to learn. It can be programmed through experimental data, and thus removes the need for tedious mathematics programming of the vehicle dynamics, which can be used to reduce controller cost and also brings about the possibility of continual reprogramming as the vehicle's condition alters due to wear, etc. The second is its ability to cope with data from a large number of sensors. With more sensors in place, the NN has a large base of information on which to make decisions on how to optimise traction. The result, hopefully, will be a {{traction control}} response that will provide superior traction solutions and be readily programmed to suit different applications. This study aims at conducting preliminary research into the accuracy and application limitations of artificial neural networks in the interests of determining their feasibility for use in closed loop traction control applications. This includes selecting parameters to be predicted, as well as model input variables, network architectures and the collection of network training data for off-line control. To this end the accuracy of backpropagation and general regression neural networks will be compared using 14 input, single output architectures in the interests of predicting longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration and yaw angle, which are identified as crucial factors in vehicle dynamics control. The study also includes the complete construction of a test vehicle, in which the sensors are mounted and data acquisition systems used to gather the network training and testing data, from which this investigation is based.

40|$|Automotive {{development}} {{has always been}} need-based and the product of today is an evolutionover several decades and a diversied technology application to deliver better products to theend users. Steady increase in the deployment of on-board electronics and software is characterizedby the demand and stringent regulations. Today, almost every function on-board a modernvehicle is either monitored or controlled electronically. One such specic demand for AB Volvo arose out of construction trucks in the US market. Usersseldom have/had {{a view of the}} operational boundaries of the drivetrain components, resultingin inappropriate use causing damage, poor traction and steering performance. Also, AB Volvo'sstand-alone traction assistance functions were not suciently capable to handle the vehicle useconditions. Hence, the goal was set to automate and synchronize the traction assistance devicesand software functions to improve the traction and steerability under a variety of road conditions. The rst steps in this thesis involved understanding the drivetrain components from design andoperational boundary perspective. The function descriptions of the various traction softwarefunctions were reviewed and a development/integration plan drafted. A literature survey wascarried out seeking potential improvement in traction from dierential locking and also its eectson steerability. A benchmarking exercise was carried out to identify competitor and suppliertechnologies available for the traction device automation task. The focus was then shifted to developing and validating the <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> in a simulationenvironment. Importance was given to modeling of drivetrain components and renement ofvehicle behavior to study and understand the eects of dierential locking and develop a differentiallock control strategy. The modeling also included creating dierent road segments toreplicate use environment and simulating vehicle performance in the same, to reduce test timeand costs. With well-correlated vehicle performance results, a dierential lock control strategywas developed and simulated to observe traction improvement. It was then implemented onan all-wheel drive construction truck using dSPACE Autobox to test, validate and rene thecontroller. Periodic test sessions carried out at Hallered proving ground, Sweden were important to re-ne the control strategy. Feedback from test drivers and inputs from cross-functional teamswere essential to develop a robust controller and the same was tested for vehicle suitability andrepeatability of results. When comparing with the existing traction software functions, the integrateddierential lock and transfer case lock controller showed signicantly better performanceunder most test conditions. Repeatable results proved the reliability of developed controller. The correlation between vehicle test scenarios and simulation environment results indicated theaccuracy of software models and control strategy, bi-directionally. Finally, the new traction assistance device controller function was demonstrated within ABVolvo to showcase the traction improvement and uncompromising steerability...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} to reduce climate related emissions {{is driving the}} electrication of transportation. As well as reducing emissions Electric Vehicles (EV) have the capability of improving traction and vehicle stability. Unlike a conventional vehicle that uses a single Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to drive one or both axles, an EV can have an electric machine driving each of the wheels independently. This opens up {{the possibility of using}} the electric machines as an actuator for traction control. In conventional vehicles the hydraulic brakes together with the ICE are used to actuate traction control. The advantages of electric machines over hydraulic brakes are precise measurable torque, higher bandwidth, bidirectional torque and kinetic energy recovery. A review of the literature shows that a wide range of control methods is used for traction control of EVs. These are mainly focused on control of an individual wheel, with only a minority being advanced to the experimental stage of verication. Integrated approaches to the control of multiple wheels are generally lacking, as well as verication that tests the vehicle's directional stability. A large body of the literature uses the slip ratio of the wheel as the key control variable. A signicant challenge for slip-based traction control is the detection of vehicle velocity together with the calculation of slip around zero vehicle velocity. A traction control method that does not depend upon vehicle velocity detection or slip ratio is Maximum Transmissible Torque Estimation (MTTE), after Yin et al. (2009). In this thesis an MTTE based method is developed for a full size electric vehicle with independently driven rear wheels. The original MTTE method for a single wheel is analysed using a simple quarter vehicle model. The simulation results of Yin et al. (2009) are in general reproducible although a lack of data in the original research prevents a quantitative comparison. A modication is proposed to the rate compensation term. Simulation results show that the proposed modication ensures that the torque demand is delivered to the wheel under normal driving conditions, this includes negative torque demand which is not possible for MTTE, Yin et al. (2009). Enabling negative torque demands means that the proposed traction control is compatible with higher level stability control such as torque vectoring. The performance of the controller is veried through a combination of simulation and vehicle based experiments. Compared with experiments, simulations are fast and inexpensive and can provide greater insight as all of the variables are observable. To simulate the controller a high delity vehicle model is required. To achieve this it is necessary to initially validate the model against experimental data. Simulation verication using a validated vehicle model is lacking in the literature. A full vehicle model is developed for this thesis using Dymola, a multi-body system software tool. The model includes the full suspension geometry of the vehicle. Pacejka's "Magic Formula" is used for the tyre model. The model is validated using Delta Motorsport's E 4 coupe. The two Wheel Independent Drive (2 WID) MTTE-based <b>traction</b> <b>controller</b> is derived from the equations of motion for the vehicle. This shows that the maximum transmissible torque for one driven wheel is dependent on the friction force of both driven wheels, which has not been shown before. An equal torque strategy is proposed to maintain vehicle directional stability on mixed-μ roads. For verication the 2 WID-MTTE controller is simulated on the validated vehicle model described above. The proposed 2 WID-MTTE controller is benchmarked against a similar method without the equal torque strategy, termed Independent MTTE, as well as a method combining Direct Yaw Control (DYC) and Independent MTTE. The three controllers are simulated for a vehicle accelerating onto a split-μ road. The results show that the proposed 2 WID-MTTE controller prevents the vehicle spinning o the road when compared to Independent MTTE. 2 WID-MTTE is found to be as eective as DYC+Independent MTTE but is simpler in design and requires fewer sensors. The proposed 2 WID-MTTE controller is also simulated for a vehicle accelerating from a low- to high-μ road. This is done to assess the controller's ability to return to normal operation after a traction event, and because there are no simulations of this type for MTTE control on a high delity vehicle model in the literature. The results show that oscillations in the tyre-road friction force as the wheel transitions across the change in μ somewhat impede the return of the controller's output torque to the torque demand. The 2 WID-MTTE controller is implemented on Delta Motorsport's E 4 coupe by integrating it into the vehicle's Powertrain Control Module (PCM). This is experimentally tested for the vehicle accelerating across a range of surfaces at the MIRA proving ground. The experimental tests include high- to low-μ, low- to high-μ and split-μ roads. The results for the high- to low-μ road tests show that 2 WID-MTTE control prevents the vehicle spinning when compared to no control. Similar to the simulation, the results of the low- to high-μ road experiment show that the controller output torque is also impeded from returning to the demand torque. Observation of the estimated friction force together with the on-board accelerometers conrm that this is due to tyre friction oscillating after the transition. This justies the use of a tyre model with transient dynamics. The proposed 2 WID-MTTE controller uses wheel velocity and torque feedback to estimate friction torque. These signals are obtained from the vehicle's motor controllers via a Controlled Area Network (CAN) bus. The 2 WID-MTTE controller is benchmarked against Independent MTTE that uses wheel velocity measured directly from the wheel hub sensors and the torque demand to estimate friction torque. The results show that the delays introduced by the CAN bus increase wheel slip for the 2 WID-MTTE controller. However, the equal torque strategy means that 2 WID-MTTE controller maintains greater vehicle directional stability, which {{is more important than the}} pursuit of greater acceleration. </p...|$|E
