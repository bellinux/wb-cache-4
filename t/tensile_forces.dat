5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

Ductility is especially important in metalworking because materials that crack or break under stress cannot be hammered, rolled, or drawn (drawing {{is a process that}} uses <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> to stretch metal).|$|E
25|$|In {{steel plate}} construction, {{stringers}} join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced concrete construction by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel {{is on the}} outside, where <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> are often greatest.|$|E

40|$|In a chain canveyor system, <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> {{and chain}} slack have a {{significant}} effect on a material's vibration and transferring efficiency. Therefore it becomes an important problem for the chain conveyor to control <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> and chain slack, Nowadays, most chain conveyor drive sprockets are driven by a motor, and the driven sprocket is controlled by a brake to give a moderate <b>tensile</b> <b>force.</b> However, it is difficult to adequately control the <b>tensile</b> <b>force,</b> because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> and chain slack without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor. In this report, we describe the performance of this system...|$|R

2500|$|Long {{periods of}} {{weightlessness}} occur on spacecraft outside a planet's atmosphere, provided no propulsion is applied and {{the vehicle is}} not rotating. Weightlessness does not occur when a spacecraft is firing its engines or when re-entering the atmosphere, even if the resultant acceleration is constant.

2500|$|Prestressing {{concrete}} is {{a technique}} that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force. [...] Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{variation}} of <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> during the start, stop {{and operation of}} belt conveyor, a tension technology and equipment of high accuracy and large tensioning stroke has been developed. It can quickly respond and automatically adjust tension and tensioning stroke with the tension variation of the belt conveyor. During normal operations, the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> is 0.9 – 1.1 times of the rated <b>tensile</b> <b>force,</b> during start and stop, the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> is 1.3 – 1.4 times of the rated <b>tensile</b> <b>force,</b> and during the shift of conveyor tail, the equipment can quickly respond and guarantee non-skid. The working principle is: based on the conveyor’s start-up and loading, with the feedback of tension sensor signal, the PLC controller and fuel tank can automatically adjust the output of <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> to avoid slipping between belts and drive pulley, lower the safety factor selected for the belt, and ensure the normal operation of the belt conveyor. Installed with an automatic moved conveyor tail, the automatic tensioning can be achieved when the conveyor tail is automatically moved, thus to a certain extent, the downtime rate of the belt conveyor and the downtime rate of the three face machine can be reduced.|$|R

2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E

A CNT {{was picked up by}} nanorobotics manipulator system which was constructed in SEM with 21 [*]DOFs and 1 [*]nm resolution. The CNT was picked up and placed on two manipulators. The <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> was 140 [*]nN when the CNT was pulled into two parts. Then, two parts of the CNT were connected to each other by two manipulators. The adhered force between two parts was measured to be about 20 [*]nN. When the two parts of CNT were connected again, the contact area was fused by focused electron beam irradiation for 3 minutes. The <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> of the junction was measured to be about 100 [*]nN. However, after fusion, the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> was five times larger than the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> connected only by van der Waals force. This force was 70 percent of the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> before pulling out of CNTs. The results revealed that the electron beam irradiation was a promising method for CNT fusion.

40|$|Background/purpose: Bone {{remodeling}} {{is regulated}} by the replacement of old bone with new bone through sequential osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. In this study, we compare the functional difference in osteoclastogenesis of murine macrophage when applied to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) produced by osteoblasts in response to tensile stress in a coculture system. Materials and methods: We examined the secretion of RANKL and OPG at different time points when the osteoblast cells are being cultured under <b>tensile</b> <b>force.</b> In order to confirm whether the media produced by the osteoblast cells under <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> induce osteoclastogenesis or not, murine macrophage (RAW 264. 7 cells) were cocultured with osteoblasts. Results: In both mono- and coculture systems, the two cell types cultured under <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> and in normal environment showed no significant differences (P >  0. 05) at any time. However, in the coculture system, the production of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in RAW 264. 7 cells under <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> was found to increase significantly (P <  0. 05; by 2. 27 -, 3. 00 -, or 3. 27 -fold on Day 3, Day 7, or Day 15, respectively) {{when compared with the}} corresponding TRAP activity in RAW 264. 7 cells in normal environment. Moreover, the results indicate that the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> upregulated the secretion of RANKL and inhibited OPG synthesis. Therefore, RAW 264. 7 cells appear to increase their production of TRAP in the media of osteoblasts under <b>tensile</b> <b>force,</b> increasing TRAP activity by nearly 2. 8 times compared to that in the media of osteoblasts in a normal environment for 3 days.

40|$|The <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> of {{pre-stressed}} concrete (PSC) girders {{is the most}} important factor for managing the stability of PSC bridges. The <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> is induced using pre-stressing (PS) tendons of a PSC girder. Because the PS tendons are located inside of the PSC girder, the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> cannot be measured after construction using conventional NDT (non-destructive testing) methods. To monitor the induced <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> of a PSC girder, an embedded EM (elasto-magnetic) sensor was proposed in this study. The PS tendons are made of carbon steel, a ferromagnetic material. The magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic specimen are changed according to the induced magnetic field, temperature, and induced stress. Thus, the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> of PS tendons can be estimated by measuring their magnetic properties. The EM sensor can measure the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials {{in the form of a}} B (magnetic density) -H (magnetic force) loop. To measure the B-H loop of a PS tendon in a PSC girder, the EM sensor should be embedded into the PSC girder. The proposed embedded EM sensor can be embedded into a PSC girder as a sheath joint by designing screw threads to connect with the sheath. To confirm the proposed embedded EM sensors, the experimental study was performed using a down-scaled PSC girder model. Two specimens were constructed with embedded EM sensors, and three sensors were installed in each specimen. The embedded EM sensor could measure the B-H loop of PS tendons even if it was located inside concrete, and the area of the B-H loop was proportionally decreased according to the increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>force.</b> According to the results, the proposed method can be used to estimate the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> of unrevealed PS tendons...|$|R
