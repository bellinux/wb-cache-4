5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. He proposed a reduction in property tax rates <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> increase in the assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools. The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.|$|E

The errors between PH-spline and the Bézier curve, <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> PH-spline and <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> given Bézier curve are also estimated. A new algorithm for constructing <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bézier curve is proposed...|$|R

5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people {{moved away from the}} city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> losses due to migration.|$|E

5|$|Ross said {{he wanted}} the piece to exude organic forms, drawn {{from the city and}} its surroundings. The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E

5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, tachometer, or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was a spare wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006.

5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery {{near the base}} of the dam at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Daniels {{proposed}} a property tax ceiling {{of one percent}} on residential properties, two percent for rental properties and three percent for businesses. The plan {{was approved by the}} Indiana General Assembly on March 14, 2008 and signed by Daniels on March 19, 2008. In 2008, Indiana homeowners had an average property tax cut of more than 30 percent; a total of $870 million in tax cuts. Most money collected through property taxes funds local schools and county government. <b>To</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> loss in revenues to the municipal bodies, the state raised the sales tax from 6% to 7% effective April 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and small business owners would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm.
