To assess New York State pediatricians self-perceived competency in dealing with common environmental exposures and diseases <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>origin</b> in children, we assessed their attitudes and beliefs {{about the role of}} the environment in children’s health. A four-page survey was sent to 1, 500 randomly selected members of the New York State American Academy of Pediatrics in February 2004. We obtained a 20. 3 % response rate after one follow-up mailing; respondents and nonrespondents did not differ in years of licensure or county of residence. Respondents agreed that the role of environment in children’s health is significant (mean 4. 44 ± 0. 72 on 1 – 5 Likert scale). They voiced high self-efficacy in dealing with lead exposure (mean 4. 16 – 4. 24 ± 0. 90 – 1. 05), but their confidence in their skills for addressing pesticides, mercury and mold was much lower (means 2. 51 – 3. 21 ± 0. 90 – 1. 23; p < 0. 001). About 93. 8 % would send patients to a clinic “where pediatricians could refer patients for clinical evaluation and treatment <b>of</b> their <b>environmental</b> health concerns. ” These findings indicate that New York pediatricians agree that children are suffering preventable illnesses <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>origin</b> but feel ill-equipped to educate families about common exposures.

40|$|Abstract: Humans {{are exposed}} to {{nanoparticles}} (NPs; diameter < 100 nm) from ambient air and certain workplaces. There are two main types of NPs; combustion-derived NPs (e. g., particulate matters, diesel exhaust particles, welding fumes) and manufactured or engineered NPs (e. g., titanium dioxide, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, silver, zinc oxide, copper oxide). Recently, there have been increasing reports indicating that inhaled NPs can reach the brain and {{may be associated with}} neurodegeneration. It is necessary to evaluate the potential toxic effects of NPs on brain because most of the neurobehavioral disorders may be <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>origin.</b> This review highlights studies on both combustion-derived NP- and manufactured or engineered NP-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and gene expression, as well as the possible mechanism of these effects in animal models and in humans...|$|R
