40|$|A {{cognitive}} radar (CR) {{system is}} one that observes and learns from the environment, then uses a dynamic closed-loop feedback mechanism to adapt the illumination waveform so as to provide system performance improvements over traditional radar systems. A CR system that performs multiple hypothesis target classification and exploits the spectral sparsity of correlated narrowband <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> to achieve significant performance improvements over traditional radars that use wideband illumination pulses was recently developed. This CR system, which was designed for Gaussian <b>target</b> <b>responses,</b> is extended to non-Gaussian targets. In this thesis, the CR system is generalized {{to deal effectively with}} arbitrary non-Gaussian distributed <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> via two key contributions (1) an important statistical expected value operation that is usually evaluated in closed form is evaluated numerically using an ensemble averaging operation, and (2) a powerful new statistical sampling algorithm and a kernel density estimator are applied to draw complex target samples from target distributions specified by both a desired power spectral density and an arbitrary desired probability density function. Simulations using non-Gaussian targets demonstrate very effective algorithm performance. As expected, this performance gain is realized at the expense of increased computational complexity.

Widths of dielectric layers in a linear array are adjusted to match <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> of optical transmission {{as a function of}} energy. Two complementary approaches are discussed. The first approach uses adaptive local random updates and progressively adjusts individual dielectric layer widths. The second approach is based on global updating functions in which large subgroups of layers are adjusted simultaneously. Both schemes are applied to obtain specific <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> of the transmission function within selected energy windows, such as discontinuous cut-off or power-law decay filters close to a photonic band edge. These adaptive algorithms are found to be effective tools in the custom design of nano-scale photonic dielectric structures. Comment: 4 pages Revtex, 4 embedded EPS figure...|$|R
40|$|Attackers are {{increasingly}} using large networks of compromised machines {{to carry out}} further attacks (e. g., using botnets, or enormous groups of compromised hosts {{under the control of}} a single attacker). We consider the problem of responding to entire networks of attacking computers. We identify key metrics for measuring the utility of a botnet, and describe various topological structures they may use to coordinate attacks. Using the performance metrics, we consider the ability of different response techniques to degrade or disrupt botnets. Our models show that for scale free botnets, <b>targeted</b> <b>responses</b> are particularly effective. Further, botmasters’ efforts to improve the robustness of scale free networks comes at a cost of diminished transitivity. Botmasters do not appear to have any structural solutions to this problem in scale free networks. Our models also show that random graph botnets (e. g., those using structured P 2 P formations) are highly resistant to both random and <b>targeted</b> <b>responses.</b> This suggests the urgent need for further research into response strategies. We validated our model on a particular class of botnets using star topologies. After tracking dozens of botnets over months, we located and performed a <b>targeted</b> <b>response</b> on a very large (100 K member) botnet. This resulted in an over 90 % reduction in the botnet population, and confirmed the utility of our taxonomy...|$|R
40|$|Unlike loudspeakers, {{headphones}} are {{not designed}} to have a flat frequency response. Instead they should compensate for the spectral coloration caused by the acoustic transfer path when sound is travelling from a point in space to the ear. For correct headphone reproduction {{it is essential to}} control the sound pressure at the listener's ears. In the literature, there is no consensus about the optimal transfer function and equalization of headphones. In this work, several equalization strategies were tested on different commercially available headphones. Headphones were measured on an artificial head and equalization filters were designed in the frequency domain consisting of two parts: The first part of the filter is specific for each headphone and linearizes the frequency response of the headphone at the point of measurement, i. e. {{at the beginning of the}} blocked ear-channel. The second part of the filter is generic for all headphones and allows testing of different <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> on different headphones. <b>Target</b> <b>responses</b> from literature and the ISO 11904 - 1 diffusefield equalization were tested. Further, <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> were designed by expertlisteners by directly comparing headphone and loudspeakers playback.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated priming in word association, {{an implicit}} memory task.

Priming (i. e., {{a higher proportion of}} <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> relative to a nonstudied baseline) was obtained for the congruent condition, but not for the incongruent condition. In Experiment 2, study sentences emphasized particular meaning aspects of nonambiguous targets.

5000|$|Coupling is {{the final}} concept of MPR that ties all of the {{processes}} together and allows for specific predictions of behavior with different schedules of reinforcement. Coupling refers to the association between responses and reinforcers. The <b>target</b> <b>response</b> is the response {{of interest to the}} experimenter, but any response can become associated with a reinforcer. Contingencies of reinforcement refer to how a reinforcer is scheduled with respect to the <b>target</b> <b>response</b> (Killeen & Sitomer, 2003), and the specific schedules of reinforcement in effect determine how responses are coupled to the reinforcer. The third principle of MPR states that the degree of coupling between a response and reinforcer decreases with the distance between them (Killeen & Sitomer, 2003). Coupling coefficients, designated as , are given for the different schedules of reinforcement. When the coupling coefficients are inserted into the activation-constraint model, complete models of conditioning are derived: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Compressed sensing is a {{technique}} for efficiently sampling signals which are sparse in some transform domain. Recently, the idea of compressed sensing {{has been used in}} the radar system. When the number of targets on the range-Doppler plane is small, the target scene can be reconstructed by employing the compressed sensing techniques. In this paper, we extend this idea to the MIMO radar. In the MIMO radar, the compressed sensing technique can be used to reconstruct the target scene when the signals are sparse in the range-Doppler-angle space. To effectively reconstruct the target scene, it is required that the correlation between the <b>target</b> <b>responses</b> be small. In this paper, a waveform design method is introduced to reduce the correlations between <b>target</b> <b>responses.</b> Because of the increased dimensionality in MIMO radars as compared to phased array radars, the impact of compressed sensing will be very significan...|$|R
