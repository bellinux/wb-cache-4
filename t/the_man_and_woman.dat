5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, the {{two characters}} attempt to coordinate an escape with their fellow people. A girl {{appears in a}} boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle {{from the beginning of}} the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group loads onto it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman,</b> last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which the boat is bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website.|$|E

In modern day, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> {{would most likely}} have been in courtship or a relationship prior to Ukuthwalwa. Decades before Ukuthwalwa would entail legal bridal abduction, where the man could choose a woman of his liking to be his bride and go into negotiations with {{the family of the}} bride without her knowledge or consent.

25|$|For {{the third}} person pronouns, Mixtec has several pronouns that {{indicate}} whether the referent is a man, a woman, an animal, a child or an inanimate object, a sacred or divine entity, or water. Some languages have respect forms for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> pronouns. Some languages have other pronouns as well (such as for trees.) (These pronouns show some etymological affinity to nouns for 'man', 'woman', 'tree', etc., but they are distinct from those nouns.) These may be pluralized (in some varieties, if one wishes to be explicit) by using the common plural marker de in front of them, or by using explicit plural forms that have evolved.|$|E
25|$|In {{marriage}}, {{there are}} three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage {{continue to be the}} property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.|$|E

The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> to follow them into town. After receiving water, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> sleep. The following morning, the man communicates {{with one of the}} locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, where <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E

2500|$|After some days, {{the bride}} and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests. [...] After this feast, the married couple and family {{returned}} to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch. [...] During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches. [...] Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate. [...] After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> were regarded as husband and wife.|$|E
2500|$|In the Torah, if {{a husband}} {{suspected}} {{his wife of}} adultery, there was a prescribed ordeal she underwent to determine her guilt or innocence. [...] A separate procedure was to be followed if a newlywed husband became suspicious {{that his wife had}} been promiscuous before marriage. [...] Alternatively, to enforce capital punishment for adultery, at least two witnesses were required, and both <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> involved were subject to punishment. [...] While cases of adultery could thus be difficult to prove, divorce laws added over the years enabled a husband to divorce his wife on circumstantial evidence of adultery without witnesses or additional evidence. If a woman committed unlawful intercourse against her will, she was not guilty of adultery, because she did not act as a free agent. The usual punishments were not inflicted in such cases, and the legal consequences of adultery did not follow.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> in the living room to speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|Today {{regularly}} {{holds an}} end-of-year poll. For many years this {{took the form}} of write-in votes for <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>Woman</b> of the Year. This was stopped after an episode of organised vote-rigging in 1990, but was soon revived as a telephone vote for a single Personality of the Year. A further episode of vote-rigging, in favour of Tony Blair in 1996, forced the programme-makers to consider more innovative polling questions. In 2004 listeners nominated candidates for a peerage, in 2005 the question was set of [...] "Who Runs Britain?" [...] (though this, too, turned out to be rigged). Recent years have also included nominations for a [...] "Listener's Law" [...] (which an MP agreed to sponsor as a parliamentary bill, although he did not support the winning nomination, which he thought was not appropriate), and, in 2006, nominations were sought for the law that listeners would most like to see repealed.|$|E
2500|$|There is a Christian element {{present in}} Sonnet 144. Shakespeare refers to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> as angels. Helen Vendler {{believes}} that the boy represents salvations while the woman is sin. [...] "Q1 offers the familiar Christian model of the better angel and the worser spirit, both prompting the speaking, but transforms these spirits into loves, and gives them names deriving from theology: comfort (salvation) and despair (the unforgivable sin). The iconographic description fair/ colored ill [...] supports the Christian model of angel and devil." [...] The bad angel comes between the poet and the good angel. [...] "Q2 while beginning with the Christian presumption that the bad angel wants to win [...] soon to hell, slides away from the motive in lines 7-8, as a witty {{new version of the}} old plot emerges; the bad angel loses interest in the speaker, and turns her interest to the better spirit." [...] Sonnet 144 reflects Shakespeare's relationships with young boy and the dark lady through the use of Christian images.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} family patterns {{that emerged in}} Christian Europe throughout the Middle Ages. [...] In most of Southern and Eastern Europe, marriage occurred between two individuals who had lived with their parents {{for a long period}} of time. [...] The man involved was older, usually in his late twenties, and the girl was often still a teenager. [...] Their household would contain several generations, an occurrence demographers denote as a [...] "complex" [...] household. [...] In contrast, areas in Northwestern Europe gave rise to a familial structure that was unique for the time period. [...] <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> were typically around the same age, and would wait until they were in their early twenties to marry. [...] Following the marriage, the couple would set up their own independent household (termed a [...] "nuclear" [...] household structure). [...] This led to a lower birthrate, as well as greater levels of economic stability for the new couple. [...] This also served as a check on the increasing population in Europe. [...] Many women in this region during this time period would never marry at all.|$|E
2500|$|Following Alex & Amanda's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Words of Love" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in heats; the men went first, and were {{followed}} by the women. The HouseGuests were asked questions about the various quotes hanging {{on the walls of}} the house. If a HouseGuest answered a question correctly, they would eliminate one HouseGuest from the competition; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> who won each round would then face off in the final round, with the winner earning both them and their partner the title of Head of Household for the week. Joshuah & Sharon were the winners. Shortly following their win, Joshuah and Allison engaged in numerous verbal arguments due to Joshuah being mad at Allison for changing her vote last minute, as well as the lesbian lie she had told earlier in the game. Due to these arguments, Allison debated quitting the game, though was later convinced in the Diary Room to stay; she did, however, have a restraining order placed on Joshuah, and he was forbidden to be within five feet of her. On Day 22, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Big Aspara-Guess!" [...] food competition. For this competition, the men were required to guess the weight of their partners and then gather enough asparagus to weigh the same amount. If they got within ten pounds of their partner's weight, the HouseGuests won the two major food groups that couple represented. Later that day, Joshuah & Sharon chose to nominate Allison & Ryan and Matt & Natalie for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam & Sheila were selected to compete; James was selected to host. On Day 23, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Cupid is as Cupid Does" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the couples were required to solve a puzzle by lifting the women into the air through a harness, while the men ran the puzzle pieces to them. Matt & Natalie were the winners of the Power of Veto. On Day 24, the HouseGuests learned that sometime in the coming weeks an alarm would go off in the house, and this meant that a twist would occur. On Day 25, Matt & Natalie chose to use the Power of Veto to remove themselves from the block, with Adam & Sheila being nominated in their place. On Day 28, Allison and Ryan were announced as the fourth couple to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of two to zero. Before they could exit the house, however, the alarm went off, and the HouseGuests learned that they were officially playing the game as individuals. The HouseGuests then learned that they would be voting to evict either Allison or Ryan from the house, rather than the both of them being evicted. Allison then became the first individual HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.|$|E
