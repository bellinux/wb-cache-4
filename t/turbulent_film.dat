40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in our understanding of the complex flow processes in individual fractures, aided by flow visualization experiments and conceptual modeling efforts. These advances have led to the recognition of several flow regimes in individual fractures subjected to different initial and boundary conditions. Of these, the most important regimes are film flow, rivulet flow, and sliding of droplets. The existence of such significantly dissimilar flow regimes has been a major hindrance in the development of self-consistent conceptual models of flow for single fractures that encompass all the flow regimes. The objective {{of this study is to}} delineate the existence of the different flow regimes in individual fractures. For steady-state flow conditions, we developed physical constraints on the different flow regimes that satisfy minimum energy configurations, which enabled us to segregate the wide range of fracture transmissivity (volumetric flow rate per fracture width) into several flow regimes. These are, in increasing order of flow rate, flow of adsorbed films, flow of sliding drops, rivulet flow, stable film flow, and unstable (<b>turbulent)</b> <b>film</b> flow.

From the experimental results of laminar-wavy and <b>turbulent</b> <b>films</b> dimensionless approximation equations for different parameters were determined for {{the description of the}} film flow like the film thickness, wave frequency and the wave velocity. Furthermore new boundaries for the different film regimes could be discriminated from the results. A substantial part of the work was the development of more suitable temporally and locally high resolving measurement techniques.

A further component of the work was the measurement of the film velocity of periodically excited two-dimensional-wavy films with the Particle Image Velocimetry PIV. The velocity field of a complete length of a two-dimensional wave could be reconstructed by simultaneous film thickness measurements. By measurements of the wall temperature distribution with a developed measuring system on the basis of the infrared thermography the influence of the wavy surface on the heat transfer within the laminar-wavy flow range could be examined.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 There is renewed {{interest}} in the reliability and safety of nuclear power plants following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident followed by 8. 9 magnitude earthquake and Tsunami with the height of 15 m on March 11, 2011. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) {{have been developed to}} improve safety systems by utilizing passive and natural circulation forces under normal operations and accident conditions. One key feature of the safety systems in SMRs is the use of containment condensation to prevent core melt down. For further development of the SMR for design certifications, the condensation model at relatively high pressures compared with current operating power plants should be verified and validated. For this process, at Oregon State University, the MASLWR (Multi Application Small Light Water Reactor) test facility, which has 1 : 3 length scale, can perform integrated tests on containment condensation of SMRs. Using the MASLWR test facility experimental data, this study investigated three major subjects: heat flux estimation on the containment wall, flow transition of condensation film flow dynamics and assessing the scaling effects of the MASLWR test facility. An inverse heat conduction algorithm was developed to estimate the heat fluxes of film condensation at the containment wall in the MASLWR test facility during transients. Through a fundamental one-dimensional approach for condensation film flow, the governing equations were derived and numerically solved. A linear perturbation stability analysis using steady-state results of condensation film flow at the containment wall found that Re 1600 is the transition point between laminar and <b>turbulent</b> <b>film</b> flow regimes. This finding agreed with the experimental results of Ishigai et al. (1974) and Morioka et al. (1993).

40|$|In this thesis, a {{numerical}} study of film cooling in hypersonic laminar and turbulent flows has been performed using an in-house Navier-Stokes solver. The {{aim of this}} computational work is to investigate the mechanism and effectiveness of film cooling in hypersonic laminar and turbulent flows. Hypersonic flow over a flat plate without film cooling was first studied to provide a reference datum to check the effectiveness of film cooling. For laminar film cooling (M¥ = 9. 9), three different primary flow conditions were first used for validation. The inclusion {{of the development of}} the flow in the plenum chamber upstream of the slot was found to provide better heat prediction than a uniform boundary condition at the slot exit. Detailed information of the flow field including velocity profile, Mach contour, temperature contour and heat transfer rate was presented. The mechanism of film cooling has been revealed according to the plots of calculated velocity profiles, Mach contours and temperature contours downstream of the slot. The coolant fluid was found to affect the primary boundary layer in two ways: 1) initially a separate layer established by the coolant fluid itself in the near slot area, 2) later a mixing layer between the primary and coolant flow streams. Then five coolant injection rates between 2. 95 x 10 - 4 and 7. 33 x 10 - 4 kg/s and three slot heights 0. 8382, 1. 2192, 1. 6002 mm, were examined in hypersonic laminar film cooling. For <b>turbulent</b> <b>film</b> cooling (M¥ = 8. 2), for the geometry used in the experiment, the injection at an angle of 20 ° was found to be appropriate. Different turbulence models including Wilcox's k - w model. Menter's baseline and SST model have been tested. It is concluded that the Wilcox's k - w turbulence model with dilatation-dissipation correction provides the best heat prediction. Again, five coolant injection rates varies from 5. 07 x 10 - 4 to 30. 69 x 10 - 4 kg/s and three slot heights (the same as studied in the laminar film cooling) were studied to check the influence on film cooling effectiveness. Both the coolant and the primary flow were air. Film cooling was found to be an effective way to protect wall surfaces that are exposed under a high heat transfer environment especially in hypersonic laminar flow. Increasing the coolant injection rate can obviously increase the film cooling effectiveness. Again, this works better in laminar flow than in turbulent flow. The coolant injection rate in turbulent flow should be considered to be high enough to give good heat protection. Slot height in both laminar and turbulent flows under the flow conditions in this study was found to be less important, which means other factors can be considered in priority when constructing film cooling systems. With the application of curve fitting, the cooling length was described using power laws according to curve fitting results. A two-equation film coating model has been presented to illustrate the relation between the film cooling effectiveness and the parameter x/(h/m). For film cooling effectiveness in log-log coordinates, a second-order polynomial curve can be used to fit the laminar flows, whilst a straight line is suitable for the turbulent flows...|$|E

40|$|A study {{concerning}} closure relations {{pertinent to}} the design of sorption equipment of absorption heat pumps has been undertaken.

Empirical correlations were produced for all quantities. Furthermore, a semi-theoretical model for the void fraction was derived; this model compared favourably to existing correlations. Sample thermosiphon calculations using a two-field two-phase flow model, including a heating condensate film, were performed.

40|$|Experiments are {{performed}} to investigate condensation of FC- 72 along parallel, square micro-channels with a hydraulic diameter of 1 mm and {{a length of}} 29. 9 cm, which are formed in the top surface of a solid copper plate. The condensation is achieved by rejecting heat to a counter flow of water through channels brazed to {{the underside of the}} copper plate. Using high-speed video imaging and photomicrographic techniques, five distinct flow regimes are identified: smooth-annular, wavy-annular, transition, slug, and bubbly, with the smooth-annular and wavy-annular regimes being most prevalent. A new heat transfer coefficient correlation is proposed for annular condensation in mini/micro-channels. It shows excellent predictive capability based on both the present experimental data and the database for mini/micro-channel flows amassed from eight previous sources. ^ A theoretical control-volume-based model for annular condensing flow is proposed where mass and momentum conservations are applied to control volumes encompassing the liquid film and the vapor core separately. The model accounts for interfacial suppression of turbulent eddies due to surface tension {{with the aid of a}} new eddy diffusivity model specifically tailored to shear-driven <b>turbulent</b> <b>films.</b> The new model accurately captures the present pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient data in both magnitude and trend. ^ This study also explored heat diffusion effects in micro-channel heat sinks. Detailed analytical models are constructed for heat sinks having micro-channels with rectangular, inverse trapezoidal, triangular, trapezoidal, and diamond-shaped cross sections. For a circular micro-channel, an alternative analytical power series solution technique is presented due to a singularity point in the governing heat diffusion equation. The analytical results are compared to one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical simulations for different micro-channel diameters, aspect ratios, fin spacings, and Biot numbers. This study proves the analytical models are very effective tools for the design and thermal resistance prediction of micro-channel heat sinks. ^ Universal approaches to predicting the two-phase frictional pressure drop and the heat transfer coefficient in condensing and boiling mini/micro-channel flows are proposed that are capable of tackling many fluids with drastically different thermophysical properties and very broad ranges of all geometrical and flow parameters of practical interest. For the frictional pressure drop in condensing and adiabatic flows, a universal approach is proposed by incorporating appropriate dimensionless relations in a separated flow model to account for both small channel size and different combinations of liquid and vapor states. For the heat transfer coefficient in mini/micro-channel condensing flows, two new correlations are proposed, one for predominantly annular flows, and the second for slug and bubbly flows. For the frictional pressure gradient in boiling mini/micro-channel flows, the separated flow technique developed for non-boiling (condensing and adiabatic) mini/micro-channel flows is modified to account for the differences in frictional pressure gradient predictions between non-boiling versus boiling mini/micro-channel flows. For the boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-channel flows, a correlation for the dryout incident quality is first proposed to exclude the partial dryout data. Two new correlations for saturated boiling mini/micro-channel flows are then proposed, one for nucleate boiling dominant regime, and the other for convective boiling dominant regime. These new approaches are shown to provide excellent predictions of the consolidated database. It is shown this accuracy is fairly even for different working fluids, and over broad ranges of hydraulic diameter, mass velocity, quality and pressure, and for both single and multiple mini/micro-channels. ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid films falling {{under the}} {{influence}} of gravity are widely encountered in a variety of industrial two-phase flow applications (distillation columns, nuclear reactor cores, etc.). In addition, the falling annular film represents a fundamental limiting case of the annular flow regime of two-phase gas-liquid flows. The literature on annular falling films is dominated by studies concerning the average film thickness. Information on more detailed characteristics of the film thickness variations and information on the velocity profile within the film and wall shear stress are much less common. The statistical description of the film thickness is {{complicated by the fact that}} practically all flows of interest occur in the turbulent regime. Due to the complex and unsteady nature of the <b>turbulent</b> annular falling <b>film,</b> no complete theories or models have yet been developed on the subject. Experimental studies are needed to gain insight into the basic mechanisms that govern this complex flow. The primary purpose of this thesis research was to characterise the film thickness of falling annular films at high and very high Reynolds numbers using non-intrusive imaging techniques. Another objective was to develop ray-tracing techniques to reduce optical distortion and obtain high-quality experimental data. Instantaneous film thickness measurements of falling annular films were extracted at five different Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 1000 ~ 6000 for the fully developed turbulent regime using an automated optical measurement technique. From visual observation of the images obtained it was found that waves were not axisymmetric, i. e., there was substantial azimuthal variation in <b>film</b> thickness. The <b>turbulent</b> waves appeared to be similar in appearance to very large breaking ocean waves driven by strong winds. The random nature of these falling annular films was subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical characteristics of film thickness were studied at Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 1000 ~ 6000. A correlation for dimensionless mean film thickness was obtained in the turbulent flow regime. The dimensionless mean film thickness obtained here was found to be in reasonable agreement with the other established experimental and theoretical studies. It was shown that the Reynolds number influences the statistical characteristics of film thickness such as standard deviation and coefficient of variation. The additional data obtained here shows that the standard deviation continues to increase in proportion to the mean film thickness in the turbulent regime. In other words, in the lower <b>turbulent</b> zones the <b>films</b> are thin and less wavy, whereas in the higher <b>turbulent</b> zones the <b>films</b> are thicker and extremely wavy in nature. The probability density distributions were also obtained. It was found that the measured probability density distributions were asymmetric. They all had a maximum peak and were skewed to the right hand side with a long tail that stretched to over six times the peak value. The maximum peak could be considered to represent the modal value of the film thickness or the substrate film thickness. The increase in skewness and the decrease in the height of the peak with liquid Reynolds number could be attributed to the presence of large disturbance waves which ride on the substrate film. This enhances the waviness of the film. A common problem in imaging flows in cylindrical tubes is the optical distortion caused by the wall curvature. To minimize this problem the cylindrical tube was surrounded by an optical correction box with flat walls filled with water. In addition, an advanced ray tracing model was employed to reduce optical distortion effects in the cylindrical tube. This technique increased the accuracy of the imaging technique and enabled quantitative measurements of film thickness to be made...|$|R

The measurements were taken out from two different positions in the pipe. Different flow rates from water and gas were also tested. The primary purpose was to investigate how the film thickness varies with time, under different flow conditions. Another objective was wave frequency analysis to obtain a perspective on the wave behaviour. The measurements from the film thickness fluctuations gave some agreements with previous analysis. The data shows how the mean film thickness increases with the liquid flow rates but the gas flow rates give more variation in the structure {{and the movement of}} the film. Besides, it was observed that above gas velocity around 14. 5 m/s and water velocity about 0. 0026 m/s, the liquid film thickness is almost constant. In the liquid film fluctuations figures, the time-traces curves were almost evenly. Furthermore, the frequency analysis has shown some attractive observations how the shape and structures of the waves vary with flow regime. The dominant waves or in other words the highest peaks have been more appearing in position 1 near the water inlet. In other hands, the smaller waves were more appearing when the gas velocity increases. Some of the statistical characteristics of film thickness were also studied such as standard deviations. The data obtained illustrate that the standard deviations increase proportional with the mean film thickness. Also the maximum standard deviation in relation to the mean thickness has been 35 %.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Effects of embedded longitudinal vortices on heat transfer in a <b>turbulent</b> boundary layer <b>film</b> cooled {{from a single}} injection hole are discussed. Film coolant was injected at blowing ratios 0. 50 to 1. 50 at a freestream velocity of 10 m/s. A single longitudinal vortex was induced upstream of the film-cooling holes. Heat transfer measurements were made downstream of injection. Flow visualization tests were conducted after the injectant was contaminated with smoke. Surveys of mean velocity and mean temperature were also made in different spanwise normal planes. For all blowing ratios examined, the embedded vortices cause significant alterations to wall heat transfer and to film-cooling distributions. Measurement of mean temperature and mean velocities in spanwise planes show that injectant is pushed to the upwash side of the vortex when the injection hole is located beneath the vortex core or vortex downwash. Evidence of injection is seen only for x/d< 7. 4. For other injection locations {{with respect to the}} vortex core, evidence of injectant appears for x/d up to 96, and the injectant is not swept into the vortex upwash by secondary flows.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} numerical model for <b>turbulent,</b> free-falling liquid <b>films</b> subjected to sensible heating and to explore the influence of interfacial waves on mass, momentum and heat transfer. The model is used to explore the influences of waves and interfacial dampening of turbulent eddies on fluid flow and heat transfer. The model represents two-dimensional axisymmetric film flow on a vertical circular tube, with both the computational domain and operating conditions matching those of an experimental database for water films. Interfacial waves are observed to be prevalent for all operating conditions and associated with a dominant repeated wave shape. Good agreement is achieved between the predicted axial variations of the heat transfer coefficient and experimental data, including an upstream decline in the upstream thermal development region, and slow downstream increase resulting from intensified turbulence and interfacial waviness. Predicted relations for both the film thickness and heat transfer coefficient are shown to agree well with popular experimental correlations. It is shown that turbulence is fully suppressed at the interface, with zero eddy diffusivity both at the wall and interface, and a maximum in between. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{condensation}} of FC- 72 through a microchannel heat sink cooled by a counterflow {{of water in}} tubes that are soldered to {{the underside of the}} heat sink. The microchannels were formed by machining 10 of 1 mm square grooves across the 20. 1 mm width of a 300. 0 mm long copper plate, which was topped with a transparent plastic plate. Experiments were performed with the FC- 72 spanning the following conditions: inlet pressure of 104. 0 - 133. 0 kPa (15. 09 - 19. 29 psi), flow rate of 0. 682 - 3. 665 g/s, inlet quality of 1. 0 - 1. 1, and with water flow rates of 2. 97 - 5. 95 g/s. Both pressure drop and temperature drop were measured in the FC- 72 across the heat sink. In addition, temperatures were measured at many locations within the copper plate. These measurements were used to explore trends in both the pressure drop and condensation heat transfer coefficient. Measured pressure drop and condensation heat transfer coefficient values ranged from 0. 547 to 24. 832 kPa (0. 08 to 3. 60 psi) and 176. 08 to 11, 448 W/m 2 -K, respectively. Pressure drop was found to increase with increasing flow rate of FC- 72. The condensation heat transfer coefficient was highest at the channel inlet and increased with increasing flow rate of FC- 72 and/or deceasing flow rate of water. In addition to the measurements, high-speed and close-up photographic techniques were used to map dominant two-phase flow regimes and determine operating conditions that yield the annular flow regime responsible for netting the highest heat transfer coefficients. A new <b>turbulent</b> annular <b>film</b> model recently developed at the Boiling and Two-Phase Flow Laboratory (BTPFL) is shown to predict both the pressure drop and the condensation heat transfer coefficient for the annular regime with high degrees of accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Advisor: Ronald J. ZborayFROM HOLLYWOOD TO SHANGHAI: AMERICAN SILENT FILMS IN CHINAQian Zhang, PhDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2009 AbstractMy {{dissertation}} re-constructs {{the history}} of Hollywood movies in 1920 s Shanghai through archival work in both China and the United States. Before that decade, film exhibition in China {{was little more than}} a novelty with limited social influence. The 1920 s saw a boom in American film production and attempts to develop foreign markets for it. Consequently, Hollywood films flooded into China, just ahead of the development of the local national film industry in the late 1920 s, and hence shaped the environment for that development. As heralds of a new medium with unprecedented capacity for shaping people's perceptions, beliefs, and viewpoints, American films were received and interpreted by Chinese audiences in a transnational context. My research is mostly based on rarely or never used primary sources both in the United States and China, mainly in archives including the U. S. official documents of the Department of State located at the National Archives, the special collection of the United Artists at the Wisconsin State Historical Society Library, indexed New York Times, and D. W. Griffith's unpublished documents such as D. W. Griffith Papers 1897 - 1954, 1927 Yearbook of Chinese Cinema, 1920 s fan magazines such as The Movie Guide, The China Film Pictorial, The Stage and Screen, The Photoplay World, Photoplay Pictorial, The Movie Magazine, and Cineograph, a collection of film plot sheets, and local popular magazines such as The Good Companion. Through my dissertation, I have found that the promotion and consumption of American films in 1920 s Shanghai did not result in a homogeneous American culture as the Chinese re-deployed, re-invented, and appropriated American films for local political, cultural, and social discourses. During that <b>turbulent</b> decade, Hollywood <b>films</b> played into the Chinese political discourse of nationalism and modernity. The modernity discourse was prominent in the Chinese filmic texts and extra-textual filmic spheres. Hollywood's impact on China can be examined by the reaction of the Chinese film industry toward American films, the changing lifestyle of Chinese locals, and their perception of American people and values...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from single-phase to two-phase thermal systems in future space vehicles demands {{a thorough understanding}} of phase change methods in reduced gravity, including microgravity. In this study, phase change methods like flow boiling, flow condensation and evaporative falling-films are investigated experimentally, theoretically and computationally. ^ The experimental part of the study consists of an investigation of the influence of inlet subcooling and two-phase inlet on flow boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux in a horizontal 2. 5 -mm wide by 5 -mm high rectangular channel in different orientations with respect to Earth gravity using FC- 72 as working fluid. High-speed video imaging is used to identify dominant interfacial characteristics for different combinations of inlet conditions and heating configurations. Gravity is shown having a dominant influence on interfacial behavior at low mass velocities, while inertia dwarfs gravity effects at high mass velocities. CHF variation between different orientations with respect to Earth gravity is large for low mass velocities and diminishes for high mass velocities. ^ In the theoretical part of the study, a consolidated investigation of the complex trends of flow boiling CHF in a rectangular channel in both microgravity and for different orientations in Earth gravity are performed. Separate theoretical models are constructed to investigate subcooled inlet flows and saturated two-phase inlet flows. It is shown that the Interfacial Lift-off Model provides good predictions of CHF data for both gravitational environments, both single-sided and double-sided heating, and both subcooled and saturated inlet conditions. ^ In the computational part of the study, CFD models are constructed for two separate phase change configurations. First, <b>turbulent,</b> free-falling liquid <b>films</b> subjected to evaporative heating, and second, annular flow condensation in vertical upflow configuration. Implemented in FLUENT, the models are used to predict variations of various flow and thermal parameters and compare the results with available experimental data. Energy transfer at the two-phase interface are implemented successfully with the aid of appropriate phase change models. For both phase change configurations, the CFD model was able to capture complex flow behavior observed in experiments and predict heat transfer coefficients with reasonable accuracy. Also included in this part is a comprehensive review of literature on computational modeling of various boiling and condensation applications. This part of the study is laying the groundwork for future implementation of CFD models in capturing more complicated flow boiling and CHF phenomena. ...|$|R
