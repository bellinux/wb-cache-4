In a magnetic field, electrons follow helical paths around magnetic field lines, undergoing more ionizing collisions with gaseous neutrals near the target surface than would otherwise occur. (As the target material is depleted, a [...] "racetrack" [...] erosion profile may appear on the surface of the target.) The sputter gas is typically an inert gas such as argon. The extra argon ions created as a result of these collisions lead to a higher deposition rate. The plasma can also be sustained at a lower pressure this way. The sputtered atoms are neutrally charged and so are unaffected by the magnetic <b>trap.</b> <b>Charge</b> build-up on insulating targets can be avoided with the use of RF sputtering where the sign of the anode-cathode bias is varied at a high rate (commonly 13.56 MHz). RF sputtering works well to produce highly insulating oxide films but with the added expense of RF power supplies and impedance matching networks. Stray magnetic fields leaking from ferromagnetic targets also disturb the sputtering process. Specially designed sputter guns with unusually strong permanent magnets must often be used in compensation.|$|E

The presence of interface trap states detrimentally affects the device drain current–gate voltage relationship I ds – V gs. At the moment, there is no analytical method available to extract the interface trap distribution of metal-oxide-graphene field effect transistor (MOGFET) devices.

Although consistent and repeatable hysteresis {{could possibly be}} attractive for memory based applications, it is detrimental to the deployment of graphene in high speed electronic switches. While the origin of such hysteresis has been variously attributed to graphene-insulator interface traps, adsorbed molecules and bulk charges in the dielectric, its dependence {{on the quality of}} the graphene has been largely unexplored. Since, CVD is the most promising synthesis route for large area graphene and defects in such a growth process are inevitable, it is important to understand the influence of the quality of graphene on hysteresis.
