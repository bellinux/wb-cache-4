5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent.

Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E

30|$|Finally, we {{prove that}} <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> choice of Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is order-optimal. First, {{we show that}} no scaling order larger than this results in higher throughput. We have {{observed}} that by <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> of Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)), <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> of R 1 is as R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)). Choosing a larger scaling than Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) for Q, does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of R 1. That is because R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is <b>the</b> best achievable <b>scaling</b> even in <b>the</b> case of Q[*]=[*]∞. Thus, increasing <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of Q does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of R 1. On the other hand, this action will deteriorate the pre-constant factor by increasing the third phase load. Consequently, no scaling larger than Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is <b>the</b> optimum <b>scaling</b> order.|$|R

The {{influence}} of a thermodynamic constraint on <b>the</b> critical finite-size <b>scaling</b> behavior of three-dimensional Ising and XY models is analyzed by Monte-Carlo simulations. Within the Ising universality class constraints lead to Fisher renormalized critical exponents, which modify the asymptotic form of <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> arguments of <b>the</b> universal finite-size <b>scaling</b> functions. Within <b>the</b> XY universality class constraints lead to very slowly decaying corrections inside <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> arguments, which are governed by the specific heat exponent α. If the modification of <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> arguments is properly {{taken into account in}} <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> analysis of <b>the</b> data, finite-size <b>scaling</b> functions are obtained, which are independent of the constraint as anticipated by analytic theory. ...|$|R
