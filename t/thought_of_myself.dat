"Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda had never occurred to me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> since I was such a huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|On February21,1985, Yankovic began {{recording}} the parodies for Dare to Be Stupid. The first parody recorded for {{the album was}} [...] "Yoda". [...] "Yoda" [...] was originally written by Yankovic during the initial run of the 1980 American film The Empire Strikes Back. After {{the success of the}} movie, Yankovic {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable song to use as the base. Yankovic remembers, [...] "I was still in college at the time, and a friend of mine named Mike suggested that I do the song to the tune of 'Lola'—which I couldn't believe that I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> since I was such a huge Kinks fan." [...] Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a four-track cassette Portastudio. This version of [...] "Yoda" [...] was a hit on the [...] "Dr. Demento Show", and even managed to hit, and hold onto, number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes.|$|E

60|$|It {{was during}} my being here, for here we stayed near two months, that I grew very {{thoughtful}} about my circumstances; not {{as to the}} danger, neither indeed were we in any, but were entirely concealed and unsuspected; but I really began to have other <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and <b>of</b> the world, than ever I had before.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring {{to a time when}} the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E
2500|$|Brooks said of {{his role}} as Hawk: [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as the sidekick... I've never been the side of anything. I just assumed that I was equal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{has been}} {{referred}} to, along with Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, {{as one of}} the [...] "new atheists", but he considers the term [...] "atheist" [...] to be problematic. He said, [...] "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as an atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, {{in the same way that}} we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know, ma tante," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "but somehow I {{have always felt}} that one day I might {{be called upon to}} do {{something}} for France. There are times when that feeling becomes so strong that all <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and <b>of</b> my own happiness fade from my knowledge, and it seems as if my duty to France and to the King were more insistent than my duty to God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] Burnamy {{replied in}} kind, [...] "he buys my poverty and not my will. And perhaps if I <b>thought</b> better <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> I should respect him more." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the public}} controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory {{suspended}} Watson's administrative responsibilities. On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a racist. I don't {{see myself as a}} racist. I am mortified by it. It was the worst thing in my life." [...] An editorial in Nature at the time acknowledged that his remarks were [...] "beyond the pale," [...] but wished that the tour had not been cancelled so that Watson would be forced to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{described}} her upbringing as [...] "very quiet and happy." [...] At age three, she {{took part in}} her first singing competition at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival. She took part in pantomimes at Gweedore Theatre and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's church in Derrybeg. She learned English at primary school and began piano lessons at age four. [...] "I had to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I ... remember {{my brothers and sisters}} playing outside ... and I would be inside playing the piano. This one big book of scales, practising them over and over." [...] At eleven, Enya's grandfather paid for her education at a strict convent boarding school in Milford run by nuns of the Loreto order, where she developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin and watercolour painting. [...] "It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family, but it was good for my music." [...] Enya left the school at 17 and studied classical music in college for one year with the aim of becoming [...] "a piano teacher sort of person. I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> composing or being on stage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true. I had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that <b>myself.</b> But then there's a {{particular}} reason for my telling you this. It {{is about a}} young lady! You won't tell; will you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Zorn {{was quoted}} in 1998 as saying [...] "Sometimes I {{get the feeling that}} people just don't see me as a {{composer}}, but it's what I've always been since I was eight years old... I've always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a composer, but the world has had a hard time looking at me as a composer because a lot of what I compose is controversial." [...] The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had been written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn's earliest released [...] "classical" [...] composition (for five flutes), [...] "Christabel" [...] (1972) first appeared on Angelus Novus in 1998. Zorn credits the composition of his 1988 piece for string quartet [...] "Cat O' Nine Tails", commissioned and originally released by the Kronos Quartet (Short Stories), to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition was featured on The String Quartets (1999) and Cartoon S/M (2000) along with variations on [...] "Kol Nidre", inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written {{at the same time as}} (but not part of) the first Masada Book. [...] (1998) was Zorn's first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children's Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.|$|E

"Why, no--I rather believe I <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> at the moment," [...] {{returned}} Charles; [...] "but then, Julia, {{you must}} do me the justice to say, that instantly I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the danger of your taking cold and drew you into the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure. There is {{that way}} of looking at it. That's rather novel; I wish I had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that <b>myself.</b> She was {{certainly}} more to blame than we were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{a perfect}} Babel of strange tongues; and he's the very {{man for the}} work, and I was ashamed I hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him <b>myself,</b> for I suspect he needs the work." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I recoiled {{in horror}} and disgust. Was this his clemency--this sparing {{of my life}} that he might submit it to an eternal shame? For a moment my mother was forgotten. I <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and I grew {{resolved}} to hang.|$|R

60|$|Sir Mart. Lord, cousin, what a-do is {{here with}} your counsel! As though I could not have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that <b>myself.</b> I could find in my heart not to send him now----stay a little----I could soon find out some other way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, perfectly--perfectly!" [...] She hastily interrupted. [...] "I wouldn't have it otherwise. Of course," [...] she added, [...] "it wasn't very {{pleasant}} having some one else suggest what I {{ought to have}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and seem more delicate about you than I was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} that," [...] he said gravely. [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a {{particularly}} emotional person.

60|$|Was she {{thinking}} {{of fire and}} the stake? I think not. I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it <b>myself,</b> but I believe she was only {{thinking of}} this slow and cruel martyrdom of chains and captivity and insult. Surely, martyrdom was the right name for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that <b>myself,</b> my lord; but he's as wary as a weazel, and I'm afeard {{he smells}} {{something}} in the wind.
