60|$|Five minutes {{afterwards}} my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man's back, carried {{up to the}} forecastle, {{and laid}} in a bunk on some sea-blankets; where the first <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to lose my senses.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} to be plain with you, Mr Headstone,' said young Hexam, shaking his head in a half-threatening manner, 'because this is no time for {{affecting}} not to know <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know--except certain things at which it might not be very safe for you, to hint again. What I mean is this: if you were a good master, I was a good pupil. I have done you plenty of credit, and in improving my own reputation I have improved yours quite as much. Very well then. Starting on equal terms, I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me, for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister. You have compromised me by being seen about with me, endeavouring to counteract this Mr Eugene Wrayburn. That's the first thing you have done. If my character, and my now dropping you, help me out of that, Mr Headstone, the deliverance is to be attributed to me, and not to you. No thanks to you for it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, this is {{just what}} my husband knew also. Once when they were [...] chatting {{together}} Herbert mentioned that the house like many other [...] old mansions contained a secret chamber. He said: 'I can't tell [...] you where it is, Withers; for although it is never likely to be [...] used again, the knowledge of this hiding-place has been passed [...] down {{from generation to generation}} as a family secret. I gave a [...] solemn promise never to reveal it when I was first informed of its [...] existence; and although in these days there is no occasion to hide [...] priests or conspirators, I do not consider myself released from [...] the promise I gave. Possibly some day the hiding-place may prove [...] of value again. There may be a price set on the head of a Penfold, [...] who can tell? Anyhow it is likely to remain a secret as long as [...] the old house stands; and in the meantime I find it a useful place [...] for keeping <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want lying about.' Mr. Tallboys [...] appeared very vexed at hearing what my husband said.|$|E
60|$|Now, Clawbonny was not then, {{nor is it}} now, {{what might}} be called a legal term. There was no such place known in law, beyond the right which usage gives; and I heard a low laugh among the {{passengers}} of the Gull, as they heard the homely appellation. This came from the equivocal position my family occupied, midway between the gentry and yeomanry of the State, as they both existed in 1803. Had I said the sloop came from near Coldenham, it would have been all right; for everybody who was then anybody in New York, knew who the Coldens were; or Morrisania, the Morrises being people of mark; or twenty other places on the river: but the Wallingfords were as little known as Clawbonny, when you got fifteen or twenty miles from the spot where they had so long lived. This is just the difference between obscurity and notoriety. When the latter extends to an entire nation, it gives an individual, or a family, the note that frees them entirely from the imputation of existing under the first condition; and this note, favourably diffused through Christendom, forms a reputation--transmitted to posterity, it becomes fame. Unfortunately, neither we nor our place had even reached the first simple step in this scale of renown; and poor Clawbonny was laughed at, on account of something Dutch that was probably supposed to exist in the sound--the Anglo-Saxon race having a singular aptitude to turn up their nose's at everything but their own possessions, and everybody but themselves. I looked at Lucy, with sensitive quickness, to see how she received this sneer on my birth-place; but, with her, it was so much a matter of course to think well of everything connected with the spot, its name as well as its more essential <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe she perceived this little sign of derision.|$|E
5000|$|... "One <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{love about}} her {{is that she}} is really multidimensional," [...] she went on to say in the same interview. [...] "I think it's nice to have a female {{character}} that is portrayed in (a) really holistic way." ...|$|R

6000|$|The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli am singing. Let the [...] jungle {{listen to}} the things I have done. Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill! At the gates [...] in the {{twilight}} he would kill Mowgli, the Frog! He ate and he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when [...] wilt thou drink again? Sleep and dream of the kill. I am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother come to me! [...] Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot! Bring up the great bull-buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd-bulls [...] with the angry eyes. Drive them to and fro as I order. [...] Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, O wake! Here come I, [...] and the bulls are behind. Rama {{the king of the}} buffaloes stamped with his foot. [...] Waters of the Waingunga whither went Shere Khan? He is not Sahi to dig holes, nor Mor, the Peacock, that he [...] should fly. He is not Mang, the Bat, to hang in the branches. [...] Little bamboos that creak together tell me where he ran? Ow! he is there. Ahoo! he is there. Under the feet of Rama lies [...] the Lame One! Up, Shere Khan! Up and kill! Here is meat; break the [...] necks of the bulls. Hsh! he is asleep. We will not wake him, for his strength is very [...] great. The kites have come down to see it. The black ants have [...] come up to know it. There is a great assembly in his honour. Alala! I have no cloth to wrap me. The kites will see that I am [...] naked. I am ashamed to meet all these people. Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay striped coat that [...] I may go to the Council Rock. By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise. [...] Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word. With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife [...] of the hunter, I will stoop down for my gift. Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love [...] that he bears me. Pull, Gray Brother! [...] Pull, Akela! Heavy is the hide of Shere Khan. The Man Pack are angry. They throw stones and talk child's talk. [...] My mouth is bleeding. Let me run away. Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my [...] brothers. We will leave the lights of the village and go to the [...] low moon. Waters of the Waingunga, the Man Pack have cast me out. I did them [...] no harm, but they were afraid of me. Why? Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too. The Jungle is shut to me and the [...] village gates are shut. Why? As Mang flies between the beasts and birds so fly I between the [...] village and the Jungle. Why? I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy. My [...] mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but [...] my heart is very light, because I have come back to the Jungle. [...] Why? These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the [...] spring. The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it [...] falls. Why? I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet. All the Jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan. Look, look [...] well, O Wolves! Ahae! my heart is heavy with the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand.|$|E
6000|$|Hideous as {{is really}} the time that has elapsed since I last held any {{communication}} with you (on that torrid July 3d, p.m., in Kirkland St.--I won't name the year!) it has seemed to me extraordinarily brief and has in fact passed like a flash! Measured by the calendar it's incredible--measured by my sense {{of the way the}} months whizz by (more and more like the telegraph-posts at the window of the train,) it has been a simple good [...] "run" [...] from the eve of my leaving America to the present moment. I came straight back here--to a great monotony and regularity and tranquillity of life (on the whole,) and haven't had really (and shouldn't have, didn't I begin to count!) any of the conscious desolation of having drifted away from you. However, beginning to count makes it another and rather horrible matter--or would make it so if you and I ever counted (in the dreary way of [...] "times" [...] of writing,) or ever had, or ever will. At the same time I yearn to hear from you, and it may increase my chance of that boon if I tell you with all urgency how much I do. On that side, though you, through your habitual magnanimity, won't [...] "mind" [...] my long silence unduly, I mind it myself, with this very first word of my breaking it. Because I'm talking with you now again, and that brings back so many, too many things; and to do so seems the pleasantest and dearest and most natural thing in the world. I leave this place tomorrow for Paris--that is sleep at Dover--but {{an hour and a half}} hence--and go farther the next day; which is the first time I've stirred (except for an occasional week in London) since I last stirred out of sight of you. I've been for a long time under the promise of going over to see William's Bill, who is working tooth and nail, to every appearance, at Julian's studio-- ...If I can I shall dash down to Italy--to Florence and Venice--for a short spell before restoration--to this domicile--the last time, I daresay, that I shall ever brave the distinctly enfeebled spell (as I last felt it to be--seven years ago) of those places; so utterly the prey of the Barbarian now that if you still ever yearn for them take an easy comfort and thank your stars that you knew them in the less blighted and dishonoured time. It is very singular to me, living here (in this comparatively old-world corner which has nothing else but its own little immemorial blots and vulgarisms--besides all its great merits) to find myself plunged into the strain of the rankest and most promiscuous actuality as soon as, crossing to the Continent, I direct myself to the shrines of a superior antiquity. One is so out of the stream here that one almost wholly forgets it--and then it is incongruously the most sacred pilgrimages that most vociferously remind one--because (to put it as gracefully as possible) most cosmopolitanly. [...] "Left to myself" [...] I really think I should scarce ever budge from here again--unless to go back to the U.S., which, honestly, I should like almost as much as I should (in some connections--the [...] "travelling" [...] above all) dread it. But the dread wouldn't be the same dread of the American-Anglican and German Italy. These will strike you as cheerful sentiments for the eve of a pleasure-trip abroad, and I shall feel better when I've started; but even so the travel-impulse (which I've had almost no opportunity in my life really to gratify) is extinct as from inanition (and personal antiquity!) and above all, more and more, the only way I care to travel is by reading. To stay at home and read is more and more my ideal--and it's one that you have beautifully realized. I think it was the sense of all that it has so admirably done for you that confirmed me while I was with you in my high estimation of it. Great, every way, dear Grace, and all-exemplary, I thought the dignity and coherency and benignity of your life--long after beholding it as it has taken me (by the tiresome calendar again!) to make you this declaration. I at any rate have the greatest satisfaction in the thought--the fireside vision--of your still and always nobly leading it. I don't know, and how should I? much about you in detail--but I think I have a kind of instinct of how the side-brush of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> get in a general way a reverberation of touches and affects you, and as in one way or another there seems to have been plenty of the stress and strain and pain of life on the circumference (and even some of it at the centre, as it were) of your circle, I've not been without feeling (and responding to,) I boldly say, some of your vibrations. I hope at least the most acute of them have proceeded from causes presenting for you--well, what shall I say?--an interest!! Even the most worrying businesses often have one--but there are sides of them that we could discover in talk over the fire but that I don't appeal to you lucidly to portray to me. Besides, I can imagine them exquisitely--as well as where they fail of that beguilement, and believe me, therefore, I am living with you, as I write, quite as much as if I made out--as I used to--by your pharos-looking lamplight through your ample and lucid window-pane, that you were sitting [...] "in," [...] as they say here, and were thereupon planning an immediate invasion. I have given intense ear to every breath of indication about Charles and his condition, and in particular to the appearance that, so far as I understand, he has been presiding and dignifying, as he alone remains to have done, the Longfellow centenary--a symptom, as it has seemed to me, of very handsome vitality....|$|E
