5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> become a full-time career. He said {{it was a way to}} make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E

5|$|Haakon's councillors {{had sought}} to {{reconcile}} Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage between Haakon and Skule's daughter Margrete in 1219. Haakon accepted the proposal (although he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete {{did not take place}} before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Ribbung. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempts of settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and spent a great amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed, according to the saga by intrigues derived from rumours and slander by men who played the two against each other. Skule was the first person ever in Norway to be titled Duke (hertug) in 1237, but instead of control over a region gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the syssels scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule's power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he could not stand up to Haakon's forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway's civil war era.|$|E
25|$|Cross {{initially}} rebuffed {{efforts by}} the justices {{to ask about the}} issue still being argued by Soler, that the other statutory claims were non-arbitrable as well. He declined initially, reminding them that the two lower courts had held otherwise. After he was reminded that they were still making the argument, he said that he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be applicable to their specific claims.|$|E
25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, you see that they have come out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a pity to disappoint them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E

500|$|Hopkins {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). [...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been a very interesting thing though. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E

500|$|... spawned two sequels: [...] (1991) and [...] (1994). Naked Gun 2½ grossed {{more than}} the original, with $86.9 million, while Naked Gun 33⅓ grossed $51.1 million. Nielsen {{remained}} open to a fourth Naked Gun film, although he doubted {{that it would be}} produced — [...] "I don't think so", he said in 2005. [...] "If there hasn't been one by now, I doubt it. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|Fox {{had said}} of St Vincent's {{appointment}} in 1801 [...] "allow me to say, that I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easy, if possible, {{to find a}} man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person {{at the head of the}} Admiralty– I mean the Earl of St Vincent." [...] and had continued his support of the Earl throughout his time as first lord.|$|E
500|$|Finch, as {{the head}} of New Scotland Yard and Minister of Investigations (the [...] "Nose"), is the lead {{inspector}} in the V investigation, who, during his investigation, uncovers an unspeakable government crime. When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film, Rea replied [...] "Well, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be very interesting if it was just comic-book stuff. The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of course I was interested in the politics. Why wouldn't I be?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{letter is}} written {{to a man}} named Gaius. [...] Gaius {{seems to have been}} a wealthy man, since the epistle's author, who {{identifies}} himself only as [...] "the Elder", did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> impose unduly on him to host some traveling preachers for a short time. The Elder may have converted Gaius, since he calls Gaius his [...] "child" [...] in the faith. [...] The Apostolic Constitutions VII.46.9 records that Gaius was made bishop of Pergamon, though there is no early support for this statement.|$|E
500|$|I'm a good storyteller and I wrote a good outline {{and a good}} script. And if {{they had}} done it right and {{if it had been}} {{directed}} by somebody who knew how to direct, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been an excellent movie. Jaws 3-D was the only thing Joe Alves ever directed; the man is a very skilled production designer, but as a director, no. And the so-called 3D just made the film look murky [...] – it had no effect whatsoever. It was a waste of time.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles police stated Hartman's {{death was}} caused by a [...] "domestic discord" [...] between the couple. A friend stated that Brynn {{allegedly}} [...] "had trouble controlling her anger [...] She got attention by losing her temper". A neighbour of the Hartmans told a CNN reporter that the couple had been experiencing marital problems: [...] "It's been building, but I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lead to this", and actor Steve Guttenberg said they had been [...] "a very happy couple, and they always had the appearance of being well-balanced." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is on {{the western}} coast of Greenland, about four hundred and fifty miles below Upernivik. It is {{not much of a}} place, but Captain Williamson <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be unwise to attempt to reach Upernivik in our present condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--she is in bed; but she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{a comfort}} to her. She has seen nobody these four days except Mr. Martin, and she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> comfort {{her to have}} {{a word or two}} with Mr. Gibson." [...] Now Mr. Gibson was not only going to be Bella's brother-in-law, but he was also a clergyman. Camilla in her heart {{believed}} that the half-clerical aspect which her mother had given to the request was false and hypocritical. There were special reasons why Bella should not have wished to see Mr. Gibson in her bedroom, at any rate till Mr. Gibson had become her brother-in-law. The expression of such a wish at the present moment was almost indecent.|$|R
50|$|When {{she wakes}} {{the morning before}} the dance, she notices that she is {{virtually}} hairless, and cries while being embraced by her mother. Sarabeth <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a mistake for her boyfriend {{to take her to}} the prom in this condition.|$|R
500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as {{a continuation of the}} Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and when I got to the end I wrote mine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Well, I don't want to jinx it, but I'm {{pretty sure}} it's the best episode, {{and maybe not}} just of this show but of any show on {{television}} ever, any theater show, any staged show, movie, or any, like, campfire ritual performed by cavemen. Take {{it all the way}} back. I {{think this is going to}} be the thing everyone talks about for the rest of their lives, and it will live on in infamy and history. If aliens came down and wanted one artifact to learn about human life, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be this episode of Parks and Recreation. And you can take that to the bank." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the game, the Miller {{brothers}} eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a detriment to always, {{for the rest of our}} lives, be creating Myst-like projects. [...] We're going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner." [...] Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's , which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels.|$|E
