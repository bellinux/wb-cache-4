5000|$|The {{transaction}} {{made the}} prime minister the target of accusations that he was selling an asset of national importance to a foreign entity, and hence selling out his nation. The Democrat Party spokesman called Thaksin worse than Saddam for not protecting the Thai economy from foreigners: [...] "Dictator Saddam, though a brutal tyrant, still fought the superpower for the Iraqi motherland." [...] Supporters, however, counter that Thailand's mobile phone industry is highly competitive, and that little criticism was raised when the Norwegian firm Telenor acquired <b>Total</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Communications,</b> the country's second largest operator. Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva had criticised Thaksin earlier for not sufficiently opening up the Thai telecom sector to foreigners. Supporters further counter that the complete sale of Shin Corporation by the Shinawatra-Damapong families had been a long-standing demand of some public groups, as it would allow Thaksin to undertake his duties as prime minister without accusation of conflicts of interest.|$|E
