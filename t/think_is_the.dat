During an interview with MTV News in June, Lee talked about the song saying, [...] " [...] the song that I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first single is the song that wraps it all up. It's got a cool meaning, {{a lot of great}} lyrics going on, it also just smacks you right in the face and it's heavy and it's great." [...] She noted that the song was a departure from the band's previous material and acknowledged that they wanted the new single to be [...] "more than a hit".|$|E
500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy. He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever number you <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, {{the sky and the}} celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast of Voyager found the episode enjoyable. Mulgrew praised [...] "Elogium" [...] for her {{opportunity}} {{to interact with the}} Kes character on a maternal level. [...] Mulgrew thought the episode was a great vessel for Lien to stretch her acting chops, calling her [...] "a constant and wonderful surprise." [...] Lien herself thought that the episode was a great vehicle to learn more about her character and the Ocampa species; she said [...] "t really took my character to a different level." [...] Russ thought that [...] "Elogium" [...] (along with [...] "Emanations") were stories that challenged concepts, ideas, attitudes, and traditions—all things that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry originally wrote science fiction about: [...] "That, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most important part of Star Trek." [...] Director Winrich Kolbe praised Lien's performance in [...] "Elogium", but was disappointed that he could not take the character even further, saying that [...] "he show went soft at the end." [...] Kolbe complained that it wasn't uncommon for a wonderful concept to fall victim to a failing of courage and determination.|$|E

500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonny Takhar, {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. [...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans." [...] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, [...] "which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans," [...] according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian. One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E

2500|$|When {{he retired}} in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, [...] "I'm going out telling the story that I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a {{partisan}} propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The God Delusion" [...] {{explores the}} {{unproven}} beliefs that {{are treated as}} factual by many religions and the extremes to which some followers have taken them.

[...] Dawkins argues that [...] "the process of non-thinking called faith" [...] is not a way of understanding the world, but instead stands in fundamental opposition to modern science and the scientific method, and is divisive and dangerous.|$|E

2500|$|Gregory {{was among}} those who {{identified}} Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany, whom [...] recounts as having anointed Jesus with precious ointment, an event that some interpret as being the same as the anointing of Jesus performed by a woman that Luke (alone among the synoptic Gospels) recounts as sinful. Preaching on the passage in the Gospel of Luke, Gregory remarked: [...] "This woman, whom Luke calls a sinner and John calls Mary, I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mary from whom Mark reports that seven demons were cast out." [...] Today Biblical scholars distinguish the three figures, but they are all still popularly identified.|$|E
2500|$|Charles V of France resumed {{hostilities}} when Prince Edward {{refused a}} summons as Duke of Aquitaine and his reign saw the Plantagenets steadily pushed back in France.

After the town had opened its gates to John, Duke of Berry, he directed the massacre of 3,000 inhabitants, men, women and children. Following this the prince was too ill {{to contribute to the}} war or government and returned to England where he soon died: the son of a king and the father of a king, but never a king himself.|$|E

2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to what you <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right size." ...|$|E
2500|$|This most {{eccentric}} and haunting {{of modern}} epics {{is driven by}} oilman Daniel Plainview, who, {{in the hands of}} actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> performance of the new century—There Will Be Blood stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism.
