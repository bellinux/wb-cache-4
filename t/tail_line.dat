40|$|When a Property and Casualty (P&C) {{insurance}} company becomes insolvent, solvent {{insurance companies are}} forced to pay assessments (a form of taxation) to state guarantee funds ('solvency funds') {{in order to protect}} the policyholders of the failed companies. We produce estimates of the costs to the guarantee funds of resolving P&C {{insurance company}} insolvencies. We find that the total net costs (payments by the fund less recoveries by the fund) of resolving insolvencies are remarkably high. We estimate that the mean ratio of net costs to assets is approximately one, implying that insolvent companies have liabilities that are roughly twice as large as assets when they fail. Our cost estimate for resolving insurance company insolvencies is roughly three times higher than similar estimates for banks. We also find that the ratio of net costs to assets tends to be higher for small firms, poorly capitalized firms, firms writing significant premiums in long <b>tail</b> <b>lines,</b> and firms that fail because of disasters. Our findings also indicate that the resolution of insolvencies is typically quick. More than 60 percent of all costs to the fund for a given insolvency occur within two years, and more than three-quarters of total costs occur within three years. However, we find that firms with a high proportion of premiums in long <b>tail</b> <b>lines</b> take much longer to resolve. ...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 125 The cost of high {{pressure}} gland water and increasing environmental concerns {{have made the}} use of flushless mechanical seals attractive in many slurry applications. One such application exists at Syncrude Canada Lts (SCL). SCL is a large scale mining operation that extracts crude oil from tar sand. The by product of the process, 150 degrees F sand and water tailings, is pumped to remove storage sites. Tailings pumps are staged in series {{to reduce the number}} of pump stations. As a result, <b>tailing</b> <b>line</b> pressures can reach 300 psig. Recently, SCL expanded their tailings storage by adding a new remote site. Due to the high cost of installing and maintaining a gland water line, the decision was made to use flushless mechanical seals in place of packing. At the time of the expansion a large slurry seal capable of handling the {{high pressure}} tailings was not available; however, one seal manufacturer had a prototype seal design that had potential. This seal was chosen with the thought that it could be developed and refined to provide consistent 200 hr life. Having made the decision to use mechanical seals, the pipeline system was designed with the mechanical seal requirements in mind. Shortly after startup of the new <b>tailing</b> <b>lines,</b> seals began to fail. With the line now in operation, it was necessary to quickly resolve the problems. An intensive effort was launched to determine why seals were failing. Initial investigation showed the process, controls, and new equipment were working properly. The failures appeared to be seal relation. Over the next months, joint work conducted by SCL and the seal manufacturer identified a range of seal problems and interim measures were implemented to increase seal life. As a result of this work, an improved seal design was achieved. Extensive lab and field testing of the improved seal has proved its performance in this aggressive service. Active seals now average 3000 hr, with some seals having a life of over 6000 hr...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of classical Be stars, stars that show emission lines {{due to a}} disk-like structure around the central object, has been recognize {{for more than one}} century. In contrast the history of the B[e] stars is much shorter. Conti suggested calling B-type stars that show low ionization forbidden emission lines as B[e]. Nowadays, we know that B[e] stars are an inhomogeneous group of objects so it is uncorrect to speak about a class of stars but it is better to talk about the B[e] phenomenon. The B[e] phenomenon appears in early-type emission lines stars with low-excitation lines, forbidden lines, and hot dust detected by an IR excess. The phenomenon is important because appears in very different evolutionary stages of stars (in the intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars HAeB[e], in the main sequence stars MSB[e], in the evolved high-mass stars sgB[e], evolved low-mass stars cPNB[e], symbiotic stars symB[e] etc.). Studying this phenomenon we can better understand the physical mechanisms that appear during the life of a star and correlations between dynamical mechanisms (wind, rotation, eruptions, non radial pulsations, binarity etc.) and evolution. It is important that B[e] objects harbor dust in a circumstellar disk and may be responsible for at least few percent of the Galactic circumstellar dust. Dust forming B[e] stars exist in the lower metallicity environments of LMC and SMC so it is reasonable to suggest that they might have been important dust producers in the earlier Universe. It is difficult to study these stars beacause they are embedded in a geometrically and optically thick circumstellar envelope, but, we can try to infer the physical properties by studying the interaction between the star and its environment. The object of my analysis is IRAS 17449 + 2320, it is a 10 mag B[e] object situated in the Hercules constellation at a distance of 700 pc from the Sun. IRAS 17449 + 2320 is catalogued as a A 0 V star and a possible FS CMa object, a subclass of the B[e] phenomenon. There are observational and physical criteria for the identification of a FS CMa star. Observational criteria: - Emission line spectra contain H lines stronger than in Be, HAeBe, and normal supergiants; Fe II and [O I]; sometimes [Fe II] and weak [O III] lines. -Large IR excess that peaks at 10 - 30 micrometer and sharply decreases longward. -Location outside of star forming regions. -When presents, a secondary companion (i) is typically fainter and cooler (if it is a normal star) than the primary or (ii) is degenerate. Physical criteria: -T_eff of the hot star/companion of about 9000 - 30000 K (O 9 - A 2 type stars). -Luminosity of the hot star/companion log (L/L_sun) approx 2. 5 - 4. 5 V_pri -V_sec > 2 mag This is an observational thesis, so a special focus is on the data analysis. I will explain how to reduce spectral data, both slit and échelle, with IRAF software, then I will analyze the spectra taken from the Ondrejov Observatory, the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir, McDonald Observatory and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope. In particular, I will analyze line profile variations, expecially for the Balmer lines. Then, theoretical chapters follow, trying to describe the phenomenology behind the physical mechanisms inferred by the spectroscopic studies. The Balmer lines have broad wings in absorption wide 3600 km/s (FWZI) but the core is composite by emission and absorption features. The variation of Balmer lines is only in the core and in the range of velocity of [- 300, 300] km/s, this means that the dynamical phenomena that are affecting these lines are playing at a distance lesser than an AU. The wings of Fe II, Na I D, O I and Ca II are broad as the range of velocity where the dynamical phenomena are affecting the Balmer lines. This can suggest that these lines are forming in the same region of the perturbations. Instead the width of [O I] emission lines suggest that [O I] are forming in a wider low density region and it is possible to use the doppler shift of these lines as an indicator of the radial velocity of the system that is RV=(- 16 ± 2) km/s. I found in the Balmer lines, the presence of composite absorption features moving from the blue to the red side with a time scale of few days, changing their velocity of 200 km/s. This behaviour be explained by the presence of coherent but temporary structures that are orbiting around the star at about 0. 2 AU where the radiation has a temperature of about approx 2900 K. The origin of this structure is not known, but some scenarios are the presence of global one-armed (i. e. azimuthal wave number m = 1) oscillations in the equatorial discs and the evaporation of a planet forming a multi-cometary <b>tail.</b> <b>Line</b> variations are found on a range of timescales: few days for Balmer lines, and month or years for the other lines. The presence of He I lines suggests that the star is earlier than thought by Miroshnichenko but not earlier than a B 8 V. The wings of Balmer lines compared with the ones obtained rotating the spectrum of Vega gives an estimation of the projected rotational velocity. The best match is assuming v_eq sin(theta) approx 200 km/s, hence the star is a fast rotator. FS CMa objects sometimes show binarity, in this case there is no clear evidence of a companion but binarity cannot be ruled out since a brown dwarf or a white dwarf do not produce detectable spectra...|$|E

5000|$|An amphiphile (from the Greek αμφις, amphis: {{both and}} φιλíα, philia: love, friendship) {{is a term}} {{describing}} a chemical compound possessing both hydrophilic (water-loving, polar) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties. The phospholipid head contains a negatively charged phosphate group and glycerol; it is hydrophilic (attracted to water). The phospholipid tails usually consists of 2 long fatty acid chains; they are hydrophobic and are repelled by water. When placed in water, phospholipids form a variety of structures depending on the specific properties of the phospholipid with tails typically aggregating to minimize interactions with water molecules. These specific properties allow phospholipids {{to play an important}} role in the phospholipid bilayer.
