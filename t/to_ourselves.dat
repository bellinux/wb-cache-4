5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward <b>to</b> <b>ourselves</b> from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at the best of times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E

25|$|Archetypes {{abound in}} {{contemporary}} films and literature {{as they have}} in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct.

25|$|We {{are able}} to {{apprehend}} and represent nature <b>to</b> <b>ourselves</b> in the successive forms which its development assumes {{since it is the}} same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E
25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true <b>to</b> <b>ourselves.</b> I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E

[...] She explores her early career as a nightclub performer. [...] She writes about African art and [...] "the importance of understanding both the historical truth of the African American experience and the art that truth inspired". [...] She salutes Black women, calling them [...] "precious jewels all", and profiles her friend Oprah Winfrey, who she compares to [...] "the desperate traveler who teaches us the most profound lesson and affords us the most exquisite skills". [...] Angelou defends her controversial support of Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court justice in one of her essays. [...] In her final essay in the book, Angelou uses the story of the prodigal son to emphasize the value of solitude: [...] "In the silence we listen <b>to</b> <b>ourselves.</b> [...] Then we ask questions of ourselves.

I describe how we naturally learn from near-peer role models and how it may take a little work <b>to</b> get <b>ourselves</b> out of our comfort zones in order to model diversity. I argue that we normally position ourselves more toward the comfort of homogeneity, whereas we need <b>to</b> push <b>ourselves</b> <b>to</b> try new things through mixing with diversity, in order to really savor our time on this glorious planet...|$|R
