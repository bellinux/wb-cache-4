25|$|Because the {{existing}} narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta {{had been removed}} many years earlier, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PRRPS was to develop {{an effective means of}} reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remains of the standard gauge line to Marree, which has since been truncated at Leigh Creek {{with the opening of the}} newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek is exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branches off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a draw bridge arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of safe working interfacing with the standard gauge line. Diagram.|$|E
25|$|Häkkinen {{remained}} at McLaren for 1998, partnered by Coulthard. Häkkinen was confident going about <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> World Championship into the season, citing {{the involvement of}} technical director Adrian Newey. The season started off with controversy in Australia when teammate Coulthard let Häkkinen past to win the race. Häkkinen had earlier been called into the pit lane by an engineer by mistake. Coulthard later revealed a pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap {{would be allowed to}} win the race. Despite this, Häkkinen managed to take back-to-back victories by winning the next race in Brazil. He managed to maintain his good form at the Argentine Grand Prix where he finished second, although he retired from the San Marino Grand Prix when his car's gearbox failed. However, Häkkinen managed consecutive victories in the next two rounds, which was followed by a retirement from the race in Canada as his car suffered another gearbox failure.|$|E

Impressed by Tag, Valve hired its creators {{to develop the}} mechanic further and only later decided to include it in Portal 2. Valve's vice-president of marketing said, [...] "the decision to combine their tech with Portal 2 came naturally". Journalists have likened Tag to Narbacular Drop, the DigiPen student project that became Portal. The Repulsion (jumping) and Propulsion (running) gels in Portal 2 originated in Tag. Using the third Tag gel, which allows the character to walk on any coated surface regardless of gravity, gave playtesters motion sickness. It was replaced by Conversion gel, which integrates with the portal mechanic.

Jo Horsburgh, Nine Network Head of Drama, stated that the network was [...] "100 percent committed to bringing Underbelly to the small screen". Des Monaghan, executive producer for Screentime, called the series [...] "one of the most exciting and challenging drama projects ever shot in [...] ". The script took 12months to write, beginning in June 2006, with the main writers, Greg Haddrick, Peter Gawler and Felicity Packard putting together an entire episode themselves before their scripts were edited.

The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Obama campaign was using her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was viewed as a polarizing figure, having both [...] "sharp enmity and deep loyalty" [...] from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since the time of the last election when her husband initially ran for the presidency.

500|$|Early in the {{development}} of XIII, Serah {{was meant to be a}} playable character, but was eventually delegated to a supporting character because of technical issues. Tetsuya Nomura, in an interview, said that he designed Serah's hair so that her silhouette would mirror Lightning's. For XIII-2, the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning's roles, with Serah becoming the game's main protagonist, while Lightning was the object of her quest. Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah's new costume like the [...] "plug suit" [...] outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons. Part of <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game was making Serah more active, but maintaining her femininity, which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon. Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range. Aside from Naora's design, Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah: a black combat outfit titled [...] "Exposure and Defense" [...] (later retitled [...] "Style and Steel"), and a second red-and-white outfit titled [...] "Little Red Riding Hood", meant to be indicative of Serah's change into an adult. After a popular vote, the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012. Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{moved to}} the Los Angeles area, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros. sound stage, {{including}} the interior rooms of Saito's Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built in Malibu beach). The dining room {{was inspired by the}} Nijo Castle built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix of Japanese architecture and Western influences. The production also staged a multi-vehicle car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street. To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. The replica was made from fiberglass molds taken from authentic train parts and then matched in terms of color and design. Also, the car chase was supposed to be set {{in the midst of a}} downpour but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers were forced to set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop water cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where a Ford Econoline van flies off the Schuyler Heim Bridge in slow motion. This sequence was filmed on and off for months with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. Once the van landed in the water, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actors was not to panic. [...] "And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask," [...] explained Cillian Murphy. The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from scuba tanks; underwater buddy breathing is shown in this sequence. Cobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. Limbo was made on location in Los Angeles and Morocco with the beach scene filmed at Palos Verdes beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for Limbo, with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{viability}} of PEM fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability.

The electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the fuel cell stack cost. Although the Pt loading of PEM fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade, further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization. Whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, an alternative is to eliminate the use of Pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of Pt-based technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells, targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-PGM catalyst ORR volumetric activity of 300 A cm−3 ...|$|E

2500|$|The EMDs next {{priority}} is to provide and assist the layperson/caller with pre-arrival instructions to help the victim, using standardized protocols developed in co-operation with local medical directors. Such instructions may consist of simple advice to keep the patient calm and comfortable or to gather additional background information for responding paramedics. [...] The instructions can also frequently become more complex, providing directions over the telephone for an untrained person to perform CPR, for example. [...] Examples of EMDs guiding family members through assisting a loved one {{with the process of}} childbirth prior to the arrival of the ambulance are also quite common. [...] <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> EMD is often the knowledge level of the caller.

2500|$|It {{was through}} Theodore Robinson, {{who was working}} {{alternatively}} in America and France, that he, Twachtman, and Weir kept in close touch with Claude Monet, who was residing in Giverny at the time. The four Americans represented the core of American Impressionism, dedicated to painting what was real for them, what was familiar and close at hand, out-of-doors when possible, and with the immediacy of light and shadow—which though exaggerated and falsely colored at times—makes a purposeful impact or impression. The urban scene provided its own unique atmosphere and light, which Hassam found [...] "capable of the most astounding effects" [...] and as picturesque as any seaside scene. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> urban Impressionist, however, was that activity moved very quickly, and therefore, getting down a complete impression in oil was next to impossible.

Prof [...] He Zuoxiu, who was involved with China's atomic bomb program, has said that plans to expand production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be disastrous, as China was seriously underprepared on the safety front. China's fast-expanding nuclear sector is opting for cheap technology that [...] "will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans", according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. The rush to build new nuclear power plants may [...] "create problems for effective management, operation and regulatory oversight" [...] with the biggest potential bottleneck being human resources – [...] "coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry". <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> government and nuclear companies is to [...] "keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners".
