5|$|After her Navy service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners, who, at least once, chartered her to another shipping company. In May 1922, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon, killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, Iowan ran aground on a reef near Point Conception, California, and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> She was freed from <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> after two weeks, towed to Los Angeles, and repaired.|$|E
5|$|The center's lounge, {{known as}} the Outrigger Room, hosted many local artists over the years. Jazz quintet The Redd Foxx Bbq {{released}} four songs recorded there, and Roscoe Holland recorded a set of eight live performances for his album Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Reef.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Leduc <b>reefs</b> are <b>the</b> same ages as, but not {{contiguous}} with, <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> of <b>the</b> Cairn Formation {{which are}} located farther west. Because <b>the</b> Leduc <b>reefs</b> are nowhere exposed at surface, the extensive outcrops of <b>the</b> Cairn <b>reefs</b> in <b>the</b> Canadian Rockies {{have been studied}} to increase the understanding of <b>the</b> Leduc <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Plans to {{designate}} <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> off Key Largo for a park {{started in the}} 1930s. The state-sanctioned, Everglades National Park Commission proposed a national park for the Everglades, including <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> off Key Largo. Opposition from property owners, outdoors men, and Monroe County Commissioners stopped the plan. When Everglades National Park was created in 1947, the boundaries did not include Key Largo or any of <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Chesterfield <b>Reefs</b> is a loose {{collection}} of elongated reefs that enclose a deep, semi-sheltered, lagoon. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> on <b>the</b> west and northwest {{are known as}} the Chesterfield Reefs; those on the east and north being <b>the</b> Bampton <b>Reefs.</b> <b>The</b> Chesterfield <b>Reefs</b> form a structure measuring 120 km in length (northeast to southwest) and 70 km across (east to west).|$|R
5|$|Bond and Solitaire {{are saved}} when the limpet mine explodes seconds {{before they are}} dragged over the reef: though {{temporarily}} stunned by the explosion and injured on the coral, they are protected from the explosion by <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> and Bond watches as Mr Big, who survived the explosion, is killed by the sharks and barracuda. Quarrel then rescues the couple.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{attributed}} the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered {{that it be}} purified with lime juice, but this had little effect. Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.|$|E
50|$|In the 1860s, beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) and {{pearling}} boats {{began working}} <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> of Torres Strait. An unnamed Frenchman and an operator named Colin Thomson {{are believed to}} have harvested <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> surrounding Poruma in the 1860s.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> are at {{risk from}} {{trawling}} and other human activities that disturb the seabed. For example, in the Wadden Sea, trawling for pink shrimp (Pandalus montagui) [...] broke up <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> and destroyed <b>the</b> fishery as well.|$|R
5000|$|Once <b>the</b> sail is <b>reefed,</b> raise <b>the</b> main, stow {{the boom}} crutch, raise the jib, and bear off. If <b>the</b> <b>reefing</b> is done while moored or in {{sheltered}} waters, the sail to be reefed {{need not be}} lowered entirely. One crewman must pull <b>the</b> <b>reefing</b> line as another crewman lowers the sail.|$|R
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|Finding Nemo was {{released}} on VHS and DVD on November 4, 2003. The DVD release included an original short film, Exploring <b>the</b> <b>Reef,</b> and the short animated film, Knick Knack (1989). The film was then released on both Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set.|$|E
50|$|A {{perceived}} {{deterioration of}} <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> became a {{concern in the}} 1950s. Early attempts to protect <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> led to <b>the</b> establishment in 1960 of a protected area that became John Pennekamp Coral <b>Reef</b> State Park. <b>The</b> creation of Biscayne National Monument (which later became Biscayne National Park) in 1968 protected {{the northern part of}} <b>the</b> Florida <b>Reef.</b> In 1990 <b>the</b> Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary was established, bringing all of <b>the</b> Florida <b>reef</b> into federal or state protection.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{in-depth}} study of a cluster of cold-water coral <b>reefs,</b> <b>the</b> Fugløy <b>Reefs,</b> found at 70 °N on the Norwegian margin. Combining high resolution seismic reflection data, side-scan sonar, video-images, and oceanographic measurements reveals the geologic, geomorphologic and oceanographic setting in which <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> occur. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> consist mainly of the scleractinian ahermatypic Lophelia pertusa, and exist below the thermocline at water depths between 140 m and 190 m. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> appear as cone-shaped, acoustically transparent features on seismic reflection data, consistently located in places characterized by the availability of hard substrate, high relief, and periodical exposure to high tidal cur-rents (> 30 cm/s). These currents transport water of the Norwegian Atlantic Current to <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> from an area with fluid expulsion-related pockmarks. The spatial relationship between reef and pockmark locations and current directions suggests that seepage of biogenic gas might be a catalyst to reef growth. With a height of more than 40 m some of <b>the</b> Fugløy <b>reefs</b> are among <b>the</b> highest reported from the Norwegian Margin. This indicates highly fa-vourable growth conditions, and conservative estimates indicate a net growth rate for <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> of ~ 5 mm/yr. We expect that cold-water reefs will be found further north along the Barents Sea margin as general awareness on the geophysical signature and appearance of <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> increases, because all known factors involved in reef establishment and growth are within the required intervals also further north...|$|R
50|$|Both Fiji and Tonga {{lay claim}} to <b>the</b> Minerva <b>Reefs,</b> which lie between the two countries. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> {{are said to have}} lain in the fishing grounds of the people of Ono-i-Lau, in Fiji. In 1972, Tonga annexed <b>the</b> <b>reefs,</b> which had not {{formally}} been claimed by any State, but Fiji has not recognised the annexation, and has stated it considers <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> to lie within its territory. In late 2010, Fiji responded to news that Tonga had begun construction of a lighthouse on one reef, by saying Fiji reserved the right to take any means necessary to preserve its territorial integrity.|$|R
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E
5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from <b>the</b> <b>reef,</b> or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{rescued by}} the USS Urania, a Coast Guard vessel {{which is part}} of a group heading to Devil's Reef on February 10, {{following}} up on a lead provided by the FBI. On the way there, wizards on <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> summon powerful tidal waves to destroy the flotilla but Jack kills them. The humanoid fish-men known as Deep Ones launch a mass attack on the Urania and eventually Dagon emerges too. Jack manages to defeat the gigantic demigod, but Urania sinks.|$|E
50|$|Atoll lagoons form as {{coral reefs}} grow upwards while the islands that <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> {{surround}} subside, until eventually only <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> remain above sea level. Unlike the lagoons that form shoreward of fringing reefs, atoll lagoons often contain some deep (>20m) portions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1869 the United States Lighthouse Service {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} <b>the</b> Colchester <b>Reef</b> Lighthouse on Lake Champlain to protect ships from the “Middle Bunch Reef,” comprising <b>the</b> Colchester <b>Reef,</b> <b>the</b> Colchester Shoals, and <b>the</b> Hogback <b>Reef.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> are ribbon-like {{structured}} patch reefs.|$|R
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b> However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis, or sea ginger, is {{a species}} of colonial fire coral with a {{calcareous}} skeleton. It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the tropical west Atlantic Ocean. It shows {{a variety of different}} morphologies depending on its location. It feeds on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> building community and subject to the same threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers.|$|E
5|$|Other watersports {{popular in}} Poole Bay include sailing and surfing, {{and there are}} a number of local schools for the {{beginner}} to learn either sport. Bournemouth has the third largest community of surfers in the UK and in 2009 an artificial surf reef, one of only four in the world, was constructed there. <b>The</b> <b>reef</b> failed to deliver the promised grade 5 wave, suffered a series of delays and ran over budget, finally costing £3.2 million.|$|E
40|$|Permian reefs in Sierra Plomosa, Chihuahua {{are well}} exposed and contain shallow-water faunas {{similar to the}} better-studied rocks of <b>the</b> Permian <b>Reef</b> Complex in Texas and New Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> are dominantly mudstones with {{subordinate}} algal boundstones, packstones, and grainstones. Fusulinids indicate <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> are Late Wolfcampian through at least Early Leonardian. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> are found in complicated juxtaposition to basinal clastic rocks of the Plomosas Formation. Thrusting is clearly responsible for the structural association in the Sierra Santo Domingo at {{the east end of}} the range. Sliding of reefal blocks into adjacent deep water may have occurred. Reefal olistoliths of shallow water origin are embedded in deep marine terrigenous clastics...|$|R
50|$|Along the {{coastline}} of the Red Sea runs a parallel stretch of coral reefs. Jeddah {{is one of}} the few places where a gap in <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> allows large vessels to approach {{the coastline}} directly. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> have proven fatal to many ships through the ages.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> coral <b>reef</b> {{are among}} <b>the</b> World Wildlife Fund's Global 200 ecoregions. <b>The</b> <b>reefs</b> are {{endangered}} by sedimentation and eutrophication, which result from agriculture {{as well as}} fishing.|$|R
5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving a detailed description of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} ship wrecks {{that occurred}} along the southeast coast of Florida from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas was {{a cause for}} concern. Between the late 1840s and the late 1850s, more than 500 ships were wrecked on the Florida Reef. The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on <b>the</b> <b>reef.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are no {{native land}} mammals, {{but there are}} native insects, land crabs, and birds, {{including}} the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. The diversity of <b>the</b> <b>reef</b> marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling.|$|E
50|$|In May 1886 Mining Warden Howard Saint George {{visited the}} {{diggings}} and reported 34 Europeans working <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> and thirty to forty Chinese employed exclusively in alluvial workings and in gardening. There were three gardens principally devoted to maize, {{for which there}} was a ready sale at <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Brian Skoloff of The Christian Science Monitor, [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> vanished, experts say, hunger, {{poverty and}} {{political}} instability could ensue." [...] Since countless sea life depend on <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> for shelter and protection from predators, {{the extinction of}} <b>the</b> <b>reefs</b> would ultimately create a domino effect that would trickle down to the many human societies that depend on those fish for food and livelihood. There has been a 44% decline over the last 20 years in the Florida Keys, and up to 80% in the Caribbean alone.|$|R
50|$|There {{was some}} {{damage to the}} {{underwater}} marine habitat. This included <b>the</b> coral <b>reefs,</b> which suffered particularly at the shallower dive sites, and the fish that inhabit <b>the</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
