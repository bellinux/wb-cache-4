40|$|Abstract] Being in a {{multicultural}} environment or having intercultural interactions will affect how one’s identities are constructed or changed. It {{is important to}} understand about ones identity when we study about language education or multicultural societies. It is equally important to know how people indicate <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> during interactions, although there have not yet been many studies that analyzing this. This paper conceptualizes identity as a plural and unsettled object, and it focuses on how foreign people in Japan indicate <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> during interactions. Two kinds of identities will be analyzed in this study. Narrated identities will be analyzed using the interview data, while enacted identities will be analyzed using the conversational data. It will be clarified that people manage <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> when they indicate them during interactions by hiding, actualizing, or “enacting” <b>their</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore how second-generation young adults with foreign {{background}} understand <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities</b> and how they relate to <b>their</b> national <b>identities.</b> Semi-structured interviews with 7 second-generation young adults with foreign background were conducted. The basis for our analysis was social identity theory, identity theory and previous research. As the result shows, the participants in this study had developed an understanding of <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities</b> in relation to <b>their</b> national <b>identities</b> based on influential factors. The influential factors that elicited these understandings of <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities</b> in relation to <b>their</b> national <b>identities</b> were: influential people and cultural influences. On the basis of these influential factors, it had become easier for some participants to identify themselves more with <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities.</b> However, for other participants, the understanding of <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities</b> did not influence their feelings of belongingness to the host society, which means they have considered themselves to belong to both their ethnic and national identities. For those participants who could not identify themselves with both <b>their</b> ethnic <b>identities</b> and relate to <b>their</b> national <b>identities</b> chose to identify themselves with something else, which in this case religion. ...|$|R

40|$|This study set out {{to explore}} how {{academics}} construct and negotiate <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> within {{the world of the}} academe. Identity construction involves different forms of community participation and identification. Utilising the research methodology of narrative inquiry, this article explores how academics came to see themselves across those communities which were of primary importance to them in the formation of <b>their</b> <b>identities.</b> Through the construction of narratives of experience, their lived and told stories emphasised the diversity of <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> that were negotiated with others within personal, historical and situational contexts. The article will conclude by recognising that the study of academics’ lives from their perspective, in which they actively and socially develop <b>their</b> <b>identities,</b> not only provides a lens through which they can be understood as shifting constructions of identity, but allows them to rethink who they are and have become and what influence power relations have had in promoting or negating their sense of academic self...|$|R

5|$|During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and {{especially}} of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (Més que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile.

Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

30|$|According to Kratz and Reimer (1998), {{fashion is}} filled with {{meanings}} and symbols, through which people can visually {{communicate with one another}} in a rapid and direct manner.

Furthermore, Bennett (2005) states that fashion is one of the channels through which people can most readily give voice to <b>their</b> <b>identities.</b> Beyond words, people can convey themselves through dress and fashion, thus creating <b>their</b> social <b>identity.</b> Fashion’s essential role in providing people with means to build, shape, and communicate <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> is especially prominent in larger metropolitan cities where they “mingle with crowds of strangers and have only fleeting moments to impress them” (Bennett 2005, p 96).|$|R
