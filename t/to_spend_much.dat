5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of the rest of his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E
5|$|William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton (1582-1648), {{sometimes}} numbered as the 6th Earl, inherited Aberdour {{from his}} grandfather in 1606. He was Treasurer of Scotland from 1630–36, {{and a strong}} supporter of the Stewart dynasty during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639-1651). However, he was compelled <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of his fortune in the royal interest, leading him into financial difficulty, and forcing him to sell Dalkeith to the Earl of Buccleuch in 1642. Earl William built the Renaissance east wing at Aberdour, probably around 1635. It was certainly standing in 1647, when an inventory records luxurious furniture, carpets, and tapestries. The walled garden was also built in the 1630s, and improvements made to the terraces. Aberdour was therefore a suitable principal residence for the Earls after the sale of Dalkeith.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} prohibition (on aikido, at least) {{was lifted}} in 1948 {{with the creation}} of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido. He delegated most of the work of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru, and instead chose <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of his time in prayer, meditation, calligraphy and farming. He still travelled extensively to promote aikido, even visiting Hawaii in 1961. He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido: NTV's The Master of Aikido, broadcast in January 1960. Ueshiba maintained links with the Japanese nationalist movement even in later life; his student Kanshu Sunadomari reported that Ueshiba temporarily sheltered Mikami Taku, one of the naval officers involved in the May 15 Incident, at Iwama.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife {{that she was going to}} leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E
5|$|Republican {{president}} Dwight D. Eisenhower convinced John Sherman Cooper, {{a former}} senator and ambassador who was immensely popular in Kentucky, to challenge Wetherby, hoping his {{presence on the}} ticket would aid his own re-election bid. In the Republican primary, voters chose Thruston B. Morton to challenge Clements. With two of his factional enemies as candidates for the Senate, Governor Chandler bolted the party and supported the Republican candidates. Further complicating Clements' campaign {{was the fact that}} Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956, and as majority whip, Clements had <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of his time in Washington, D.C. covering Johnson's duties in the Senate. What time he was in Kentucky was usually devoted to Wetherby's campaign, since the Democrats believed Clements would be re-elected easily while Wetherby faced much stiffer odds. These factors, combined with the landslide of support for Eisenhower, the Republican presidential candidate, contributed to the defeat of both Wetherby and Clements. Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes, while Clements lost to Morton by a margin of 7,000 votes out of more than 1 million that were cast in the election. It was Clements' first defeat for elected office in a career that spanned thirty years.|$|E

[...] Before this time, Nikolaus was {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>much</b> of his time at a hunting lodge called Süttör, built in the same location around 1720 with a design by Anton Erhard Martinelli. The hunting lodge was the nucleus around which Esterháza was built.|$|R

25|$|Later in 1936, Faustina became ill, since speculated to be tuberculosis. She {{was moved}} to the {{sanatorium}} in Prądnik, Kraków.

Hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed {{only once a}} year, likely due to the pain caused by the RSD/CRPS, which {{was caused by the}} plane crashes. He also stored his urine in bottles.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Wayne Thompson departed, and Lynn Spradley, a Dogpatch USA {{veteran of}} 14 years, became GM and managed the park through the 1991 season.

25|$|McCarthy {{completed}} the turnaround {{of the club}} in the 2004–05 season. The Black Cats returned to the Premiership as Football League Championship champions, amassing an impressive 94 points. Life in the Premiership was much tougher for McCarthy though, as he was unable <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> to strengthen the team. After a poor season and with the club 16 points from safety with only 10 games remaining, he was dismissed on 6 March 2006. In an ironic postscript, Sunderland eventually appointed Roy Keane as their next permanent manager.|$|E

25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} normally {{results in}} a reduced bride price. Patai states that bride price to a cousin is usually about half as high as to a nonrelative. Due to the poverty of many families this outlay often requires exceptional effort, and especially because the decision traditionally {{is in the hands}} of the groom's father, these considerations may weigh heavily on the outcome. The bride's family moreover is expected <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> of the bride price on the bride herself, so there is a reduced incentive to gain a higher price by avoiding cousin marriage.|$|E

25|$|Watchdogs {{have accused}} Kaiser of abusing the power {{imbalance}} {{inherent in the}} arbitration system. Kaiser engages in many cases whereas a customer will usually engage in just one and Kaiser can reject any arbitrator unilaterally, thus they can select company-friendly arbitrators over those that rule in favor of customers. As a large organization, Kaiser can also afford <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> more on lawyers and orators than the customer, giving them more advantages. In response to criticisms, Kaiser established an Office of Independent Administrators (OIA) in 1999 to oversee the arbitration process. The degree to which this office is actually independent has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|Despite the casualties, Aylmer {{could not}} afford <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>much</b> time waiting {{for the arrival of}} the second {{division}} of reinforcements still working its way upriver to the front. Every advance he made, put him further from his supply base at Basra, and closer to the Ottoman logistical hub at Baghdad. Although considered a British victory (albeit a costly one), the Ottoman forces had achieved their goal in delaying the Tigris Corps. They had bloodied Aylmer's forces, using up time which the Kut garrison believed it did not have and reinforcements which were hard for the British and Indian governments to replace.|$|E
