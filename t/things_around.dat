Her work, which was created by Spanish artisans Alcalagres, consists of blue, violet, and lavender landscapes, as well as depictions of wind blowing <b>things</b> <b>around.</b> The artwork is located on the 4,300 porcelain wall panels of the station. The installation is permanent.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} <b>things</b> <b>around</b> in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of <b>things</b> <b>around</b> the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The England {{side was}} {{thoroughly}} shaken-up following the debacle in the Third Test at Old Trafford. The selectors {{tried to turn}} <b>things</b> <b>around</b> with seven new faces in the team, the most extensive change of an England XI during a Test series since seven players were changed for the 1921 Ashes Tests against Australia at Lord's and Headingley (when only JWHT Douglas, Ciss Parkin, Lionel Tennyson and Frank Woolley were retained, and Tennyson replaced Douglas as captain). As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, the selectors also dropped Paul Downton, Martyn Moxon, Mike Gatting, David Capel, Phil Defreitas and John Childs in favour of Derek Pringle, Neil Foster, Bill Athey, and Jack Richards, with Tim Curtis and Robin Smith making their Test debuts. For the West Indies, both Greenidge and Richardson sat the match out, injured: Haynes returned, and a debut was handed to Keith Arthurton. Jeff Dujon was promoted up the batting order as a makeshift opener.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} appeared {{less frequently}} after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became {{editor of the}} Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, {{in which he was}} played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn <b>things</b> <b>around,</b> moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.|$|E

He {{had to learn}} to control his adventurous shot-making and integrate percentage tennis into his game when he turned professional.

Laver had a strong record in five-set-matches, often turning <b>things</b> <b>around</b> with subtle changes of tactics.|$|E

50|$|Before Weber, {{race and}} {{ethnicity}} were primarily seen as two aspects of the same <b>thing.</b> <b>Around</b> 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies. With Weber's introduction of the view of ethnicity as a social construct, {{race and ethnicity}} became more divided from each other.|$|R

25|$|The Greys {{were part}} of the Central Junior B league {{throughout}} the 1960s.

They lost a semifinal playoff series to the Collingwood Blues, who {{went on to win the}} final over the Guelph CMC's, and thus began a great hockey rivalry that lasted into the 1980s and spanned four different leagues.|$|E
25|$|After {{a loss to}} the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets {{dropped to}} a disappointing 9–19 record.

However, the Nets were able to turn <b>things</b> <b>around</b> at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44-38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.|$|E

25|$|Gibson's bid {{to freshen}} the {{team up with}} younger players failed to improve things as Park endured another woeful {{campaign}} in which they managed only one win in eighteen prior to the final month of the First Division season. With back-to-back relegation looking imminent, they finally turned <b>things</b> <b>around</b> in remarkable fashion as they won their remaining four games {{to pull off the}} Great Escape.

The 76ers faced the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.|$|E

25|$|England turned <b>things</b> <b>around</b> against Australia A as the {{tourists}} piled on the runs. Australia A were luckless {{in the field}} as England's captain, Alastair Cook and Michael Carberry both made 150 each as England ended Day 1 on 0-318. The rain was relentless on Days 2 and 3, no play was possible and the game was headed for a certain draw after which both Cook and Carberry retired. On Day 4, Joe Root made 58 and Ben Cutting was the pick of the bowlers. England finally put Australia A out of their misery and declared at 7-430. Only 31 overs were bowled as Alex Doolan made 31 as another tour match went down as a draw.|$|E
25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn <b>things</b> <b>around...</b> The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E
25|$|Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein {{shook up}} {{the team at}} the MLB trading {{deadline}} July 31, trading the team's wildly popular yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, to the Chicago Cubs, receiving Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles Dodgers for center fielder Dave Roberts. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the line up, the club turned <b>things</b> <b>around,</b> winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.|$|E
