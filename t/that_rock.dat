5|$|The genre has {{received}} both {{a great amount}} of critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók. This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop music, insulted critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics and its shunning of rock's blues roots were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music. Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> and maturity were mutually exclusive. Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{moves into}} {{crystallography}} and mineralogy, describing the octahedral {{shape of the}} diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} of chlorine, sodium chloride, {{has been known}} since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Its importance in food was very well known in classical antiquity and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 {{with the discovery of}} aqua regia and its ability to dissolve gold, since chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a new substance. Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.|$|E

25|$|Rock {{music has}} been {{performed}} and heard in Lithuania since the mid-1960s.

As pressure eased somewhat, rock musicals began to be released, such as Velnio nuotaka ('The Devil's Bride') and Ugnies medžioklė su varovais.|$|E

25|$|Lehman's {{classification}} {{was developed}} by Abraham Gottlob Werner who thought <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood, a doctrine called Neptunism. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by Nicolas Desmarest, whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build up. The fact that these layers were still intact indicated that any later Flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, James Hutton proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{during a}} visit to Geraldton, Lieutenant Commander M.R. Bromell of the Royal Australian Navy learned <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> lobster {{fisherman}} Bill Newbold had found a cannon on the sea-bed, and during a subsequent visit, Bromell located a cannon on the leeward side of the Half Moon Reef. After an elephant tusk found two years earlier put him on the trail, in March 1968 journalist and diver Hugh Edwards led divers Max Cramer, Neil McLaghlan and Museum staff Harry Bingham and Dr Colin Jack-Hinton to the seaward side of the reef to find the main wreck site. The Western Australian Museum subsequently conducted several expeditions to survey the site and to recover artefacts, the most notable in 1976 by Catharina Ingleman-Sundberg, who also completed a catalogue of all the finds from the site.|$|E
25|$|When William Smith and Sir Charles Lyell first {{recognized}} <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> strata represented successive time periods, {{time scales}} could be estimated only very imprecisely since estimates of rates of change were uncertain. While creationists had been proposing dates of around {{six or seven}} thousand years for the age of Earth based on the Bible, early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods, and some were even suggesting a virtually infinite age for Earth. Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils, and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and lithification. Until the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 {{and the development of}} its geological applications through radiometric dating {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, the ages of various rock strata and the age of Earth were the subject of considerable debate.|$|E

25|$|His musical {{career began}} aged 7, {{when he started}} taking piano lessons. He did not enjoy the {{experience}} and after joining Acton County Grammar School aged 11, switched to the trumpet, moving to the French horn {{when he joined the}} Middlesex School's Symphony Orchestra. He met Pete Townshend in the second year of school, and the two formed a trad jazz band, the Confederates. The group only played one gig together, before they decided <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> 'n' roll was a more attractive prospect. Entwistle, in particular, was having difficulty hearing his trumpet with bands, and decided to switch to playing guitar, but due to his large fingers, and also his fondness for the low guitar tones of Duane Eddy, he decided to take up the bass guitar instead. He made his own instrument at home, and soon attracted the attention of Roger Daltrey, who had been the year above Entwistle at Acton County, but had since left to work in sheet metal. Daltrey was aware of Entwistle from school, and asked him to join as a bass guitarist for his band, the Detours.|$|E
25|$|The dome's pendentives {{depict the}} Four Evangelists. The {{inscription}} surrounding {{the base of}} the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on <b>that</b> <b>rock</b> I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is {{the same as that of}} St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but that could be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liepāja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix {{aimed to}} provide {{a wide range of}} music to players through {{additional}} content, stating <b>that</b> <b>Rock</b> Band is a music platform for discovering music. The developer released new songs, compatible with both games, through regular weekly downloadable content (DLC). including various singles, artist packs featuring three or more songs from the artists, and full albums. Downloadable songs are compatible with Rock Band and Rock Band 2. A portion of the downloadable song catalog is also compatible with Lego Rock Band, based on the songs' appropriateness for the game's family-friendly content rating. While The Beatles: Rock Band also supports downloadable content, the game does not share such content with the other Rock Band games, nor can it use content from the other Rock Band games. Green Day: Rock Band does not have its own catalog of downloadable content but a select number of songs from the 21st Century Breakdown album were released to the Music Store prior to the game's release. These songs integrate with Green Day: Rock Band, enabling the player to play the complete 21st Century Breakdown album in the game. Downloadable content released on or after October 26, 2010 is restricted for use with Rock Band 3, Rock Band Blitz, and Rock Band 4 while content released on or after October 6, 2015 is restricted for use with Rock Band 4 only.|$|E
