25|$|The Supreme Muslim Council and {{its head}} al-Husseini, who {{regarded}} himself as guardian {{of one of}} the three holy sites of Islam, launched an international campaign in Muslim countries to gather funds to restore and improve the Haram ash-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) or Temple Mount, and particularly the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the shrine Dome of the Rock (which houses the holiest site in Judaism). The whole area required extensive restoration, given the disrepair into which it had fallen from neglect in Ottoman times. Jerusalem was the original direction towards which Muslims prayed, until the Qibla was reorientated towards Mecca by Mohammed in the year 624.

60|$|Turning now to {{the points}} which more {{immediately}} concern us. Worm- castings were observed on the floors {{of several of the}} rooms, in one of which the <b>tesselation</b> was unusually perfect. The tesserae here consisted of little cubes of hard sandstone of about 1 inch, several of which were loose or projected slightly above the general level. One or occasionally two open worm-burrows were found beneath all the loose tesserae. Worms have also penetrated the old walls of these ruins. A wall, which had just been exposed to view during the excavations then in progress, was examined; it was built of large flints, and was 18 inches in thickness. It appeared sound, but when the soil was removed from beneath, the mortar in the lower part was found to be so much decayed that the flints fell apart from their own weight. Here, {{in the middle of the}} wall, at a depth of 29 inches beneath the old floor and of 49.5 inches beneath the surface of the field, a living worm was found, and the mortar was penetrated by several burrows.|$|E

40|$|In [7] Zinterhof and Zinterhof {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} optimal hyperbolic <b>tesselations</b> of images.

40|$|Regular <b>tesselations</b> {{of space}} are {{characterized}} through their Schlafli symbols {p,q,r}, where each cell has regular p-gonal sides, q meeting at each vertex, and r meeting on each edge. Regular <b>tesselations</b> with symbols {p, 3, 3 } all satisfy Plateau's laws for equilibrium foams. For general p, however, these regular <b>tesselations</b> do not embed in Euclidean space, but require a uniform background curvature. We study {{a class of}} regular foams on S^ 3 which, through conformal, stereographic projection to R^ 3 define irregular cells consistent with Plateau's laws. We analytically characterize a broad classes of bulk foam bubbles, and extend and explain recent observations on foam structure and shape distribution. Our approach also allows us to comment on foam stability by identifying a weak local maximum of A^(3 / 2) /V at the maximally symmetric tetrahedral bubble that participates in T 2 rearrangements.

Using 3D graphics programs or Python code (see external reference link 8 for open source Python code examples vs. NURBS), greater and greater numbers of polygons can be projected {{to and from the}} sphere both for analysis of finite elements, and synthesis of objects and features on the sphere, such as the asteroid ridden planet in the example. In this case, the Lénárt sphere is useful for <b>tesselation</b> (tiling) as a simplification or approximation shortcut to the extremely complex differential math of finite analysis and construction (technically: modeling), especially of animated objects.|$|E

50|$|Texels {{can also}} be {{described}} by image regions that are obtained through a simple procedure such as thresholding. Voronoi <b>tesselation</b> {{can be used to}} define their spatial relationships. This means that a division is made at the half-way point between the centroid of each texel and the centroids of every surrounding texel for the entire texture. The result is that each texel centroid will have a Voronoi polygon surrounding it. This polygon region consists of all points that are closer to its texel centroid than any other centroid.|$|E

50|$|The third type of <b>tesselation</b> {{recognized}} by Branagan {{is associated with}} the shrinkage and cracking of fine-grained, either clayey or calcareous, sediments. They consist of polygonal cracking, often associated with individual 'plates' that tend to be concave upward, that characterizes the formation of mudcracks in fine-grained sediments. Often, the outlines of the polygons formed by this type of cracking are preserved and accentuated by the infilling of the cracks with material of a different composition from that of either the clayey or calcareous sediments in which the cracks form. The infilling of the cracks by sediments of a different character often preserved the polygonal pattern of the cracking where it can be exhumed by erosion as a patterned pavement after the sediment becomes lithified into a sedimentary rock.|$|E
