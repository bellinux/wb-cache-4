Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E

On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> They do what they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E

5000|$|ML, as {{cultural}} association, aims at promoting libertarianism in Italy. The association's motto is [...] "Everyone {{is free to}} do what he <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for himself, without attacking anyone, and without attacking the property rights of others". As such the group organizes meetings, debates and conferences, and issues publications.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, celebrities such as Emma Watson {{have also}} taken a pro-feminist stance through social media. In 2014, the UN Women's Ambassador stated," [...] I am from Britain and <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> {{that as a}} woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that I {{should be able to}} make {{decisions}} about my own body. I <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that women <b>be</b> involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country. I <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights." [...] Her speech also goes into depth about the negative connotation the word feminist has because of social media and how we as a society can take a stand for gender equality.|$|R
2500|$|Jones {{said that}} his father was able to vote his {{conscience}} until he {{became a member of the}} House Democratic leadership, at which time he had to vote with the party line. [...] For instance, his father voted for the 1975 federal bailout of a bankrupt New York City even though he personally opposed it. [...] Jones said of that vote, [...] "He had to vote it that way. I would rather do what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> than to sell my political soul." [...] Jones drifted towards the libertarian spectrum when he changed his positions on foreign policy including the Iraq War.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} 2011 tour saw the band playing {{more of their}} 1980s tracks, the setlist still {{received}} criticism from reviewers, with The Guardian arguing that [...] "lumbering new prog monsters, such as 'When the Wild Wind Blows', pale beside early headbangers 'Running Free' and 'Iron Maiden'." [...] Kerrang! also criticised the set for being [...] "slightly too focussed on their lengthy new material", claiming that this resulted in [...] "alienating some people", although going on to state that they admire the band for [...] "refusing to become the nostalgia act" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "important that they still take these risks." [...] Metal Hammer, on the other hand, praised the band for [...] "not pandering to expectations, sticking to [...] guns and doing what [...] <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> – regardless of peer pressure", claiming that this is [...] "the very spirit of heavy metal." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: [...] "You do what you <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E

50|$|Makoto Sorimachi (Sorimachi Makoto) as Sazer-Gorbion is {{the leader}} of the Water Tribe. His past as a war {{photographer}} made him grow cautious and mistrusting, and initially he does not trust anyone but his tribe members.
