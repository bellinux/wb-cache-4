25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access}} to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
500|$|Lu said of {{his role}} as {{legislative}} director, [...] "It's {{one of the most}} fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job because you have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ...

[...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, I really had fun making this record, and I thought it might interest you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> each song. After all, I wouldn't {{want to be a}} chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E

500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the {{character}} was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd). Shortly after, {{the details of the}} argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. [...] "I was under no delusions," [...] Knight said at the time. [...] "My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, you want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became important to make the statement." [...] The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his [...] "unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set".|$|E
2500|$|The {{change in}} Popular Science Monthly was dramatic. The old version was a {{scholarly}} journal that had {{eight to ten}} articles in a 100-page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaempffert was writing for [...] "the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the world of science." [...] The circulation doubled in the first year.|$|E
2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E

2500|$|Paul advocates {{substantially}} {{reducing the}} government's role in individual lives {{and in the}} functions of foreign and domestic states; he says Republicans have lost their commitment to limited government and have become the party of big government. In the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary, Paul cited President Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address warnings about the growing presence and strength of the [...] "military-industrial complex". His 2012 [...] "Plan to Restore America" [...] would eliminate five Cabinet-level departments: Energy, HUD, Commerce, Interior, and Education. [...] He has called for elimination of other federal {{agencies such as the}} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service, calling them [...] "unnecessary bureaucracies". Paul would severely reduce the role of the Central Intelligence Agency; reducing its functions to intelligence-gathering. He would eliminate operations like overthrowing foreign governments and assassinations. He says this activity is kept secret even from Congress and [...] "leads to trouble". He also commented, [...] "We have every right in the world <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> intelligence gathering, but we have to have intelligent people interpreting this information." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Manga Life, Ryan Lewis {{described}} Kaze Hikaru as [...] "a unique title", praising its [...] "engaging" [...] story, {{plot and}} characters. Comics Village's Lori Henderson described the manga as [...] "an enjoyable read", {{and said it}} is interesting because it shows the history and culture during the Shogunate. It was elected one of the [...] "Most Underrated" [...] manga along with [...] and Saturn Apartments; Eva Volin stated that despite the necessity for the reader <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that period of Japanese history, the reader will [...] "fall in love" [...] with the characters [...] "as they deal {{with the fall of}} the samurai way and the rise of modern warfare". Pop Culture Shock's reviewer Katherine Dacey described Kaze Hikaru as [...] "an action-filled drama in the vein of The Rose of Versailles or They Were Eleven", and she praised the political nature of the series because Watanabe discusses the gender constraints in Japan. Reviewing the ninth volume, Isaac Hale, also from Pop Culture Shock, commended the series for keeping the same humor that it had at the beginning. Hale said the art was a [...] "high point" [...] of the manga; he described the character designs as [...] "attractive and unique" [...] but he criticized the main character's gender indecision. Matthew Alexander from Mania.com appreciated the story's historical setting and the theme of [...] "a woman in a man's world." ...|$|E
