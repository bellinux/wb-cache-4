To do the research, the writer would like {{to make use of the}} qualitative approach.

The findings of the analysis reveal that the mistakes occurring in <b>the</b> <b>subtitles</b> are of two kinds.

This paper is a critical examination of <b>the</b> <b>subtitling</b> process. <b>The</b> film {{that is the subject}} of this paper is Rurouni Kenshin (2012), a film adapted from the previous media of manga and anime. <b>The</b> examination of <b>subtitles</b> was done by selecting four short scenes and creating titles for them in order to answer the question of whether or not analysis and examination of the film caused <b>the</b> <b>subtitles</b> to differ from a basic translation edited to fit within <b>the</b> requirements of <b>subtitles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>subtitles</b> were created for an audience that was familiar either with the Kenshin franchise’s previous incarnations or with the Meiji Restoration and post-Meiji periods in Japan.

5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death.

5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite <b>the</b> <b>subtitle,</b> {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E
40|$|Foreign {{language}} (FL) {{films with}} subtitles {{are becoming increasingly}} popular, and many European countries use subtitling as a cheaper alternative to dubbing.

The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the delay was the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16.

5|$|The Binding Blade was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems. It was directed by Tōru Narihiro, and produced by Takehiro Izushi. The designer was Masayuki Horikawa, while programming was handled by Takafumi Kaneko. The scenario was written by Masayuki Horikawa and series newcomer Kouhei Maeda. The character designs were handled by Eiji Kaneda. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on every title in the series up to that point. The Binding Blade began development as Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, a Fire Emblem title intended for the Nintendo 64 and its peripheral 64DD. This version was revealed in 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto under the working title Fire Emblem 64. When they were well into the development of Maiden of Darkness, the internal development structure at Intelligent Systems was changed, which combined with the poor sales of the 64DD resulted in the game's development being restarted in 2000 for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). Very little of the original Nintendo 64 game concept survived the transition. Aside from the characters Roy and Karel, most of the original game's characters were scrapped. <b>The</b> <b>subtitle</b> Maiden of Darkness remained in use as a working title up until 2001, when it became The Binding Blade.

5|$|The {{concept and}} {{scenario}} draft {{was written by}} Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes {{and turn them into}} a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in subsequent changes to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series; in the context of Episode II, <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> was said to represent the blurring of boundaries between concepts of right and wrong, in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology.|$|E
25|$|Especially in fansubs, <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> {{translator}} may translate both {{form and}} meaning. <b>The</b> <b>subtitle</b> translator may also choose {{to display a}} note in the subtitles, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or as a separate block of on-screen text—this allows <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> translator may leave {{a note on the}} screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness.

Also, <b>the</b> <b>subtitle</b> translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
