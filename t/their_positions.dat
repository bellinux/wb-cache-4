5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members.

Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> only 16% of the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
