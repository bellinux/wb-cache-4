5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E

5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations {{on the line and}} the closure was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these developments, the King immediately orders the conspirators arrested and mobilizes the army at the Bordurian border, which discourages <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> invasion. In thanks, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour.

5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as education secretary on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was spurred by <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At {{the time of his}} departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, {{political}} friction increased {{between the}} Army and the Air Force over the {{close air support}} (CAS) mission. The Air Force asserted that the Cheyenne would infringe on the Air Force's CAS mission {{in support of the}} Army, which had been mandated with the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a study that concluded that the Air Force's A-X program, the Marine Corps' Harrier, and the Cheyenne were significantly different that they did not constitute a duplication of capabilities. On 22 October 1971, the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on Tactical Air Power conducted hearings to evaluate the CAS mission and <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> programs. The most damaging testimony for the Army's program came from the commander of the Air Force's Tactical Air Command, General William W. Momyer, who cited helicopter casualty statistics of Operation Lam Son 719.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the town}} closed the bridge {{as it was}} deemed unsafe and badly deteriorated. It was {{estimated}} that $72,000 {{would be needed to}} relocate the bridge. In February 1999, an eight-member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site. First Selectman Paul Brycki, hoped that <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge. Prior to February 1999, the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed. The bridge was also on the state of Connecticut's historic register list.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. <b>The</b> <b>pending</b> loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|Phantasmagoria {{finished}} 1995 as {{the ninth}} best-selling {{game of the}} year according to an analysis by PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator, Myst and Command & Conquer, and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> release of its sequel , and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling computer software programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than 1 million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Leopold and Wolfgang arrived back in Salzburg {{the court was}} thrown into turmoil {{by the death of}} Archbishop Schrattenbach. This created {{problems}} for Leopold, who had unresolved issues with the court. Part of his salary during the second Italian visit had been stopped, and Leopold wished to petition for its payment, and to pursue the matter of Wolfgang's salary as a Konzertmeister, which Schrattenbach had indicated might be paid on Wolfgang's return from the first Italian journey. There was also the matter of succession to the post of Salzburg's Kapellmeister, to be available soon on <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> retirement of the incumbent, Giuseppe Lolli, who was over 70 years old; Leopold, who had followed Lolli as Vice-Kapellmeister, might normally have felt confident of succeeding him to the higher post. Decisions on these matters would now be made by the new archbishop, whose policies and attitudes were unknown.|$|E
5|$|The scouts were {{pursued by}} the disorganized militia and several were killed. The {{surviving}} scouts arrived at Black Hawk's camp ahead of the militia and reported the events. At the camp, the warriors set up a skirmish line in order to fend off <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> militia attack. The militia soldiers, intent on pursuing the scouts, chased them back toward the main force of Black Hawk's warriors and their skirmish line. Black Hawk and his force concealed themselves and ambushed the pursuers. Believing that thousands of Sauk and Fox were attacking them, the militia panicked and fled {{back to the main}} force camped at Dixon's Ferry. Stillman's exact whereabouts are unknown during this point in the battle. His later account published in a newspaper did not mention his location and noted his only order was to retreat. Stillman's account, published in the Missouri Republican, has been called fanciful.|$|E
5|$|With Phil Jackson's {{contract}} expiring, <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, {{and being}} in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired {{for the second time}} on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.|$|E

5|$|After {{writing a}} {{television}} serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in Ram Gopal Varma's crime drama Satya (1998), {{and made his}} directorial debut with Paanch, which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He {{then went on to}} direct Black Friday (2007), a film based on the book by Hussain Zaidi about the 1993 Bombay bombings. Its release was held up for two years by the Central Board of Film Certification because of <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> verdict of the case at that time, but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's followup, No Smoking (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture Dev.D (2009), a modern adaptation of Devdas was a critical and commercial success; followed by the political drama Gulaal (2009), and the thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011). His prominence increased with the two-part crime drama, Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). His next films were Bombay Talkies (2013), Ugly (2014) and Bombay Velvet (2015). In 2016, Kashyap directed Raman Raghav 2.0, a film based on the serial killer Raman Raghav.|$|E
5|$|Charles VII {{spent most}} of his three-year reign as emperor {{residing}} in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father's electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in <b>the</b> <b>pending</b> imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.|$|E
