25|$|Philip II {{spent much}} of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms formed the basis of Philip's later tactics. The {{equipment}} of the Macedonian phalangite {{is believed to have been}} influenced by the 'peltast' developed by the Athenian general Iphicrates. The Iphicratean peltast was not a skirmisher but a form of light hoplite, characterised by using a longer spear and smaller shield. However, the introduction of the sarissa pike in conjunction with a smaller shield seem to have been innovations devised by Philip himself, or at the very least he produced the definitive synthesis of earlier developments. Diodorus claimed that Philip was inspired <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the organisation of his Macedonian infantry from reading a passage in the writings of Homer describing a close-packed formation.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> their lives such as stopping smoking, {{reducing the amount of}} alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E
