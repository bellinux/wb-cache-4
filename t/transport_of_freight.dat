5|$|Air {{transport}} in the United Kingdom is {{a growth}} industry. In the period 1981 to 2006 {{the number of}} terminal passengers increased by 400 per cent and air transport movements by 250 per cent. Although the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> declined slightly year on year between 2004 and 2006, in the decade since 1996 air freight has increased by 31 per cent. During {{the period in which}} government policy was being formulated the number of passengers exceeded 200million, and in 2006 the industry handled over 236million passengers (up 3 per cent from the previous year), with nearly 2.4million air transport movements (up 1.8 per cent).|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} LMS trunk routes {{were the}} West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line, which linked London, the industrial Midlands and North-West of England, and Scotland. The railway's main business was the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> between these major industrial centres, rather than passengers.|$|E
25|$|Basel's {{airport is}} set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach {{the city and the}} heart of {{continental}} Europe from the North Sea by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, {{the first}} inter-city railway {{in the world}} and was {{attended}} by Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington. The railway was engineered by Joseph Locke and George Stephenson, linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of Manchester with the port town of Liverpool. The opening was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> and commodities, led to Railway Mania.|$|E
25|$|This {{area was}} notorious for highwaymen. In 1736, Stephen Phillips, a robber tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, {{admitted}} to the Newgate chaplain to having stolen 150 guineas in gold on the road towards London. In 1786, three men were convicted {{of the murder of}} an unknown sailor on his way from London to rejoin his ship, a deed commemorated by several memorials in the area. The perpetrators were hung in chains to warn others on Gibbet Hill, a short walk away on top of the Devil's Punch Bowl. With an increase in traffic and opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line removing much of the road <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight,</b> such incidents reduced during the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Air and {{maritime}} transport is developing in Georgia, {{with the former}} mainly used by passengers and the latter for <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight.</b> Georgia currently has four international airports; the largest of which is by far Tbilisi International Airport, hub for Georgian Airways, which offers connections to many large European cities. Other airports {{in the country are}} largely underdeveloped or lack scheduled traffic, although, as of late, efforts have been made to solve both these problems. There are a number of seaports along Georgia's Black Sea coast, the largest and most busy of which is the Port of Batumi; whilst the town is itself a seaside resort, the port is a major cargo terminal in the Caucasus and is often used by neighbouring Azerbaijan as a transit point for making energy deliveries to Europe. Scheduled and chartered passenger ferry services link Georgia with Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.|$|E

500|$|Sheffield's {{transport}} infrastructure was also improved. In the 18th century turnpike roads were built connecting Sheffield with Barnsley, Buxton, Chesterfield, Glossop, Intake, Penistone, Tickhill, and Worksop. In 1774 a [...] wooden tramway was laid at the Duke of Norfolk's Nunnery Colliery. The tramway {{was destroyed by}} rioters, who saw {{it as part of}} a plan to raise the price of coal. A replacement tramway that used L-shaped rails was laid by John Curr in 1776 {{and was one of the}} earliest cast-iron railways. The Sheffield Canal opened in 1819 allowing the large-scale <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight.</b>|$|E
500|$|The deteriorating {{quality of}} roads {{was due to}} bad attendance, and the then ongoing growth in road {{transport}} made it even harder for the Soviet authorities to focus their resources on attendance and maintenance projects. The <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> by road had increased by 4,400 {{percent in the past}} thirty years, while the growth of hardcore surfaced roads had grown only by 300 percent. Growth of motor vehicles had increased by 224 percent in the 1980s, while hardcore surfaced roads only increased by 64 percent. As Soviet economists in the early to mid-1980s said, the Soviet Union had 21 percent of the world's industrial output, but only a meager 7 percent of the world's top quality roads. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85; spanned through the rules of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko) called for the construction of an additional 80,000km hardcore surfaced roads, but this was far from adequate in solving the serious shortage, and the planners needed to build at least twice as many roads to meet consumer demand. Another obstacle was that Five-Year Plans in the USSR's later life were rarely fulfilled due to economic malfunctions. Many roads were not paved, and because of this shortage, several dirt roads were created. By 1975 only 0.8 percent of [...] households owned a car. Productions of cars, however, had increased dramatically in the late 1970s. From 1924 to 1971 the USSR produced 1 million vehicles, and the government passed another milestones five years later when it had produced 2 million vehicles.|$|E
