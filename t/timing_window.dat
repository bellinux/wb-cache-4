Since some green energy sources are intermit-tent and are not always available, we need to dynamically connect distribution networks to the green energy powered data centres. On the other hand, the availability of green energy is reasonably predictable, and we are thus able to schedule connectivity to data centres in advance. We pro-pose a WDM network planning model, which allows light-paths to slide within their desired <b>timing</b> <b>windows</b> with no penalty on the optimization objective, and to slide beyond their desired <b>timing</b> <b>windows</b> with a deteriorating “green-level”.

50|$|By {{assuming}} a Gaussian human response {{time to a}} particular in-game event, it becomes possible to discuss the effect of lag in terms of probabilities. Given a lag-less display, a human has a certain probability to land his/her input within a window of frames. As video games operate on discrete frames, missing the last frame of the window even by 0.1 ms causes an input to be interpreted a full frame later. Because of this, any amount of lag will affect a human's ability to hit a particular <b>timing</b> <b>window.</b> The severity of this impact {{is a function of}} the position and variance of a human's response to a visual cue, the amount of lag introduced, and the size of the <b>timing</b> <b>window.</b> For example, given a very large window of 30 frames, a human would likely have a 99.99% chance of hitting this window. By introducing one frame of lag, the human's ability to hit the 30 frame window would likely remain in the 99.99% range (assuming the human is responding somewhere near the middle of the window). Given a smaller window of say 2 frames, however, the effect of lag becomes much more significant. Assuming the human's response is centered on the 2 frame window and the super-human has a 99.99% chance to hit the window, introducing a full frame of lag causes the success rate to drop all the way to about 50%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — High {{performance}} circuits {{are facing}} increasingly severe signal integrity problems due to crosstalk noise and crosstalk noise awareness {{has become an}} integral part of static timing analysis (STA). Existing crosstalk noise aware STA methods compute noise induced delay uncertainty on a net by net basis and in a pessimistic way, without considering the overlap bounds of the victim and aggressor <b>timing</b> <b>windows</b> and realistic delay impact on early and late signal arrival times. Since crosstalk induced delay on indivudial nets contribute cumulatively on data and clock paths, even small amounts of pessimism in computation can add up to produce several unrealistic timing violations. Unlike glitch noise analysis where noise often attenuates during propagation, quality of delay noise analysis is severely affected by any pessimism in noise estimation and can unnecessarily cost valuable silicon and design resources for fixing unreal violations. In this paper, we propose two temporal techniques to reduce pessimism in crosstalk noise aware STA. The first method, “effective delay noise”, is a net based method where the exact overlap points of victim and aggressor <b>timing</b> <b>windows</b> are considered to obtain the part of delay noise that actually impacts early and late signal arrival times. The second method, “path based delay noise”, is a path based method where the reduced arrival uncertainty of the nets of a given path are utilized for pessimism reduction. We also propose a novel “uncertainty propagation ” technique as part of the second method, which results in an iteration free crosstalk noise aware STA of the path with significantly reduced pessimism. The two techniques are combined in a proposed methodology that is compatible with existing industrial static timing analyzers with very little computational overhead compared to the traditional noise aware STA and a significant improvement in eliminating unreal violations. The proposed techniques resulted in 77 % reduction of worst case negative slack and 57 % reduction in the number of failing paths in the setup analysis of a 90 nm industrial design. I...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{navigation}} {{is a vital}} {{need for}} many modern vehicular applications. The global positioning system (GPS) cannot provide continuous navigation information in urban areas. The widely used inertial navigation system (INS) can provide full vehicle state at high rates. However, the accuracy diverges quickly in low cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based INS due to bias, drift, noise, and other errors. These errors can be corrected in a stationary state. But detecting stationary state is a challenging task. A novel stationary state detection technique from the variation of acceleration, heading, and pitch and roll of an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) built from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors is proposed. Besides, the map matching (MM) algorithm detects the intersections where the vehicle is likely to stop. Combining these two results, the stationary state is detected with a smaller <b>timing</b> <b>window</b> of 3 [*]s. A longer <b>timing</b> <b>window</b> of 5 [*]s is used when the stationary state is detected only from the AHRS.

It remains unclear, however, whether and how coincident activity of converging efferent pathways can enable LTP and LTD in the pathways simultaneously. Here, we report that, in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, stimulation (600 pulses, 5 Hz) to Schaffer preceding to commissural pathway within a 40 -ms <b>timing</b> <b>window</b> induced similar magnitudes of LTP in both pathways onto synapses of CA 1 neurons, with varied LTP magnitudes after reversal of the stimulation sequence.

When there are no <b>timing</b> <b>window</b> constraints, we show that the commonlyused superposition algorithm results in 15 % underestimation on average, and propose a new SS + AS algorithm that has virtuallythe same complexityas the superposition algorithm but has a much improved accuracy. On average, the SS + AS algorithm onlyunderestimates WCN by 3 % compared to time-consuming simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. We also show that applying a RC model to the high-speed interconnects in the International TechnologyRoadmap for Semiconductors 0. 10 m technologyvirtuallyalways underestimates WCN, and the underestimation can be up to 80 %. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to consider aggressor switching and victim sampling windows.
