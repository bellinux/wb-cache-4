5000|$|Brushed {{machines}} are machines where the rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes {{in much the}} same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric slot car track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a [...] "brushed machine" [...] by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which <b>transfer</b> <b>current</b> without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a moving rotor while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.|$|E

5000|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are allotropes {{of carbon}} with a cylindrical nanostructure. They {{can be considered}} a rolled up graphene. When rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides whether the nanotube has a bandgap (semiconductoring) or no bandgap (metallic). Metallic carbon nanotubes have also been proposed for nanoelectronic interconnects since they can carry high current densities. [...] This is a useful property as wires to <b>transfer</b> <b>current</b> are another basic building block of any electrical system. Carbon nanotubes have specifically found so much use in NEMS that methods have already been discovered to connect suspended carbon nanotubes to other nanostructures. [...] This allows carbon nanotubes to form complicated nanoelectric systems. Because carbon based products can be properly controlled and act as interconnects as well as transistors, they serve as a fundamental material in the electrical components of NEMS.|$|E

40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{behaviour}} in anisotropic superconducting bodies is {{the central}} topic of this thesis and focuses on {{the effect that the}} nonlinearity of the electric field dependence upon the local current density value and anisotropy have on the nature of current transport. The main motivation for this work was the desire for {{a better understanding of the}} conceptually difficult behaviour of current transport in superconducting bodies and examines <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> quantitatively for a number of important problems on the macroscopic and microscopic scale. This behaviour is examined both experimentally and using computer models. The successful development of a powerful, robust and adaptable numerical model for analysing the complex <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has been the primary aim of this work. The range of parameters appropriate to macroscopic models of the Bi- 2212 CRT system has been experimentally examined using a specifically constructed apparatus for the measurement of current transport characteristics. A study of the self-field properties of the Bi- 2212 CRT material using a new experimental technique and mathematical analysis is presented and has allowed the importance of the self-field effect in the numerical model to be assessed. An essential requirement for the practical application of high current superconducting devices is the development of low resistance current contacts. The research presented examines this macroscopic <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> problem and aims to explain experimentally observed <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics at high applied currents. Existing models cannot explain these characteristics. <b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> on the microscopic scale is also examined. Models of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> have been developed from descriptions of specific microstructures that are thought to characterise the microstructure of Bi- 2223 and Bi- 2212 silver-sheathed tapes.

The EU was designed to <b>transfer</b> <b>currents</b> to 200 amperes at a potential of as high as 500 volts for an ultimate 100 kW/circuit transfer capability.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model for negative half cell of the vanadium redox flow batteryA stationary, isothermal, {{three-dimensional model}} for negative half cell of the vanadium redox flow battery is developed, {{which is based}} on the comprehensive conservation laws, such as charge, mass and momentum, together with a kinetic model for reaction involving vanadium species. The model is validated against the results calculated by the available two-dimensional model. With the given geometry of the negative half cell, the distributions of velocity, concentration, overpotential and <b>transfer</b> <b>current</b> density in the sections that are perpendicular and parallel to the applied current are studied. It is shown that the distribution of the electrolyte velocity in the electrode has significant impact on the distribution of concentration, overpotential and <b>transfer</b> <b>current</b> density. The lower velocity in the electrode will cause the higher overpotential, further result in the side reaction and corrosion of key materials locally. The development of the design of the vanadium redox flow battery is discussed, and the further research is proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
