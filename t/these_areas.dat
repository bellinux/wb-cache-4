5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the Kuril Islands, with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} in <b>these</b> <b>areas,</b> currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in <b>these</b> <b>areas,</b> with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment of protected areas {{around the world and}} the management of <b>these</b> <b>areas</b> to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside <b>these</b> <b>areas,</b> encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E

The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months.

The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in <b>these</b> <b>areas.</b> Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.|$|E
