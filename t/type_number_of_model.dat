40|$|High {{resolution}} synthetic stellar libraries are {{of fundamental}} {{importance for the}} preparation of the Gaia Mission. We present new sets of spectral stellar libraries covering two spectral ranges: 300 [...] 1100 nm at 0. 1 nm resolution, and 840 [...] 890 nm at 0. 001 nm resolution. These libraries span a large range in atmospheric parameters, from super-metal-rich to very metal-poor (- 5. 0 <[Fe/H]<+ 1. 0), from cool to hot (= 3000 [...] 50000 K) stars, including peculiar abundance variations. The spectral resolution, spectral <b>type</b> coverage and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> represent a substantial improvement over previous libraries used in population synthesis models and in atmospheric analysis.

The purpose of this review is to introduce readers to the possibilities of using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for analysis of GPCRs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main political influence factors {{accounting for the}} variation in public debt accumulation on a global scale. This allows for a reassessment of the recent focus on a regime type theory of public debt and for a test of an alternative governance theory. I argue that political stability, the rule of law, the control of corruption, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality promote lower public debt accumulation by reducing the incentives for governments to "borrow from the future", by increasing state capacity to collect taxes and effectively use public funds, and by providing more security and equity to private investment, inducing higher economic growth and tax revenues. Both theories are tested against a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> controls stemming from theories of public choice, theories of governmental distributional conflict, {{as well as from}} politico-institutional and macroeconomic explanations of public debt accumulation. Applying different specifications <b>of</b> quantitative <b>models,</b> the two governance indicators political stability and regulatory quality show consistent effects on public debt accumulation, partly confirming the proposed governance theory. Furthermore, the paper can reproduce a public debt-reducing effect of more democratic regime <b>types</b> across a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> specifications - though without a high degree of robustness...|$|R
40|$|Hmt 1 is the {{predominant}} arginine methyltransferase in yeast, involved in biological {{processes such as}} transcription, transcriptional regulation, nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and mRNAs and RNA splicing. Hmt 1 is also known to mediate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Despite its well-studied role in regulatory processes, the effects of Hmt 1 knockout on the transcriptome has never been performed. This thesis investigated {{the changes in the}} transcriptome upon deletion of Hmt 1, and through this, aimed to uncover as yet undiscovered biological functions of Hmt 1. RNA-seq was used to compare the transcriptomic profiles of wild type versus Hmt 1 -null cells. In mid-log exponential growth, we found dysregulation of phosphate metabolism and polyphosphate accumulation in the Hmt 1 -null strain. Acid phosphatases (PH 05, PH 011 and PH 012), phosphate transporters (PH 084 and PH 089) and the vacuolar transporter chaperone VTCJ were amongst genes significantly downregulated in hmt 1 /J [...] Concomitant decreases were observed in intracellular polyphosphate levels and extracellular phosphatase activity. We demonstrated that transcription factor Pho 4, responsible for activation of the phosphate regulatory pathway was methylated by Hmt 1 in vitro at Arg- 241. Genomic mutation of Arg- 241 to Lys in wild type produced to the same phenotype as hmt 1 /J [...] This is the first study to establish a link between arginine methylation and phosphate regulation. As polyphosphate is a source of phosphate, ATP and energy in the yeast cell, we extended our investigation to cells in quiescence. RNA-seq revealed more than 50 % genes were differentially expressed between hmt 1 /J. and wild type quiescent cells. Crucially, phosphate transport was still defective as the membrane-embedded phosphate transporters PH 084, PH 087, PH 089 and PH 090, vacuolar polyphosphate transporter PH 091 and exopolyphosphatase PPX 1 showed significant downregulation in hmt 1 /J. in quiescence. As a result of this dysregulation in phosphate importation and polyphosphate accumulation in hmt 1 /J., the Hmt 1 deletion strain exhibited advanced quiescence as compared to wild <b>type.</b> A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> are proposed to explain these observations...|$|R
40|$|Within the Dow Chemical Company the {{strategy}} is to centre process flowsheet design activities around the simulation tool Aspen Plus (from Aspen Tech Inc.). However, the <b>model</b> library <b>of</b> Aspen Plus is limited in <b>type</b> and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> process unit operations. Equation oriented modelling tools, such as gPROMS (from Process Systems Enterprise Ltd.) or Aspen Custom Modeler – ACM (from Aspen Tech Inc.), {{can be used to}} develop custom <b>models</b> <b>of</b> process unit operations which are not available in the Aspen Plus model library. For consistent flowsheet simulation and optimization it is required that these custom models can be exported to and used within Aspen Plus, just like any other model already available in the Aspen Plus model library. Recently, interfaces – based on the CAPE-OPEN standards - have been implemented in the latest releases of the above mentioned process simulation tools. To test the status and performance of the software interoperability, as well as to examine the custom model performance in Aspen Plus, a <b>model</b> <b>of</b> a gas separation membrane unit is developed in gPROMS and in ACM and exported for use in Aspen Plus. This thesis describes the achievements made {{in the development of the}} custom membrane model and its interfacing with Aspen Plus. Also, an improved method for model initialisation is presented. Model initialisation is one of the principal obstacles for the development <b>of</b> generic custom <b>models,</b> i. e. models which can run successfully irrespective of the set of components, physical property method, or range of operating conditions. The main conclusions from this study are that several software features enhance the development of generic and robust custom models in equation oriented modelling tools, such as a hierarchical model structure, the usage of an external physical property package, as well as the incorporation <b>of</b> a <b>model</b> initialisation structure (e. g. like the one proposed in this thesis). Moreover, the current functionality and performance of the interfaces for custom models between gPROMS and ACM on one side – and Aspen Plus on the other side – are not sufficient to be used for industrial practice. They need to be improved significantly by the software vendors. DelftChemTechApplied Science...|$|R
