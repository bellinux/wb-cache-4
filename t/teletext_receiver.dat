25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (Ceefax). It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The teletext characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and TV sets without a <b>Teletext</b> <b>receiver.</b> Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the system}} never caught {{on in the}} USA partly due to EIA-608 being {{deployed}} for captioning before Teletext was introduced and the higher cost of <b>Teletext</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{few other}} {{services}} were offered by some large-market TV {{stations in the}} US throughout the 1980s, such as Metrotext from KTTV in Los Angeles and KeyFax from WFLD in Chicago.Despite this, the system never caught on in the USA partly due to EIA-608 being deployed for captioning before Teletext was introduced and the higher cost of <b>Teletext</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Teletext allows up {{to eight}} 'magazines' to be broadcast, {{identified}} by the first digit of the three-digit page number (1–8). Within each magazine there may theoretically be up to 256 pages at a given time, numbered in hexadecimal and prefixed with the magazine number – for example magazine 2 may contain pages numbered 200-2FF. In practice, however, non-decimal page numbers are rarely used as domestic <b>teletext</b> <b>receivers</b> will not have options to select hex values A-F, with such numbered pages only occasionally used for 'special' pages {{of interest to the}} broadcaster and not intended for public view.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{advance in}} digital memory {{technology}} {{makes it possible}} to introduce Field Memories in television receivers. This type of memory can store a complete picture which allows a number of new features to be added to a television <b>receiver.</b> <b>Teletext</b> and still Video reception are such features and are the focus of this thesis. This thesis describes a low cost digital field memory to be used in conjunction with the T. V <b>receiver</b> to facilitate <b>Teletext</b> reception. Considerations involved and the design of an experimental system are described. Tests to evaluate the performance of the experimental system are discussed and results presented. To familiarize the reader with the topic, some background information on Teletext and Television is also provided...|$|R
