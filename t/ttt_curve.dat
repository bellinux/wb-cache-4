These concentrations were quite small at 650 degreesC, which is just below the bay temperature of the time-temperature-transformation (<b>TTT)</b> <b>curve</b> for the initiation of ferrite formation. There were larger concentrations at 630 degreesC, a temperature at which transformation stasis (incomplete transformation) occurred. Concentrations at 610 degreesC were intermediate between the values observed at 650 degreesC and 630 degreesC. The average accumulation at the latter temperatures increased appreciably as a function of transformation time. After each heat treatment, there was considerable variation in Mo accumulation from one alpha:gamma interface to another and, to a lesser extent, from one region to another along the same interface. These higher Mo concentrations were deduced to have developed largely through volume diffusion of Mo, mainly through ferrite, to interfaces whose ledgewise growth had been interrupted by growth stasis. (Mo 2 C precipitation at alpha:gamma boundaries occurred only at the end of growth stasis.) It appears that only a very small amount of Mo segregation is needed, probably at specific interfacial sites, in order to produce growth cessation.

40|$|With the {{development}} of bulk metallic glasses (BMG) in recent years, more and more scientists in solid state physics are {{trying to understand the}} mechanism of glass-formation in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, while engineers in metallurgy are trying different compositions and processes to improve the mechanical properties of BMGs and their composites. Glasses are nothing but frozen liquids. So far most of the studies of metallic glasses have been below the glass transition temperature because molten metallic liquids are chemically reactive with the container walls. For this reason, we used the Electrostatic Levitation (ESL) method that was developed by Dr. Won-Kyu Rhim. In this thesis, the instrumentation of the ESL is described. Discussion on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} ESL is given by comparing with the other levitation methods. Because of the advantage in sample position stability over all the other levitation methods, the ESL facility at Caltech is uniquely capable of measuring the viscosity and thermophysical properties of liquid metals in the undercooled temperature range. The ESL was further improved at Caltech to reduce temperature gradients on a sample and increase the stability of the sample positioning with a tetrahedral laser heating system. Using such an improved ESL, thermophysical properties of some evaporative metallic liquids such as Ti and silicon-germanium alloys have been successfully studied and mass loss as well as composition changes could be accounted for. Several BMGs developed at Johnson group at Caltech have been studied using ESL. Among the liquid thermodynamics and kinetic properties of interest, special attention has been paid on to measurements of the <b>TTT</b> <b>curve,</b> viscosity, and volume changes with temperature. These data give useful insight on the glass-forming mechanism. Through these studies, guidelines in the search for good ductile metallic glass-formers have emerged. Discussing these guidelines is an important part of this thesis. Finally, we discuss an investigation to understand observed hysteresis in the viscosity and the so-called threshold temperature that has been observed in some of the best glass-forming metallic liquids. We conclude this investigation with a hypothesis of a liquid-to-liquid phase transition that occurs above liquidus temperatures in several systems that we have studied. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{exceptional}} stability against crystallization {{of recently}} developed bulk metallic glasses, {{together with the}} non-contact measurement techniques to investigate their thermophysical properties, have opened the doors for detailed studies of these systems in the deep undercooled liquid state. The primary objective of this thesis is identification of reliable predictive indicators of glass-forming ability {{based on the measured}} thermophysical properties and intrinsic crystallization behavior of bulk metallic glasses. A number of bulk metallic glass-forming alloys having widely different glass-forming abilities are chosen for this investigation. All of the measurements are carried out using the noncontact high vacuum electrostatic levitation technique to avoid any heterogeneous nucleation effects from container walls or environment. The measured kinetic properties, viscosity, and free volume are found to have the most pronounced influence on glass-forming ability, while the thermodynamics show weak correlation with the trends in glass-formation. The glass-forming melts show orders of magnitude higher viscosity compared to pure metals. Among the glass-forming alloys, better glass formers have higher melting temperature viscosity, higher fragility, and show a smaller change in volume upon crystallization compared to poor glass formers. The melting temperature viscosity is correlated with volume change upon crystallization in accordance with Cohen-Grest free-volume theory {{for a wide variety of}} alloys. To quantify the glass-forming ability, Time-Temperature-Transformation (<b>TTT)</b> <b>curves</b> of a number of glass-forming melts are measured over a wide temperature range between their glass-transition and melting temperatures. A pronounced effect of overheating is observed on the undercooling levels and crystallization time scales.

The <b>TTT</b> <b>curves,</b> obtained after eliminating the heterogeneous influences, are found to scale with their respective glass transition temperatures.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{points and}} time-temperature-transformation (<b>TTT)</b> <b>curves</b> of the isothermal transformation diagrams for a high-speed steel casting on a horizontal {{centrifugal casting machine}} had been determined experimentally in the study. The effects of quenching temperature on the microstructures and properties of centrifugal casting high speed steel (HSS) roll has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light optical microscopy (LOM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as using tensile, impact, and hardness tests. The {{results show that the}} HSS roll has excellent hardenability and its matrix structure can be transformed into the martensite after being quenched in the sodium silicate solution. The retained austenite in the quenching structure increases and the hardness decreases when the quenching temperature exceeds 1, 040 ℃. The tensile strength and impact toughness of HSS roll increase once the quenching temperature is raised from 980 ℃ to 1, 040 ℃. However, the tensile strength and impact toughness have no signifi cant change when the quenching temperature exceeds 1, 040 ℃. The HSS roll quenched at 1, 040 ℃ exhibits excellent comprehensive mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the friction, wear and solid particle erosion behaviour of metallic glass Ni 78 Si 10 B 12 in the amorphous, semi and fully crystallized states. The crystallization behaviour of Ni 78 Si 10 B 12 alloy was investigated by isothermal annealing treatments at various temperatures (210 ∼ 550 °C) and times (0. 2 ∼ 200 h) and a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram was constructed. The <b>TTT</b> <b>curves</b> indicated time and temperature dependent transitions between three structures, namely amorphous, semi-crystalline (Amorphous + alpha-Ni, Amorphous + alpha-Ni + Ni 3 B) and fully crystalline (alpha-Ni + Ni 3 B) structures. Scratch tests were performed on amorphous and fully crystallized alloys using a pyramid diamond indenter under different loads (50 ∼ 1000 gf) at room temperature. Sliding wear tests on the amorphous as well as crystallized samples were conducted against 52100 steel pin in air at room temperature. Detailed analyses of wear debris and worn surfaces were done by scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and energy dispursive spectrum (EDS) to understand the wear mechanisms. Solid particle erosion tests were carried out using two different sizes (49 and 127 mum) of SiC particles used as erodents. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of the automotive industry {{is represented by the}} weight reduction of structural components achieved through the great potentiality of enhanced strength to mass ratio of high and ultra-high strength steels. The unacceptable loads on tool and springback phenomena obtained with traditional sheet metal forming operation of such materials at room temperature force industries to shift even more their attention to new forming technologies at elevated temperatures. The hot stamping of quenchable high strength steels offers in fact the possibility to reduce the body-in-white weight maintaining the crash requirements together with increased formability of sheets. However, the optimization of this innovative process chain through reliable FE simulations requires a deep knowledge of material behaviour in terms of microstructural evolution and resistance to plastic deformation in temperature. A new experimental set-up was developed in order to reproduce the thermo-mechanical conditions that material undergoes during the different phases of the industrial process and thus to overcome the absence in the technical- scientific literature of accurate data on material mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The influence of temperature and strain rate on 22 MnB 5 elastic and plastic properties was evaluated through uniaxial tensile tests, considering the effective strain after necking by means of an optical strain measurement system. An extensive dilatometric analysis perfomed through a modified axial extensometer, both with and without applied stress, was employed to evaluate the shift of the <b>TTT</b> <b>curves</b> due to stress as well as the transformation plasticity coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There are {{a number}} of bathtub and {{unimodal}} hazard shape parametric lifetime distributions available in the literature. Therefore, it is important to classify these distributions based on their hazard flexibility to facilitate their use in applica-tions. For this purpose we use the Total Time on Test (TTT) transform plot with two different criteria: I. measure the slope at the inflection point on the scaled TTT transform curve; II. measure the slope at selected points from the constant hazard line on the scaled <b>TTT</b> transform <b>curve.</b> We confine our research to classify the flexibility of Weibull extensions and generalizations and also select one-shape and two-shape parameter lifetime distributions to exemplify the two criteria process...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the crash {{characteristics}} and geometrical accuracy, components hot formed in a fully martensitic state have gained {{in the last few}} years more and more importance. However, the very high strength exhibited by these components makes subsequent operations such as cutting difficult due to the high process forces and associated high wear of the cutting tools. Moreover, for some applications, such as B-pillars and other automotive components that may undergo impact loading, it may be desirable to create regions of the part with softer and more ductile microstructures. The novel process called the tailored tempering process allows doing this by suppressing the martensitic transformation in those zones of the sheet located under heated parts of the tools. In the paper, a numerical model of the tailored tempering process was developed, accurately calibrated and validated through a laboratory-scale hot forming process. Using the commercial FE code Forge™ a fully coupled thermo-mechanical-metallurgical model of the process was set up. The influence of the phase transformation kinetics was taken into account by implementing in the model phase transformation data, namely the shift of the <b>TTT</b> <b>curves</b> due to the applied stress and the transformation plasticity coefficients, gained from an extensive dilatometric experimental campaign and analysis. A laboratory-scale hot-formed U-channel was produced using segmented tools with heated and cooled zones so that the cooling rate of the blank can be locally controlled during the hot forming process. The part Vickers hardness distribution and microstructural evolution predicted by FORGE™ were then compared with the experimental results, proving the validation of the numerical model by taking into account the influence of the transformation plasticity and deformation history on the phase transformation kinetics...|$|R
