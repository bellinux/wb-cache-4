5|$|A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} {{identified as a}} Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium.

5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, {{as a result of}} new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city.

5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, {{the position of the}} particle can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} {{globular}} cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth.

Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years.

5|$|The Songshan Airport in Taipei {{was shut}} down due {{to the threat of}} Typhoon Wipha. All businesses, {{including}} the stock exchange, were closed for September18. Typhoon warnings were issued in northern areas of the island and residents were warned about the possibility of landslides in the mountainous regions. Accordingly, 169 people left landslide-prone areas. An additional 237 people were evacuated from the northern areas of Taiwan due to the storm. A code red alert was issued for the areas closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the cyclone. Nearly 4,300 Chinese fishermen sought refuge in Taiwan after being called back to port.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm had}} {{undertaken}} a slow northeast motion early on February13 before turning southeast {{in response to}} a mid-level ridge located northeast of the cyclone.

Around 1200UTC, the storm attained Severe Tropical Cyclone status as winds reached 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds) and a small, irregularly shaped, eye began to develop. The JTWC, however, assessed Nancy to have been substantially weaker until 0000UTC on February14, at which time they reported a 95km/h (60mph) increase in winds, attaining minimal Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E
