500|$|When Polly Draper {{told her}} friend Julianne Moore and her husband, writer and {{director}} Bart Freundlich, about the film, Freundlich responded, [...] "Julia would love <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> movie." [...] Moore changed her schedule at late notice to participate in filming, and Draper wrote Moore's scene as it was being filmed; Draper quickly created a set that depicted the backstage green room of the talk show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Moore and Nat filmed the scene in one take, and Draper was impressed with her son's performance, while saying that Moore's presence added credibility to the project.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Dover Press reissued Goldman's biography, Living My Life, and in 1972, feminist writer Alix Kates Shulman {{issued a}} {{collection}} of Goldman's writing and speeches, Red Emma Speaks. These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, {{and she was in}} particular lionized by the women's movement of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from Living My Life about [...] "the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things", recounting that she had been admonished [...] "that it did not behoove an agitator to dance". The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of Goldman's most famous quotations, even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: [...] "If I can't dance I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> revolution." [...] Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E

[...] The New York Post wrote that the production [...] "has emerged triumphant.... These days, the nation is fixated less on war {{and more on the}} economy.

[...] Variety enthused, [...] "Director Diane Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast connect with the material in ways that cut right to the 1967 rock musical's heart, generating tremendous energy that radiates to the rafters. ... What could have been mere nostalgia instead becomes a full-immersion happening. ... If this explosive production doesn't stir something in you, {{it may be time to}} check your pulse." [...] The Boston Globe dissented, saying that the production [...] "felt canned" [...] and [...] "overblown" [...] and that the revival [...] "feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib".
