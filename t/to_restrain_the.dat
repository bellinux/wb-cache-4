5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; {{by the end of}} the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James I {{wished to}} end the practice, he found himself having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E

5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought {{to bring an end to}} the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, which led him <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for {{military}} protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E

5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

30|$|A multi-pitch {{tool path}} was {{developed}} for CCOS processes. With this tool path, the removal map is divided into several subregions, and the pitch in each subregion is set individually. In small removal subregions, the pitch is larger introducing less extra removal so that guarantee the convergence of the figure correction, while the large removal subregions the pitch is smaller so as to decrease the residual ripples. The multi-pitch tool path has been verified that it is beneficial <b>to</b> <b>restraining</b> <b>the</b> ripples while maintaining the convergence of the figure correction.|$|R
5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E
5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> <b>the</b> wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E

40|$|Aimed at imaging {{technology}} through scattering medium using fs electronic holography, {{a set of}} image process algorithm is put forward. This algorithm {{can be divided into}} three stages. First, every hologram is pre-processed, whose contrast is enhanced. Second, the first-order spatial spectrum is low-pass-filtered through a two-step process, so that high-frequency noise can be removed. Finally, many reconstructed images are ensemble-averaged. This stage can smooth random noise and is advantageous <b>to</b> <b>restraining</b> <b>the</b> speckle noise of image. The operation of this algorithm shows that all of processes in the three stages have obvious effects on improving image quality...|$|R

6000|$|Some {{time ago}} I ventured to defend that race of hunted and persecuted outlaws, the Bishops; but until this week I {{had no idea}} of how much persecuted they were. For instance, the Bishop of Birmingham made some {{extremely}} sensible remarks in the House of Lords, to the effect that Oxford and Cambridge were (as everybody knows they are) far too much merely plutocratic playgrounds. One would have thought that an Anglican Bishop might be allowed to know something about the English University system, and even to have, if anything, some bias in its favour.
