5|$|The English actor Henry Irving saw Mansfield's {{performance}} in New York and {{invited him to}} bring the play to London, where Irving managed the Lyceum Theatre in the West End. Although the play was scheduled to premiere in September 1888, Mansfield discovered that Bandmann planned <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> competing version in August, and he rushed to recall his company from vacation.|$|E
5|$|Greene wants <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> own restaurant, {{and asks}} Shondor Birns to help him. Birns {{arranges}} a $70,000 {{loan from the}} Gambinos, but Birns' courier buys cocaine with the money and gets arrested. Birns and Greene argue over which of them should pay back the money; when Greene refuses to pay, Birns hires a hitman to kill him. Greene narrowly escapes, and later kills Birns with a car bomb.|$|E

As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|James Clark {{was born}} to Robert and Susannah (Henderson) Clark on January 16, 1779, near the Peaks of Otter in Bedford County, Virginia. In 1794, {{the family moved to}} Clark County, Kentucky, where Clark was educated by Dr. James Blythe (who later became a {{professor}} at Transylvania University) and attended Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. Clark then went to Virginia, where he studied law with his brother, Christopher. He was admitted to the bar in 1797. He briefly traveled to Vincennes, Indiana and St. Louis, Missouri looking for a place <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> practice, but finding none that suited him, he returned to Kentucky and commenced practice in Winchester.|$|E
5|$|Ne-Yo {{ventured out}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> own {{recording}} studio, called Carrington House, in Atlanta, Georgia. He also had {{started his own}} production company, Compound Entertainment, in 2007, and has hired several producers and songwriters in hopes of {{turning it into a}} full-fledged record label. It successfully became a label, and artists such as RaVaughn, Paula Campbell, Sixx John, Adrienne Bailon and Shanell are now associated with Compound.|$|E

Butlin offered his patrons {{the chance to be}} re-sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp's construction. A number opted to stay and help, and received a free bottle of champagne as a reward. Once opened, the camp quickly became popular, accommodating around 5,000 campers and another 5,000 day visitors.|$|E
5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Stevenage, Byrom joined League One side Preston North End, then {{managed by}} Graham Westley, who had {{previously}} signed him for Stevenage. He signed on a free transfer. Byrom made his competitive debut for Preston in the club's 2–1 away victory over Bury, coming on as a second-half substitute. It took Byrom just three games <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> goalscoring account, scoring the first goal in the club's 5–0 win over Hartlepool United at Deepdale. In the club's following match four days later, on 22 September 2012, he netted in a 3–1 away defeat to Walsall, arriving unmarked {{in the area to}} give Preston an early lead in the match. His third and final goal of the campaign came at the beginning of November 2012, scoring {{from the edge of the}} area in Preston's 3–0 FA Cup win over Yeovil Town. Byrom made 27 appearances, eleven of which as a substitute, during his first season with the club, scoring three times.|$|E

5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Bridges {{signed for}} Conference South side Chelmsford City on a free transfer. He made his debut {{for the club}} in a 3–2 home win over Bromley on 25 August. Bridges scored his first goal for Chelmsford in the club's 2–2 draw with East Thurrock United in the FA Cup in October 2012, {{sweeping}} the ball through a crowded penalty area after East Thurrock had failed to clear a corner. It took Bridges seven months <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> goalscoring account for the league season, netting on the hour mark in a 6–0 home victory over Farnborough on 18 March 2013, {{a game in which}} he also assisted two other goals. It proved to be his only league goal of the campaign, in a season where Chelmsford would once again make the Conference South play-offs, but ultimately fall short. They lost 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to Salisbury City, with Bridges playing in both games. He made 36 appearances in all competitions during the season, scoring two goals.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> canopy.|$|E

5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{also worked}} with Irving and Stevenson's publisher, Longmans, to block Bandmann's {{production}} {{and those of other}} competitors. In the UK, unlike the U.S., the novella had copyright protection. Longmans brought legal actions against the unauthorized versions; its efforts blocked a William Howell Poole production from opening at the Theatre Royal in Croydon on July 26. That day, Fred Wright's Company B presented one performance of its adaptation at the Park Theatre in Merthyr Tydfil before it was also closed. Bandmann had the Opera Comique theater reserved from August 6, but hoped <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> production earlier. Irving blocked this by reserving the theater for Mansfield's rehearsals, and Mansfield's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde opened at the Lyceum on August 4. Bandmann went ahead with his August 6 opening, but after two performances the production was shut down because of legal action by Longmans.|$|E
5|$|Sivaji, an Indian {{software}} architect, {{returns to}} India from the United States. He aims {{to establish a}} non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service, but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high {{that he has to}} mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji {{falls in love with a}} girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.|$|E

5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> lead on Kovalainen; by lapeight {{it stood}} at 6.3seconds. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres {{over the next}} twolaps. Hamilton took 11thposition from Räikkönen on lap11, outbraking the Ferrari at turnfour. Fisichella collided with Coulthard twolaps later. As {{a result of the}} contact, the Force India's front wing broke loose and lodged under the car. Consequently, Fisichella lost control at turnnine, spinning into the gravel trap and retiring. Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap, beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next threelaps. Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap15. Hamilton passed Heidfeld, Glock, Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres, to sit in seventh by lap19.|$|E
5|$|Away to Wigan Athletic on 16 August 2016, Donaldson's {{penalty was}} saved, {{although}} the encroaching David Davis scored from the rebound to give Birmingham a lead {{they failed to}} protect. Two weeks later, he converted a penalty <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>his</b> account for the season before {{taking advantage of a}} defensive error to complete a 3–0 win over Norwich City. In the next match, Donaldson again missed a penalty, then ignored managerial orders that Jacques Maghoma should take any further spot kick and scored the winning goal from the penalty awarded after 49 minutes. After the match, Rowett confirmed that Donaldson would remain as designated taker, but advised him to practise. He duly scored from the spot in the very next match. Donaldson's sixth goal, again a penalty, came against Ipswich Town in December. He was stretchered off soon afterwards with an Achilles tendon injury which kept him out for three months, by which time the team were in a relegation battle under the management of Gianfranco Zola, who had taken over the day after the Ipswich match. He made four appearances, with only one start, before a knee injured in training forced him out until the last 20 minutes of the final match, away to Bristol City, in which he helped Birmingham defend a 1–0 lead to avoid relegation.|$|E
