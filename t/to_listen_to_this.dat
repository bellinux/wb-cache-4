25|$|Also, free distribution, even if unauthorized, can be {{beneficial}} to small or new content providers by spreading and popularizing content and therefore generating a larger consumer base by sharing and word of mouth. Several musicians have grown to popularity by posting their music videos on sites like YouTube where the content is free <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> method of putting the product {{out in the world}} free of DRM not only generates a greater following but also fuels greater revenue through other merchandise (hats, T-shirts), concert tickets, and of course, more sales of the content to paying consumers.|$|E
25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music is not some baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E

500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] is a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. It {{contains}} sample of the recording [...] "Sabali" [...] which is written by Damon Albarn, Mariam Doumbia and Marc A. Moreau published by Chrysalis Music. [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] starts with [...] "crooning by a chipmunk-like voice", and after that Levine professes [...] "Iâ€™m here to wipe your eyes" [...] to his broken-hearted romantic interest. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse criticized {{the opening of the}} song labeling it as [...] "jarring nonsensical sounds"; the sounds can also be heard in the background. However, according to her, [...] "they're minor issues with an album that is bound to get at least one song other than 'Payphone' stuck in your head." [...] Alt Rock Live's Keaton Fletcher in a review of Overexposed, wrote that the beginning of the song makes you ask yourself [...] "do you really want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> song?" [...] However, he concluded that after its first thirty seconds it sounds like typical Maroon 5 song on which you feel smooth sexuality. A reviewer of Kiss 95.1 radio wrote that [...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] together with [...] "Love Somebody" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Goodbye" [...] "are 'fan favorites' songs".|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Melody Maker ran {{a feature}} {{in which many}} pop musicians were asked whether they {{believed}} that the album was truly revolutionary or progressive. The author concluded that [...] "the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable." [...] Among the musicians contributing to the 1966 Melody Maker survey, Spencer Davis of the Spencer Davis Group said: [...] "Brian Wilson is a great record producer. I haven't spent much time listening to the Beach Boys before, but I'm a fan now and I just want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> LP again and again." [...] Then a member of Cream, Eric Clapton, reported that everyone in his band loved the album. Andrew Oldham said: [...] "I think that Pet Sounds is the most progressive album of the year in as much as Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade was. It's the pop equivalent of that, a complete exercise in pop music." ...|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic stated [...] "Mythos is as {{powerful}} as its predecessor (1999's Remembering Thomas), {{but this time the}} Mario Pavone Nu Trio becomes a quintet on three tracks. The guests are trumpeter Steven Bernstein and tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, both of whom bring a fiery irreverence to Pavone's music ... Pavone's sturdy bass playing anchors the session, leading the group through involved unison passages, consistently grooving solo statements, and inspired rubato dialogue". All About Jazz observed, [...] "the most exciting part of Mythos is Pavone himself. You can take many approaches <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> record, but if you make the effort <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his lines, you'll hear an unswerving devotion to forward motion. Pavone can walk for years, but he has a flair for drama and angularity which he lets loose with regularity. Admittedly these pieces are in all sorts of weird time signatures, and they often shift styles midstream, but Pavone is clearly the locomotive driving this train: pure diesel power. His lines reveal the contours of the music, rendering each composition logical and coherent". In JazzTimes Harvey Siders wrote, [...] "Pavone's writing is so harmonically daring and unpredictable that those with the technique of a Madsen or Wilson tend to bury the bass line. Imagine the texture when the horns are added. Unless Pavone is actually soloing, there are not enough opportunities <b>to</b> fully appreciate <b>this</b> late bloomer's bass playing".|$|R
