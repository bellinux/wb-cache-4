50|$|The parka and {{trousers}} (which have been {{adapted to the}} civilian outdoor clothing market) are themselves constructed in a three-layer fashion consisting of an outer layer of abrasion-resistant <b>taslan</b> nylon, an intermediate layer of durably waterproof, windproof, and Gore-Tex membrane (protected {{with a layer of}} nylon tricot and originally in a four-color camouflage print), and a hung inner layer of unlaminated nylon. The whole is seam-sealed.|$|E
5000|$|Taslanizing or the <b>Taslan</b> process, is the copyrighted {{trade name}} for air {{textured}} yarns. In German {{the word is}} Luftex. The process is simply feeding a bundle of continuous filament yarns into a small jet nozzle with various amounts of slack (overfeed). High pressure air ( [...] > 100 PSI [...] ) creates a suction and a turbulent airstream which tangles any slack into a yarn with a similar hand as a spun yarn. It is the turbulent airflow that tangles the fibers. This method of yarn productions creates a yarn that is normally more even than a spun yarn and does not pill like a spun yarn.|$|E

One of ASLan’s core features over IF is to integrate a tran-sition system with Horn clauses that are evaluated at every state. This allows for modeling many common situations in security such as the interaction between the workflow of a system with its access control policies. While even the transition relation is undecidable for ASLan in general, we show the security problem is decidable for a large and useful fragment that we call <b>TASLan,</b> as long as we bound the number of steps of honest participants. The restriction of <b>TASLan</b> is that all messages and pred-icates must be in a certain sense unambiguous in their interpretation, excluding “type-confusions ” similar to some tagging results for security protocols. ...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{waterborne}} {{polyurethane coating}} on the durability and breathable waterproofing of electrospun nanofiber web-laminated fabrics Kyong Ah Hong 1, Hwa Sook Yoo 2 and Eunae Kim 1 An electrospun nanofiber web membrane is thinner, lighter and more moisture permeable than {{other types of}} mem-brane, but it has low waterproof and has poor abrasion resistance. To improve its waterproofness and abrasion resist-ance a waterborne polyurethane coating has been applied and the change in water vapor permeability and waterproofness, examined, together with {{its effect on the}} fabric structure. The effect of the hydrophilicity of the coating resin on these were properties was also assessed. Taffeta and <b>taslan</b> were used as the base fabrics, and the hydrophilicity of the coating resins was maintained at 10, 15, and 20 %. Conclusions drawn from the study were that following the coating process the abrasion resistance and waterproofness improved; in taffeta the water vapor permeability decreased, but in <b>taslan</b> both properties decreased. Water vapor permeability and waterproofness were not significantly affected by the hydrophilicity of the coating resins. The surface flatness of the base fabric is shown to be an important factor i...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Two completely different approaches {{have been used to}} study the mechanism of the air-jet method of bulking filament yarns. Part A is an aerodynamic study {{of the nature of the}} air flow and of its characteristics, and of the yarn's behaviour during the bulking process. The experimentation involves the use of scaled-up models of the du Pant type 9 commercial <b>Taslan</b> air-jet and of a typically used parent yarn. The study is extended to include a modification of the jet suggested by earlier workers. The results of these investigations provide new evidence regarding the mechanism of the process and the construction of bulked yarns of this type. It is also concluded that the commercially used air-jet on which the model study has been based, is not ideally designed from the stand-point of efficiency, stability and ease of operation. In Part B, a suggested mechanism of the air-jet bulking action is simulated by a purely mechanical means. The simulation of the process has been so effective that yarns of the air-jet bulked type are produced by a method not requiring any compressed air. The preliminary work leading to the design of an experimental apparatus is briefly reported. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the process are made, and the bulked yarn properties for various parent yarn particulars and processing conditions are measured and assessed. An economic evaluation of the process has been attempted, based on a comparison with the limited cost figures available for <b>Taslan</b> processing. - The individual nature of each of the two main investigations has necessitated that the results should be separately discussed in the ultimate Chapter of each Part of the thesis. Suggestions for further work are also made for each of the two techniques...|$|E
