6000|$|... "Providing {{the bears}} did not disturb him," [...] {{answered}} Giant. [...] "By the way, {{what are you}} going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bear we shot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Talking of stakes,' said Lord St. Jerome, who pricked up {{his ears}} at a congenial subject, 'do {{you know what}} they are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> affair of Anderson's?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What are {{you going}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> shooting? I {{had a right to}} shoot that man,' says he. 'He called me names that I couldn't overlook, and then he struck me. He carried a gun, too. What else could I do?' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Juliette after a second's {{hesitation}} threw it among her dresses in the valise.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, Lizzie,' said Katherine pettishly, 'do {{not be so}} {{provoking}} with Priam and {{all that}} stuff, but tell us what is <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> horrid Institute.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Selina, if he won't, I can't help it; and I'm sure, now I {{think about}} the cook, I don't see how we're to expect anybody to stay. What am I <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Griffiths, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> horrid woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|From dictating {{but little}} I fell to dictating almost nothing at all. To keep my {{secretary}} at work, I gave her some notes of travel of {{which to make}} a fair copy, while I occupied myself in wondering what I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> malarial husband.|$|E
6000|$|Life at Brookport had so {{accustomed}} him {{to being}} plain Bill Chalmers {{that it had}} absolutely slipped his mind {{that he was really}} Lord Dawlish, the one man in the world whom Elizabeth looked on as an enemy. What on earth was he <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> Tell her? But if he told her, wouldn't she chuck him on the spot? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Muggeridge {{has been}} playing the very mischief." [...] Muggeridge was the second clerk in Cradell's room. [...] "We're going to put him into Coventry and not speak to him except officially. But {{to tell you the}} truth, my hands have been so full here at home, that I haven't thought much about the office. What am I <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> woman?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{plan to go}} {{to college}} thought, and I try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> action, because I cannot simply command myself not to be afraid anymore (by means of rational decision). This is a direct relation between thought and action.|$|R
5000|$|I feel {{anxious and}} afraid feeling, and I try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> action. This is a crossed relation between feeling and action - the client tries {{to change his}} feelings through voluntary action but, as expected, he is unable to.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} {{any of those}} things. Come, dear, let's just talk it over sensibly, as we might talk over any other of the great crises of life. You've been {{brooding}} over it and let yourself drift into a morbid view of it. You {{know you have a}} little tendency <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> everything <b>that</b> goes wrong, and you promised me that you would fight against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same, I hate {{dropping}} research. It's stuff I'm made <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>About</b> <b>that,</b> Solomonson, I'm almost superstitious. I {{could say}} I had a call.... It's the maddest state of affairs! Now that I'm doing absolutely my best work for mankind, work I firmly believe {{no one else}} can do, I just manage to get six hundred--nearly two hundred of my eight hundred is my own. What does the world think I could do better--that would be worth four times as much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{the small}} things all taken care of," [...] Dick said to Tom and Sam, {{on the evening}} of the second day. [...] "But what I am going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> twenty {{thousand}} dollars we must pay the Sharon Valley Land Company, and that other claim Mr. Powell spoke about, I don't know. It looks to me as {{if we were going to}} get into a hole, unless I'm able to get some of our friends to help us out." ...|$|E
60|$|That his wife's {{feelings}} were hurt he cared not a jot, {{but it would}} be an awkward thing to have it repeated in the town. Then there was this threatening letter; what was he <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> Other men had had similar warnings. Some had defied Captain Lud, and fortified their mills and held them. Many had had their property burned to the ground; some had been murdered. It wouldn't be a pleasant thing to drive about in the country knowing that at any moment he might be shot dead. His mill was some little distance out of the town; the road was dark and lonely. He dared not risk it.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Ireland," [...] he confided. [...] "Sorry {{to desert}} you as I did, but you <b>do</b> not begin <b>to</b> count for us just yet. There {{was just a}} faint doubt {{as to what they}} were <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> internment. <b>That</b> is why I had to get the Irish trip off my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> child, Ogden. He's been worrying uncle Peter again, and I'm {{not going}} to have it. I warned him once that, if he did it again, awful things would happen to him, but he didn't believe me. I suppose, Jerry--what sort of a man is your friend, Mr. Smethurst?" ...|$|R
60|$|Even in {{the midst}} of my {{agitation}} this thought made me smile. How much I was making of this affair of my secretary. What difference, after all--But I did not continue the latter question. It did make a difference, and it was of no use to reason about it. What was I <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? <b>That</b> was more to the point.|$|R
6000|$|In the evening, {{when the}} ladies {{had gone to}} bed, Lord Chiltern took his friend off to the smoking-room. At Harrington Hall {{it was not unusual}} for the ladies and gentlemen to descend {{together}} into the very comfortable Pandemonium which was so called, when,--as was the case at present,--the terms of intimacy between them were sufficient to warrant such a proceeding. But on this occasion Lady Chiltern went very discreetly upstairs, and Adelaide, with equal discretion, followed her. It had been arranged beforehand that Lord Chiltern should say a salutary word or two to the young man. Maule began about the hunting, asking questions about this and that, but his host stopped him at once. Lord Chiltern, when he had a task on hand, was always inclined to get through it at once,--perhaps with an energy that was too sudden in its effects. [...] "Maule," [...] he said, [...] "you ought to make up your mind what you mean <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, Berkeley,' Lancaster droned out in {{the lobby}} of their club one {{afternoon}} shortly afterwards, 'what on earth am I ever <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> socialistic friend of yours, Le Breton? I can't ever give him any political work again, you know. Just fancy! first, you remember, I set him upon the Schurz imprisonment business, and he nearly went mad then because I didn't back up Schurz for wanting to murder the Emperor of Russia. After that, just now the other day, I tried him on the Bodahl business, and hang me if he didn't have qualms of conscience about it afterwards, and trudge back through all the snow that awful Tuesday, to see if he couldn't induce Wilks to stop the press, and let him cut it all out at the last moment! He's as mad as a March hare, you know, and if it weren't that I'm really sorry for him I wouldn't go on taking socials from him any longer. But I will; I'll give him work as long as he'll do it for me on any terms; though, of course, it's obviously impossible under the circumstances to let him have another go at politics, isn't it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{that poor}} Mark {{had a very}} uneasy night of it. It was clear enough that Lord Lufton had thought, {{if he did not}} still think, that the stall at Barchester was to be given as pecuniary recompense in return for certain money {{accommodation}} to be afforded by the nominee to the dispenser of this patronage. Nothing on earth could be worse than this. In the first place it would be simony; and then it would be simony beyond all description mean and simoniacal. The very thought of it filled Mark's soul with horror and dismay. It might be that Lord Lufton's suspicions were now at rest; but others would think the same thing, and their suspicions {{it would be impossible to}} allay; those others would consist of the outer world, which is always so eager to gloat over the detected vice of a clergyman. And then that wretched horse which he had purchased, and the purchase of which should have prohibited him from saying that nothing of value had accrued to him in these transactions with Mr. Sowerby! what was he <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> And then of late he had been spending, and had continued to spend, more money than he could well afford. This very journey of his up to London would be most imprudent, if it should become necessary for him to give up all hope of holding the prebend. As to that he had made up his mind; but then again he unmade it, as men always do in such troubles. That line of conduct which he had laid down for himself in the first moments of his indignation against Lord Lufton, by adopting which he would have to encounter poverty, and ridicule, and discomfort, the annihilation of his high hopes, and the ruin of his ambition--that, he said to himself over and over again, would now be the best for him. But it is so hard for us to give up our high hopes, and willingly encounter poverty, ridicule, and discomfort! ...|$|E
50|$|WAVEs {{more recent}} research, {{following}} {{the publication of}} Violence and what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it, shows <b>that</b> child maltreatment also underlies subsequent problems with mental health, physical health, educational performance, wealth generation and antisocial behaviour.|$|R
50|$|South America was an {{important}} neutral source of trade for the Axis forces; its importance would increase after the US entered the war. The Italian airline LATI operated a transatlantic service between Rome and Rio de Janeiro, which was a conduit for high value goods (platinum, mica, diamonds etc.), agents and diplomatic bags. London instructed BSC <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{the church}} {{takeover}} incident, William Parshall, the deputy city managing director, {{known as the}} Philadelphia [...] "housing czar," [...] was asked whether Honkala's in-your-face tactics [...] "made his job difficult." [...] Parshall replied that he was far more concerned with such pending problems as national and state welfare cuts. He added, [...] "The question is, {{what are we going}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? <b>That's</b> the question Cheri should be asking." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What are {{you going}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> boy?...His future, his schooling. His disability.—He's your heir, I suppose?" ...|$|E
50|$|Hi, {{this is me}} and my son Prentiss. We're from Atlanta. I want to ask {{you guys}} a {{question}} (inaudible) every year. But what about the war going on in our country, black on black crime? Two hundred to 400 black men die yearly in one city alone. What are you going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> war? It feels like the Taliban is right outside.|$|E
5000|$|On May 21, 2006, while {{promoting}} {{the release of}} the album Taking the Long Way, Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President Bush, saying, [...] "I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people are going to ask me to apologize based on who I am ... I don't know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I can't change who I am." ...|$|E
25|$|Alexander had {{realized}} that people from noble families {{were being treated}} with little dignity and wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion's tact and sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't. Too flighty. I <b>did</b> used <b>to</b> think <b>about</b> <b>doing</b> just <b>that,</b> curiously enough, but I {{seem to have}} {{drifted away}} from the idea. Oh, I'm a fine one to be lecturing you!" ...|$|R
50|$|As the Secretary General of Finance in the Provisional Government of the French Republic from August 29 to September 4, 1944, he had {{to decide}} what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the gold <b>that</b> the Nazi Party requisitioned from the National Bank of Belgium {{following}} the Second Armistice at Compiègne in 1940, which they later sold to the Swiss National Bank.|$|R
50|$|Shizuku's mother lives {{apart from}} her family because of her work as the {{breadwinner}} of the family. Shizuku looks up to her as how {{she wants to be}} growing up, and would often give status reports of her academic progress in her talks with her. When Shizuku tells her that she likes a boy but doesn't know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and school, she encourages Shizuku to double her effort so she can do both. She also appears briefly at Yuzan's birthday party where she had fended off a pass from a congressman.|$|E
5000|$|Much to {{the chagrin}} of his {{economic}} advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, [...] "What do you want me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> today?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon {{was elected}} {{president}} and Barry Goldwater went to Washington as Arizona's junior senator. Hess, despite now {{being a member of}} the New Left, had recently written some speeches for Goldwater and resumed their close personal relationship; he had concluded that American men should not be forced into military service and urged Goldwater to submit legislation abolishing conscription. Goldwater replied, [...] "Well, let's wait and see what Dick Nixon wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> one." [...] Hess despised Nixon almost as much as he admired Goldwater and could not tolerate the notion that Goldwater would defer to Nixon. Thus ended one of Hess's closest professional associations, and the situation significantly compromised one of his deepest friendships.|$|E
50|$|From 1943 through 1945 Rowland {{served in}} World War II in the United States Army Air Corps, the 8th Air Force, 94th Bomb Group, 333rd Squadron, as a 1st Lieutenant, B17 (“Flying Fortress”) pilot. He was {{stationed}} in Bury St. Edmunds, England and made 22 combat missions over Nazi occupied territory. During that time {{he was awarded the}} Air Medal and several clusters. It was during those long, sometimes 12 hour missions, sitting in beastly uncomfortable seats, Rowland said, that “I resolved <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>about</b> <b>that</b> if I ever returned home safely”.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons Smeal {{decided to run for}} yet another term as President was not only due to the support of many other NOW members, but from her wish that NOW could be more outspoken, assertive, and {{publicly}} active on multiple different issues. These issues included abortion rights, on {{the role of women in}} the church, and the Vatican’s policy on reproduction. Smeal also noted that while Goldsmith was in power the organization lost its focus and membership declined and she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That, also, have we considered," [...] Ernest replied. [...] "And {{we shall}} {{give you an}} answer in terms of lead. Power you have proclaimed the king of words. Very good. Power it shall be. And in the day that we sweep to victory at the ballot-box, and you refuse to turn over to us the {{government}} we have constitutionally and peacefully captured, and you demand {{what we are going}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it--in <b>that</b> day, I say, we shall answer you; and in roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns shall our answer be couched.|$|R
