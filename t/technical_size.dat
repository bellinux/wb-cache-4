40|$|Nowadays {{cast iron}} {{components}} {{are widely used}} in highly stressed structures. Component lifetime is strongly influenced by inhomogeneities caused by the material's microstructure and the manufacturing process (graphite particles, (micro-) shrinkage pores, inclusions). Inhomogeneities often act as a fatigue crack starter. Lifetime until failure may be divided into stages for crack initiation, short and long crack growth. Initiation of a crack of <b>technical</b> <b>size</b> (a ? 1 mm) is often dominated by the growth of short cracks. The paper presents an approach to analyze the mechanically short fatigue crack growth based on elastic-plastic fracture mechanics.

40|$|In this paper, the Free Coordination Hull (FCH) {{approach}} {{developed by}} Green and Cook (2004) {{is combined with}} the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) model to detect potential gains from specialization. As a non-convex approach that allows both directly observed and summed decision making units (DMUs) to define the production technology, FCH is the relevant model for analyzing optimal reapportionment of activity among smaller and more specialized units. Indeed the convexity assumption in more traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models precludes the possibility of detecting potential gains from specialization and can only reveal economies of scope. Therefore non-convex technologies are required to model diseconomies of scope. Based on FDH and FCH technologies, an overall efficiency measure is decomposed into three components, namely <b>technical,</b> <b>size</b> and specialization efficiencies. A database of French farms for the year 2003 is used for illustration. Results indicate that input inefficiency in the agricultural sector is driven mainly by lack of specialization, which represents about 50 % of overall inefficiency. specialization; free coordination hull; free disposal hull; agriculture...|$|E

Extractive measurements were performed in the flame using an oil-cooled particle extraction probe. The particle size distribution was measured with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and the optical properties were measured using a Photo Acoustic Soot Spectrometer (PASS- 3). A detailed radiation model {{was used to examine}} the influence of the soot volume fraction on the particle radiation intensity. The properties of the gas were calculated with a statistical narrow-band model and the particle properties were calculated using Rayleigh theory with four different complex indices of refraction for soot particles. The modelled radiation was compared with measured total radiative intensity, the latter which was measured with a narrow angle radiometer. The results show that the measured soot volume fraction yields particle radiation that corresponds well with the determined difference between gas and total radiation.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of mobile {{applications}} has increased considerably. For instance the number of applications in the largest app store for AndroidTM mobile operating system - Google Play has exceeded two millions. As the visibility of individual applications is low {{it is not surprising}} that the majority of applications have only a very small number of downloads or users. One of the important factors in attracting new users is application’s visibility on the charts of the most popular applications (top charts). Therefore, one of the objectives of the application developers it to position their applications on the top charts. The main goal of the master thesis was to determine what <b>technical</b> (<b>size</b> and permissions) and other (user ratings, number of ratings, the number of days since the last update, number of screenshots [...] .) characteristics of the applications have a significant impact on their performance. Performance is determined by using the three criteria: the position of application on the top charts, the number of the application downloads and user ratings of the application. To achieve this goal we captured and analysed data of the most popular apps on Google Play in the three main types (Applications, Games and Family). We studied these categories in further detail considering whether the applications are free, paid, new free and new paid. All together we got 12 different groups of applications that we name genres. United states top charts were selected for the study as they represent the largest and most interesting market. The data was collected by using web scrapper. Statistical tests were performed on the collected data separately for each genre to determine the impact of technical and other characteristics of the applications on their performance. The results showed both similarities and differences between genres. While some characteristics are specific only for certain genres, others are valid for all or most genres. For instance, larger size of applications in contrast to assertions of many developer web pages did not prove to be a very negative feature. Applications that have been updated recently and are not new, are generally higher on the charts and have higher user ratings than others. Applications with a large number of user ratings are also higher on the chart, have larger number of downloads and in most genres a higher user ratings. Most apps that are higher on the chart and have a higher number of downloads use more permissions. Consequentially this means that they also offer more functionality. Despite the fact Google recommends limiting the number of permissions this does not seem to be a decisive factor especially in comparison to the number of supported functionalities. ...|$|E
