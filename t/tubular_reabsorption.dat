40|$|In marine elasmobranch fishes, renal <b>tubular</b> urea <b>reabsorption</b> is, in part, {{responsible}} {{for the maintenance of}} a high plasma urea concentration. Furthermore, the regulation of <b>tubular</b> urea <b>reabsorption</b> is important in the renal response of euryhaline elasmobranchs to changes in environmental salinity. The mechanisms by which <b>tubular</b> urea <b>reabsorption</b> is regulated in the elasmobranch kidney have yet to be elucidated, but both passive and active mechanisms have been proposed. Passive reabsorption of urea occurs via facilitated urea transporter proteins (UT). A facilitated urea transporter (shUT), {{similar to that of the}} UT-A 2 isoform in mammals, has been cloned from the kidney of the marginal elasmobranch, the spiny dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias (Smith and Wright, 1999). Interestingly, although only a single facilitated urea transporter isoform was identified, Northern analysis suggested that multiple isoforms may be expressed in the elasmobranch kidney.

40|$|Background. Insulin induces {{increasing}} distal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption.</b> Opposite {{effects of}} insulin to offset insulin-induced sodium retention are supposedly increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and decreases in proximal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption.</b> Defects in these opposing effects could link insulin resistance to blood-pressure elevation and salt sensitivity. Methods. We assessed {{the relationship between}} the effects of sequential physiological and supraphysiological insulin dosages (50 and 150 mU/kg/h) on renal sodium handling, and insulin sensitivity and salt sensitivity using the euglycaemic clamp technique and clearances of [I- 131]hippuran, [I- 125]iothalamate, sodium, and lithium in 20 normal subjects displaying a wide range of insulin sensitivity. Time-control experiments were performed in the same subjects. Salt sensitivity was determined using a diet method. Results. During the successive insulin infusions, GFR increased by 5. 9 % (P = 0. 003) and 10. 9 % (P < 0. 001), while fractional sodium excretion decreased by 34 and 50 % (both P < 0. 001). Distal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption</b> increased and proximal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption</b> decreased. Insulin sensitivity correlated with changes in GFR during physiological (r = 0. 60, P = 0. 005) and supraphysiological (r = 0. 58, P = 0. 007) hyperinsulinaemia, but not with changes in proximal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption.</b> Salt sensitivity correlated with changes in proximal <b>tubular</b> sodium <b>reabsorption</b> (r = 0. 49, P = 0. 028), but not in GFR, during physiological hyperinsulinaemia. Neither insulin sensitivity or salt sensitivity correlated with changes in overall fractional sodium excretion. Conclusions. Insulin sensitivity and salt sensitivity correlate with changes in different elements of renal sodium handling, but not with overall sodium excretion, during insulin infusion.

We undertook a systematic study {{on the effects of}} dietary salt intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and <b>tubular</b> Na+ <b>reabsorption.</b> We examined the renal adaptive response in mice subjected to 7 days of a low sodium diet (LSD) containing 0. 01 % Na+, a normal sodium diet (NSD) containing 0. 18 % Na+, as well as a moderately high sodium diet (HSD) containing 1. 25 % Na+. As expected, LSD did not alter measured GFR and increased the abundance of total and cell-surface NHE 3, NKCC 2, NCC, α-ENaC, and cleaved γ-ENaC compared to NSD. Mathematical modelling predicted that <b>tubular</b> Na+ <b>reabsorption</b> increased in the proximal tubule but decreased in the distal nephron because of diminished Na+ delivery. This prediction was confirmed by the natriuretic response to diuretics targeting the thick ascending limb, the distal convoluted tubule or the collecting system. On the other hand, HSD did not alter measured GFR but decreased the abundance of the aforementioned transporters compared to NSD. Mathematical modelling predicted that <b>tubular</b> Na+ <b>reabsorption</b> decreased in the proximal tubule but increased in distal segments with lower transport efficiency with respect to O 2 consumption. This prediction was confirmed by the natriuretic response to diuretics. The activity of the metabolic sensor AMPK was related to the changes in <b>tubular</b> Na+ <b>reabsorption.</b> Our data show that fractional Na+ reabsorption is distributed differently according to dietary Na+ intake and induces changes in tubular O 2 consumption and sodium transport efficiency.

On acute saline loading of seven normally hydrated patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and five patients with malignancy, raised values of TmCa/GFR were reduced to normal in most cases, in association with increases in NaE. The reduction in TmCa/GFR, which occurred, {{may have been due}} to a reduction in proximal <b>tubular</b> calcium <b>reabsorption</b> associated with sodium: this would have obscured the effect of humorally mediated increases in distal <b>tubular</b> calcium <b>reabsorption,</b> which are stimulated either by parathyroid hormone or by a putative humoral mediator in hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients who were normally hydrated NaE and TmCa/GFR were not significantly correlated.

In clinical practice changes in TmCa/GFR associated with sodium seem to be of minor importance under normal circumstances, but they become evident at the upper and lower extremes of urinary sodium excretion.

50|$|A {{decrease}} in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone {{production in the}} hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption.

The net result of these 4 mechanisms of {{salt and water retention}} is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood.
