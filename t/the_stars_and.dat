5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} stellar {{clusters}} have similar velocities to <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU.

Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{force of}} Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled {{the development of}} great civilizations. However, this thriving period eventually {{gave way to a}} worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy. The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, are hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with help from a raiding party, storm Mt. Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves. They fail to solve the riddles guarding <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.|$|E

5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several hundred men, {{and the smaller}} ones may {{have more than a}} hundred men on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> <b>and</b> in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest in adopting a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag consisting of the state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E

5|$|KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, {{who would}} be {{introduced}} in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did {{not appear in the}} backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with <b>the</b> <b>Stars,</b> <b>and</b> provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money.

5|$|Martello {{claimed that}} {{in the summer of}} 1964, he moved to Tangier, Morocco, where he {{researched}} the history of the tarot, resulting in the publication of It's in the Cards (1964). Returning to the U.S. in 1965, he moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York City, writing a book on astrology, It's Written in <b>the</b> <b>Stars,</b> <b>and</b> a book on psychic protection, How to Prevent Psychic Blackmail. He also began attending the Spiritualist gatherings that were operated by Clifford Bias at the Ansonia Hotel. At some point High Priestess Lori Bruno founded a witchcraft coven and church, Our Lord and Lady of the Trinacrian Rose, in which Leo was acknowledged as Elder. In 1969 he publicly revealed himself to be a practitioner of Witchcraft; claiming that he had gained the permission of his coven to do so. Intent on countering the negative publicity that Wicca had been receiving, he published The Weird Ways of Witchcraft in 1969, the same year that he also published The Hidden World of Hypnotism.|$|E
