5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
5|$|An {{account of}} the war by the Byzantine Theophylact Simocatta sentimentalises <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the conflict, {{claiming}} it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter Rosamund, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, where she was captured only {{after the death of}} her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of Sirmium, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor Justin II sent his son-in-law Baduarius as magister militum (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle {{and what can be}} termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged {{as a result of the}} pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Author Masaru Takeuchi {{attributes}} {{the origin of}} the quick time event game mechanic to laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. IGN's Levi Buchanan listed FMV games like Time Gal as one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the Mega-CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{rise of the}} Sasanian Empire in Persia {{considerably}} damaged Palmyrene trade. The Sasanians disbanded Palmyrene {{colonies in}} their lands, and began a war against the Roman empire. In an inscription dated to 252 Odaenathus appears bearing the title of exarchos (lord) of Palmyra. The weakness of the Roman empire and the constant Persian danger were probably <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the Palmyrene council's decision to elect a lord for the city in order for him to lead a strengthened army. Odaenathus approached Shapur I of Persia to request him to guarantee Palmyrene interests in Persia, but was rebuffed. In 260 the Emperor Valerian fought Shapur at the Battle of Edessa, but was defeated and captured. One of Valerian's officers, Macrianus Major, his sons Quietus and Macrianus, and the prefect Balista rebelled against Valerian's son Gallienus, usurping imperial power in Syria.|$|E
