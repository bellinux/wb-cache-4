(4) The weighted mean of exergy efficiencies range from 26. 41 % to 26. 62 %, which are less than the conventional efficiency 28 %, due to the irreversibility of exergy loss.

A comparison is drawn between a grid-connected HRES and a standard grid operation focusing on environmental and economic impacts. Emissions and the renewable energy generation fraction (RF) of <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption</b> are <b>calculated</b> as the main environmental indicator.

40|$|Objective : To {{study the}} {{antimicrobial}} (AM) consumption, record the AM sensitivity pattern, and evaluate impact of "Reserve AM indent form" {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU). Materials and Methods : The study was carried out in medical ICU over 4 months period at a tertiary care hospital. AM consumption was determined by defined daily dose (DDD) per 100 bed days for each month for consecutive 4 months. The average <b>total</b> AM <b>consumption</b> was <b>calculated.</b> The laboratory samples were processed, and the sensitivity pattern was determined. Some of the newer AM were categorised as "Reserve" and an indent form was made mandatory to be filled up prior to prescription. Results : The <b>total</b> AM <b>consumption</b> was 232 per 100 bed days. The commonly used AM were penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor (21 &#x 0025;) followed by antifungal drugs (13. 4 &#x 0025;), cephalosporins and macrolides (11. 7 &#x 0025;) each. The most common organism isolated was Acinetobacter (26. 1 &#x 0025;) followed by Candida (23. 8 &#x 0025;) and Pseudomonas (21. 4 &#x 0025;). The average occupancy index was 0. 53, and the average duration of ICU stay was 6 days. The consumption of carbapenems (new AM) and antifungals decreased from 18. 8 / 100 to 10. 6 / 100 and 56. 1 / 100 to 22. 1 / 100 bed days, respectively, after the introduction of indent form. Conclusion : The "Reserve AM indent form" was helpful in reducing the AM consumption during the study period. The AM indent form can be used as an important tool to combat irrational use, AM resistance and can be implemented in AM stewardship programmes...|$|R
30|$|To get a {{clear idea}} about the {{gasoline}} savings of electric vehicles, we will start by <b>calculating</b> the gasoline <b>consumption</b> in conventional vehicles based on EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data [11]. The average fuel consumption of conventional vehicles ranges from 18 MpG (7.7  km/L) to 25 MpG (10.6  km/L). For easy comparison with the urban vehicle model proposed above, we can safely assume that vehicles drive on average 20, 000 miles (32187  km) per year (given the 60 mile/ 97  km daily mileage). The gasoline consumption thus, ranges from 800 to 1100  gal (3028 to 4164  L) per year. For an average gasoline price of $ 3 /gal, fuel savings range from $ 2400 to $ 3300 per year. Of course, these gasoline savings imply an increase in electricity consumption for charging the batteries of electric vehicles. Field tests indicate that the energy consumption of modern urban EVs varies from 0.2 to 0.3  kWh/mile (0.12 to 0.19  kWh/km) [2, 12, 13] so, the <b>total</b> electricity <b>consumption</b> is <b>calculated</b> to be from 4000 to 6000  kWh per year. Therefore, for the current average electricity US price of 10 cents per kWh [14], EV electricity consumption per year ranges from $ 400 to $ 600. It {{is obvious that the}} annual fuel cost of an urban electric vehicle is about 6 times less than a gasoline one.|$|R

30|$|In [31], an {{optimization}} scheme {{based on}} adaptive modulation and power control for a green routing protocol is used. In order to find the energy consumption of the data packet transmission, the energy consumption per bit for transmitting these packets is calculated. The derived equation demonstrates that the transmit power depends on {{the distance between the}} transmitter and the receiver. M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) provides better spectral efficiency, and the M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (M-FSK) warrants power efficiency. Using M-FSK is the most optimum solution for sensor networks because it requires the least circuit complexity, and for a given symbol error rate (SER), it needs less transmitted power. Based on this, the non-coherent M-FSK (NC M-FSK) is selected for modulation. <b>Total</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is <b>calculated</b> based on two energy spending reasons. The first reason is due to the RF signal generation and target distance. The second one is due to the hardware electronic components. In the network model, each node is stationary and knows its location by using GPS. The IEEE 802.15. 4 standard is taken as a reference, and the ISM band is assumed for operating the modulation schemes. For evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm over the multi-hop route, two scenarios are chosen: without optimization of power and modulation order and with optimization of power and modulation order. In the simulations, the impact of route length is analyzed. According to results, using maximum power while transmitting at a fixed rate causes the largest energy consumption. With optimization, the system achieves significant energy gains.|$|R
