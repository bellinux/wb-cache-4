5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa.

5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory in April of that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – as a result of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E

5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to find that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>the</b> extrudated catalysts increased with the carbon content, therefore, is the pore volume, whose diameters tends to be stable. <b>The</b> increase of <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and pore volume would favour the odour and organic compounds absorption over the catalyst, which can be converted by the active component.

5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> {{of the inner}} {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E
5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
5|$|This pumping {{project was}} {{designed}} to increase <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the Great Salt Lake, and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. The pumps drove some of {{the water of the}} Great Salt Lake into the 320,000-acre (1300-square kilometer) Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike {{at the southern end of}} the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

In this paper, based {{on the concept of}} the dual Orlicz mixed volume, we extend <b>the</b> dual geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> to <b>the</b> Orlicz version and give its properties. In addition, the isoperimetric inequality, a Blaschke-Santaló type inequality, and the monotonicity inequality for the dual Orlicz geominimal <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> are established.|$|R

5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds.

These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E
