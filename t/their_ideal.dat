5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> body weight.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} Como's {{popularity}} came in 1956, when Life conducted {{a poll of}} young women, asking them which man in public life most fit the concept of <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> husband: it was Perry Como. A 1958 nationwide poll of U.S. teenagers found Perry Como {{to be the most}} popular male singer, beating Elvis Presley, who was the winner of the previous year's poll. At one point, his television show was broadcast in at least 12 other countries.|$|E

5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration {{of what might have}} happened. It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 9November, about 150 councillors {{gathered}} for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted {{the leaders of the}} SPD and USPD political parties, who had been invited to the meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, which for the time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in Württemberg.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E

25|$|Weight loss is {{one such}} method.

25|$|In October 2006, Common Sense Media {{released}} {{a white paper}} compiled from existing research on body image perceptions in kids and teens.

25|$|The {{essence of}} deep-rooted spirit lore is that {{supposed}} spirits {{of one kind or}} another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like fairies move through the physical landscape along special routes. In <b>their</b> <b>ideal,</b> pristine form, at least, such routes are conceived of as being straight, having something in common with ley lines. By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. labyrinths and mazes.|$|E

25|$|A fennec fox's typical den is dug in sand, {{either in}} open areas or places {{sheltered}} by plants with stable sand dunes {{considered to be}} <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> habitat.

In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber.|$|E
25|$|The Presbyterian system, {{even more}} rigid {{than that of}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud and the other bishops, whom few on either side except Charles himself supported, seemed destined for {{replacement}} by the Independents and by <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> of free conscience. But for a generation before the war broke out, the system had disciplined and trained the middle classes of the nation (who furnished the bulk of the rebel infantry, and later, of the cavalry also) to centre their will on the attainment of their ideals. The ideals changed during the struggle, but not the capacity for striving for them, and the men capable of the effort finally came to the front, and imposed their ideals on the rest by the force of their trained wills.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge and Southey {{came up with}} a {{theoretical}} political government named Pantisocracy. Originally named Pantocracy, the system was intended be a perfect, egalitarian society formed in America. Poole discussed <b>their</b> <b>ideal</b> government during their visit, and had hope for what the system would accomplish. However, Poole thought that the system would have little chance for succeeding, and he advised Coleridge and Southey that there would be problems regarding females and marriage contracts within the society. As plans were developed, they formed a group of people that would become part of the society, including Southey's mother, Southey's fiancee and her family, and a few others that they knew. Coleridge and Southey also encouraged the group to study agriculture and carpentry to help with the settlement.|$|E
