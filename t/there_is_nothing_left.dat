5|$|The promotional {{tour for}} the album {{included}} both rock shows in stadiums and acoustic gigs in smaller venues. Reviews for In Your Honor were mostly positive, praising {{the composition and}} sound, although some critics found the album overlong and inconsistent. The album was also nominated for five Grammy Awards, and topped the charts in five countries—including Australia—and reached the top five in five more, including number two in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In Your Honor also broke the band's consecutive streak of Grammy Award for Best Rock Album wins that began in 1999 with <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Left</b> to Lose.|$|E

Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.|$|E

25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{were the}} first colonists to settle in Colombo; {{establishing}} a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island.

POTNR boundaries delineate areas within the Study and Core Area(s) that still retain integrity and {{remain to be}} preserved. The Study and Core Area boundaries define the historic landscape of the battlefield while areas that retain integrity define the modern landscape. For example, if a particular farm field was important during the battle but now is covered by a housing development, {{it would still be}} included in a Core or Study Area boundary because the farm field informs the history of the battle. That same farm field, however, would not be considered for inclusion in an POTNR boundary because it no longer has integrity (i.e. conveys a sense of the historic scene) and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> of the original farm field to preserve.|$|E

A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on the backyard, and a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room.

500|$|Following the {{extended}} tour promoting <b>There</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Left</b> to Lose, which kept the Foo Fighters {{mostly on the}} road between 1999 and 2001, the band started to compose songs for their next album in early 2001.

In August, after performing in Chelmsford's V Festival, Hawkins suffered a heroin overdose that left him in a coma for two days. After taking time off to recover, during which frontman Dave Grohl accepted an offer to play drums for the Queens of the Stone Age on their album Songs for the Deaf, the band got together in October 2001 to continue composition. During November and December, they had been recording at Grohl's Studio 606 in Alexandria, Virginia, working with both the producer for their previous album, Adam Kasper, and recording engineer Nick Raskulinecz, whom they met after he had engineered [...] "A320" [...] for [...] Raskulinecz had just left his job at Sound City Studios, and speculated that Grohl, having found difficulty in 'finding a guy [...] who would commit to sitting in his basement for four months', picked him for his energetic and enthusiastic nature.|$|E
