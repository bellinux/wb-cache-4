5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it.

And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|E
5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century in at least <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> Independent School District {{was formed}} in May 1945 by the {{consolidation}} of Goodland Consolidated Independent School District No. 7, Watson Independent School District No. 10, and Wilson Independent County Line School District No. 14. <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> School was built on a 20 acre parcel of land north of Maple. Over the years, several smaller districts - including Stegall (1946) and Bula (1975) - consolidated with <b>Three</b> <b>Way.</b> By the 1994-1995 school year, the district enrolled 127 students. That figure had fallen to 83 by 2001. Faced with declining enrollment and lower funding from the state, <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> administrators decided that the district would have to consolidate with another larger school district {{by the start of}} the next school year. Three neighboring districts - Morton, Muleshoe, and Sudan - were considered for consolidation. A questionnaire was sent to <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD parents and registered voters to see which of the candidate districts was most favored. Sudan ISD was selected by approximately 57 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> voters and 59 percent of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> parents. Both school boards approved the decision and the issue was put to a vote on February 2, 2002. In the election, Sudan ISD voters supported consolidation by a 190-1 margin. Of the 80 votes cast by <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD residents, 54 supported the measure with 26 opposed. The merger of <b>Three</b> <b>Way</b> ISD with Sudan became official on July 1, 2002.|$|R

5|$|Geologists have dated and {{documented}} dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation. Historical lava {{flows from the}} volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount {{that had not yet}} breached the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch that kept the vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it {{still needs to be}} studied.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack of}} myelin starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split <b>three</b> <b>ways,</b> with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b> Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E

5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split <b>three</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|E
5|$|The feud between Samoa Joe and Booker T ended after Hard Justice. On the August14 {{episode of}} TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced}} that Joe would defend the championship at TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on September14 in a Four Ways to Glory match. Cornette stated {{that over the}} weeks leading to the show three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe. Booker T won the first qualifying match was on the August21 episode of Impact! by defeating Rhino. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August28 episode of Impact! {{to qualify for the}} contest. The final qualifier was Christian Cage, who defeated A.J. Styles on the September4 episode of Impact!. Booker T could not attend the event due to Hurricane Ike, making the bout a <b>Three</b> <b>Ways</b> to Glory match instead. Joe retained the championship at the show.|$|E
5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a <b>Three</b> <b>Ways</b> to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
