5|$|Each {{class of}} cadets elects representatives {{to serve as}} class {{president}} and fill several administrative positions. They also elect a ring and crest committee, which designs the class's crest, the emblem that signifies <b>their</b> <b>class</b> and it is embossed upon <b>their</b> <b>class</b> rings. Each class crest is required to contain the initials USMA and <b>their</b> <b>class</b> motto. The class motto is proposed by the class during cadet basic training and voted on by the class prior {{to the beginning of}} their freshman academic year. Class mottos typically have verbiage that rhymes or is phonetically similar with <b>their</b> <b>class</b> year.|$|E

5|$|The FSU Young Scholars Program is a {{competitive}} residential {{science and mathematics}} program for 40 Florida high-school students with potential for careers in the sciences, engineering, and health professions. Admission to the FSU YSP generally requires completing the eleventh grade and scoring at least 90% on a national standardized examination such as the SAT or PSAT. The PSAT math average is approximately 96% and the PSAT verbal average is approximately 94%.

5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in <b>their</b> <b>class</b> and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E

5|$|Architecture, {{sculpture}} and painting developed also under Italian influence {{from the beginning}} of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Kraków. Francesco Fiorentino worked on the tomb of Jan Olbracht already from 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle, which was accomplished between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Kraków merchants (by the mid 16th century <b>their</b> <b>class</b> economically gained strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residencies to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Kraków's Sukiennice and Poznań City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades.|$|E
5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing <b>their</b> <b>class</b> and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Each unit {{is governed}} by a {{character}} class system, with <b>their</b> <b>class</b> affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.|$|E

5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine <b>their</b> <b>class</b> effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
5|$|Like most RPGs, the Final Fantasy {{installments}} use {{an experience}} level system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. Character classes, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced {{in the first}} game, character classes have been used differently in each title. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside <b>their</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, skills, and abilities. The player then determines <b>their</b> <b>class</b> in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E
