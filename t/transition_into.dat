5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that afternoon, {{as the storm}} moved northward into Georgia. It weakened to a tropical depression {{on the evening of}} June 5 over southern Georgia. Early on June 6, Allison began to <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> an extratropical storm as it interacted with a warm front to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Hatteras that evening. It then raced across the western Atlantic, crossing the easternmost part of Nova Scotia on June 8 and Newfoundland on June 9. It continued northward across the Labrador Sea, dissipating on June 11.|$|E

5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> the public school system.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating.

5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> an extratropical cyclone within five days, due to conditions unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Guillermo's central {{pressure}} of 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg) established {{it as the}} second most intense Pacific hurricane on record behind Hurricane Ava of 1973. However, later in the 1997 season, Hurricane Linda set a new intensity record, and in subsequent years hurricanes Kenna, Ioke, Rick, Marie, Odile and Patricia all achieved lower pressures, leaving Guillermo in ninth place. Guillermo persisted for 16.5 days from its classification as a tropical depression to its <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> an extratropical storm, making it the sixth longest-lasting storm in the basin.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> the last ten bars.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines {{has been}} the focus of several {{television}} programs in Japan over the years, most being dramas revolving around cabin attendants. Attention Please was a drama in 1970 that followed the story of a young girl who joins JAL to be a cabin attendant while overcoming many difficulties. This show was remade in 2006 again as Attention Please starring Aya Ueto who joins a class of cabin attendant nominees and later graduates. Most of the action of the story of the 2006 series takes place at JAL's Haneda flight operations headquarters. The series has had two specials since the original, marking the main character's <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> JAL's international operations.|$|E

The final named storm was meteorologically significant in that it became the first recorded tropical cyclone to <b>transition</b> <b>into</b> a subtropical cyclone. No names were retired during the season; however, due to the addition of male names into the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 1979, several of the names were removed and have not been used since.|$|E
