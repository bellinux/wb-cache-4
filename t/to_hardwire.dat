50|$|Some modern CPUs and {{microcontrollers}} (for example, TI OMAP) {{or sometimes}} even DSPs may have boot ROM with boot code integrated directly into their silicon, so such a processor could perform quite a sophisticated boot sequence {{on its own}} and load boot programs from various sources like NAND flash, SD or MMC card and so on. It is difficult <b>to</b> <b>hardwire</b> all the required logic for handling such devices, so an integrated boot ROM is used instead in such scenarios. Boot ROM usage enables more flexible boot sequences than hardwired logic could provide. For example, the boot ROM could try to perform boot from multiple boot sources. Also, a boot ROM is often able to load a boot loader or diagnostic program via serial interfaces like UART, SPI, USB and so on. This feature is often used for system recovery purposes when for some reasons usual boot software in non-volatile memory got erased, and {{it could also be}} used for initial non-volatile memory programming when there is clean non-volatile memory installed and hence no software available in the system yet.|$|E

Here we use the MARCM method⁵ to perform a systematic clonal analysis of projection neurons, allowing us to correlate lineage and birth time of projection neurons with their glomerular choice. We demonstrate that projection neurons are prespecified by lineage and birth order to form synapses with specific incoming ORN axons, and therefore to carry specific olfactory information. This prespecification could be used <b>to</b> <b>hardwire</b> the fly's olfactory system, enabling stereotyped behavioural responses to odorants.

But there is no clear definition of smart city (Nam & Pardo, 2011; Neirotti, Cagliano, Mangano, & Scorrano, 2014). Hollands (2008) stated smart city as an “urban labeling” phenomenon. Researchers tried to define smart city in different aspects, such as dimensions of technology, people, and institutions (Nam & Pardo, 2011). The typical technology-oriented definition was “an instrumented, interconnected and intelligent city” by Harrison et al. from IBM (Harrison et al., 2010). Another definition of smart city was people-oriented. Paskaleva (2011) viewed smart cities as “people-based, human and progressive in their deployment of digital technologies, not <b>to</b> <b>hardwire</b> themselves, but instead to be socially inclusive in using them to foster good governance and create services capable of improving the quality of life.” Finally, the governance-oriented definition of smart city refers to the administrative and organizational aspects of the city. Relatively, smart city is a new concept and new mode to promote the wisdom of urban planning, construction, management, and service by using the Internet, cloud computing, big data, geospatial information integration and other new generation information technology (National Development and Reform Commission, 2014). In general, smart city is under a widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), which help cities better utilize the resources in different urban domains (Neirotti, Cagliano, Mangano, & Scorrano, 2014). In the Dual-core framework of smart cities, proposed by Huang et al. (2015), the construction of smart cities on the micro level focuses on creating environment livable for the citizens, while on the macro level focuses on creating innovative developing environment, which are the two cores of smart cities’ construction. Advocating “smart learning” plays a cultural leading role for stimulating vitality for urban innovation, and it also provides scientific support for citizens’ livable experiences (Huang et al., 2015).|$|E

Respiratory devices can cause hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU). The damage can cause pain, increase infection risk, lead to scarring and may require surgical repair. These injuries are classified as “never” events by Medicare and are reported which can subject the organization to financial penalties. In 2014 our incidence of HAPU secondary to endotracheal tubes and stabilization devices was 0. 79 / 1000 ventilator days which increased in 2015 to 1. 72 / 1000 ventilator days. There was {{a significant increase in}} patient case mix index documenting the increase in patient acuity between 2014 and 2015. The baseline measurement for 2014 and 2015 was 1. 31 HAPU/ 1000 ventilator days. Define measure, analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC) performance improvement methodology was utilized by a multidisciplinary team to address this challenge. Improvement initiatives implemented included process standardization with visual cues and electronic prompts, multimedia education, dermal rounding, process auditing with peer coaching, return demonstration competency assessments, cross discipline training and defined quality metrics tied to employee performance pay. All improvement initiatives were implemented over a two month period. The team goal was to reduce dermal breakdown by 50 % over the baseline and have a 90 % process compliance rate. Both goals were achieved. Significant improvement resulted with the HAPU rate decreasing from 1. 31 to 0. 44 / 1000 ventilator days during the eight month period following the implementation phase.

There are two natural measures of the cost of this mapping, namely the dilation cost, i. e., the maximum distance in the target binary tree between the images of vertices that are adjacent in the original tree. The other measure, expansion cost, is defined as the number of extra nodes/edges {{to be added to the}} target binary tree in order to ensure a 1 - 1 mapping. An efficient algorithm to find a mapping of one binary tree onto another is described. It is shown that it is possible to minimize one cost of mapping at the expense of the other. This problem arises when designing pipelined arithmetic logic units (ALU) for special purpose computers. The pipeline is composed of ALU chips connected in the form of a binary tree. The operands to the pipeline can be supplied to the leaf nodes of the binary tree which then process and pass the results up to their parents. The final result is available at the root. As each new application may require a distinct nesting of operations, it is useful to be able to find a good mapping of a new binary tree over existing ALU tree. Another problem arises if every distinct required binary tree is known beforehand.
