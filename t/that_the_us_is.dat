5|$|Starting with {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh discusses the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> funding {{both sides of}} the conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E
5|$|Woodward asserts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists {{and that this}} program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E
25|$|An Al Qaeda video {{released}} in September 2009 appears to contain video clips of Idema torturing an Afghan by dunking {{his head in}} a bucket of water. This footage was used to make the case <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> involved in torture in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|A Washington-based {{think tank}} has claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> {{supportive}} of India's efforts to close missile gap with China and is {{comfortable with the}} progress being made by New Delhi in this regard. Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia, and Baker Spring, research fellow in National Security Policy, at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank said in a commentary, “The lack of US condemnation of India's latest missile test demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> comfortable with Indian progress in the nuclear and missile fields and appreciates India's need to meet the emerging strategic challenge posed by rising China.” “It is telling that no country has criticised India's missile test,” the US experts wrote. “The US change in position with regard to Indian missile capabilities demonstrates how far the US-India relationship has evolved over the last decade,” Curtis and Spring said.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{federal budget}} {{comprises}} the spending and revenues of the US federal government. The budget is the financial {{representation of the}} priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies. The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects. It has reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> facing a series of long-term financial challenges, as the country ages and healthcare costs continue growing faster than the economy.|$|E
25|$|The term weaponization {{of finance}} {{refers to the}} foreign policy {{strategy}} of using incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. In his Eurasia Group Top Risks 2015 report, Bremmer coins the weaponization of finance to describe {{the ways in which}} the United States is using its influence to affect global outcomes. Rather than rely on traditional elements of America’s security advantage – including US-led alliances such as NATO and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund – Bremmer argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> now ‘weaponizing finance’ by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy.|$|E
50|$|In May 2009 it <b>was</b> {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>was</b> sharing drone intelligence with Pakistan. Leon Panetta reiterated on 19 May 2009 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> {{intended to}} continue the drone attacks.|$|R
2500|$|A 1985 {{report by}} the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>was</b> [...] "profoundly involved and benefited greatly" [...] from the treaty.|$|R

25|$|Following the 1967 war, Israeli {{settlements}} also existed within Egyptian {{territory in}} the Sinai Peninsula, and within the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip; however, Israel evacuated the Sinai settlements following the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace agreement and from the Gaza Strip in 2005 under Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. Israel dismantled 18 settlements in the Sinai Peninsula in 1982, while in 2005 all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled, but only four in the West Bank. In the West Bank, however, Israel continues to expand its remaining settlements as well as settling new areas, despite pressure {{from the international community}} to desist. According to the Israeli investigative reporter Uri Blau, settlements received funding by private tax-exempt U.S. NGOs of $220 million for 2009–2013, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> indirectly subsidizing their creation.|$|E
500|$|The {{final section}} of the book, removed in later editions, {{consists}} of a single chapter regarding the study of literature. Wellek and Warren bemoan that literary students are [...] "offered no wider choice than between the 'historical method'... and dilettantism", supporting instead a critically oriented literary scholarship. After finding faults with the literary scholarship in England, Germany, France, and Russia, Wellek and Warren suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> <b>is</b> poised {{to start a new}} era in scholarship. They note that this opportunity may, however, be lost in a conflict between those advocating change and the inertia (including persons defending the status quo) in American literary studies and institutions.|$|E

Made up of the most powerful men in the United States, Soviet Union, and China, they were an Illuminati-like organization who control the world behind the scenes. However, after the end of World War II, they began to fight amongst themselves, and the organization broke down. The Philosopher's Legacy, a fund the organization had jointly amassed to finance their wars ($100 billion), was divided up and hidden in banks all over the world. Volgin had illegally inherited this money, and Snake learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> attempting to retrieve it.|$|E

500|$|Chicago is {{the largest}} American city without mayoral term limits, and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley started his mayoral tenure in 1989. [...] Jackson held press {{conferences}} less frequently than his father. [...] After making a formal announcement in 2006 with a press conference, Jackson was considered a strong potential candidate to oppose Daley in the municipal election on February 27, 2007. [...] He stated on September 7, 2006, that his final decision would come after the Congressional election in November. Jackson had built up a more moderate reputation than his father and had support that transcended racial lines. [...] Jackson views his broad based support as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> advancing {{to the point where}} politicians from ethnic minorities can appeal to broad constituencies.|$|E

Fischer stated that he was happy that the {{airliner}} attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying [...] "I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians... for years." [...] He also said [...] "The horrible behavior <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>is</b> committing all over the world... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States." [...] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., [...] " [...] {{the country will be}} taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders." [...] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.|$|E

She said <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>was</b> also spending {{millions of dollars to}} aid Pakistan's capacity building through renovation and repair of the Tarbela dam and others that would add over 500MW to the national grid. [...] "There is no short-term solution to end the gap between electricity consumption and generation, which was currently around 5,000MW," [...] she said, adding that things would better during the years to come should Pakistan start work on power generation projects. Dismissing <b>the</b> notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>was</b> only giving all this assistance to change public perception in Pakistan as inaccurate, she stated that [...] "The US wants to help Pakistan meet its energy needs. The process of assistance was started years ago on public request. Before <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> had <b>been</b> providing only military assistance to Pakistan." ...|$|R
