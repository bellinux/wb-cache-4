Although a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of attempting to flee underwater {{to the point of}} exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing whaleboats on the surface, particularly if it had already been wounded by repeated harpooning attempts.

The Dalek's response—evaporating the paintball and replying [...] "My vision is not impaired!"—was added after Cook reminded Davies it was [...] "obligatory" [...] <b>to</b> <b>invert</b> the recurring phrase spoken when a Dalek was blinded ("Vision impaired!"), and remove a weakness the Daleks had exhibited since their first appearance in the 1963–1964 serial The Daleks.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Famitsu, Naora described that the game was generally {{designed to be a}} [...] "bright, fresh Final Fantasy." [...] The main reason was that the team had dealt extensively with dark and [...] "weird" [...] imagry with VII. The designers felt a need <b>to</b> <b>invert</b> the atmosphere of previous games in the series, which had feelings of [...] "light emerging from darkness". This decision was easy for the developers to make, because most of them had worked on Final Fantasy VII and felt that a new direction was acceptable. The world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to computer graphics, which was not the case with Final Fantasy VII. The developers also noted that with Final Fantasy VIII, they attempted to [...] "mix future, real life and fantasy." [...] As part of a theme desired by Kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from ancient Egyptian and Greek architecture, to the city of Paris, France, to an idealized futuristic European society. Flags were also given to some factions, their designs based on the group's history and culture.|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded that I wish <b>to</b> <b>invert</b> the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God."

40|$|Performance {{comparisons}} between File Signatures and Inverted Files for text retrieval have previously shown several significant shortcomings of file signatures relative <b>to</b> <b>inverted</b> files. The inverted file approach underpins most state-of-the-art search engine algorithms, such as Language and Probabilistic models. It {{has been widely}} accepted that traditional file signatures are inferior alternatives <b>to</b> <b>inverted</b> files. This paper describes TopSig, {{a new approach to}} the construction of file signatures. Many advances in semantic hashing and dimensionality reduction have been made in recent times, but these were not so far linked to general purpose, signature file based, search engines. This paper introduces a different signature file approach that builds upon and extends these recent advances. We are able to demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of signature file based indexing and retrieval, performance that is comparable to that of state of the art inverted file based systems, including Language models and BM 25. These findings suggest that file signatures offer a viable alternative <b>to</b> <b>inverted</b> files in suitable settings and from the theoretical perspective it positions the file signatures model in the class of Vector Space retrieval models.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies suggest}} that {{adaptation}} effects for face shape and gender transfer from upright <b>to</b> <b>inverted</b> faces more than the reverse. We investigated whether a similar asymmetry occurred for face identity, using a recently developed adaptation method based on contrast-recognition thresholds. When adapting and test stimuli shared the same orientation, aftereffects were similar for upright and inverted faces. When orientation differed, there was significant transfer of aftereffects from upright adapting <b>to</b> <b>inverted</b> test faces, but none from <b>inverted</b> <b>to</b> upright faces. We show that asymmetric cross-orientation transfer of face aftereffects generalize across two distinct face adaptation paradigms: the previously used perceptual-bias methodology and the recently introduced contrast-threshold based adaptation paradigm. These results also represent a generalization from aftereffects for face shape and gender to aftereffects for face identity. While these {{results are consistent with}} the dual-mode hypothesis, they can also be accounted for by a single population of units of varying orientation selectivity...|$|R
