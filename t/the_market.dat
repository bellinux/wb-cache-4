5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, {{the maintenance of}} <b>the</b> <b>market</b> cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125. In 2005 {{the base of the}} cross was rediscovered in excavations during renovation of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> floor.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially <b>the</b> <b>market</b> {{remained}} little {{changed in}} the decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed <b>the</b> <b>market</b> to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E

5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> <b>market</b> grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 <b>the</b> <b>market</b> relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms.

5|$|In 1813 {{the yard}} of the King's Head {{coaching}} inn was widened to create Davey Place, a new street between <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and Back of the Inns, {{at that time}} a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns.

Exchange Street, a new road running north from {{the northeast corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath.

In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new neoclassical building.
