25|$|The {{crucifix}} is {{a principal}} symbol for many groups of Christians, {{and one of the}} most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts. It is especially important in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, but is also used in the Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, and Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as by many Lutheran and Anglican churches. The symbol is less common in churches of other Protestant denominations, which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the corpus). The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice — his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than any other shape, such as a <b>Tau</b> <b>cross</b> or a Coptic cross.|$|E

2500|$|Old St. Peter's Basilica was the 4th-century church {{begun by}} the Emperor Constantine the Great between 319 and 333 CE. It was of typical basilical form, a wide nave and two aisles {{on each side}} and an apsidal end, with the {{addition}} of a transept or bema, giving the building the shape of a <b>tau</b> <b>cross.</b> It was over [...] long, and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium. This church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of St. Peter. It contained a very large number of burials and memorials, including those of most of the popes from St. Peter to the 15th century. Like all of the earliest churches in Rome, both this church and its successor had the entrance to the east and the apse at the west end of the building. Since the construction of the current basilica, the name Old St. Peter's Basilica has been used for its predecessor to distinguish the two buildings.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Depression is a {{major problem}} in {{long-term}} care (LTC) as is the lack of related empirically sup-ported psychological treatments. This small study addressed a variant of cognitive behavioral therapy, GIST (group, individual, and staff therapy), against treatment as usual (TAU) in long-term care. Method. 25 residents with depression were randomized to GIST (n 13) or TAU (n 12). Outcome measures included geriatric depression scale-short form (GDS-S), life satisfaction index Z (LSI-Z), and subjective ratings of treatment satisfaction. The GIST group participated in 15 group sessions. <b>TAU</b> <b>crossed</b> over to GIST {{at the end of the}} treatment trial. Results. There were significant differences between GIST and TAU in favor of GIST on the GDS-S and LSI-Z. The GIST group maintained improvements over another 14 sessions. After crossover to GIST, TAU members showed significant improvement from base-line. Participants also reported high subjective ratings of treatment satisfaction. Discussion. This trial demonstrated GIST to be more effective for depression in LTC than standard treatments...|$|R
2500|$|In his Problem of the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{analyzed}} the four then known {{copies of the}} missal, along with a fifth shorter version. He reported that surviving copies of the book contained several [...] "runs", i.e., a number of consecutive gatherings of paper, with the same three watermarks (including their twins), a cross on mounts and two different bull's heads under a <b>Tau</b> <b>cross.</b> Stevenson identified several states of these watermarks in the book, reflecting {{the aging of the}} watermark as stress was repeatedly applied to the screen in making the paper. He identified the same watermarks in other books which included their dates of printing or were otherwise firmly datable. In fact, some of those books contained both the identical cross on mounts and identical bull's head watermarks. Moreover, he traced the deteriorating states of the bull's head watermarks through a number of dated or datable books, thereby determining the relationship between a particular state of the watermark with the date of the book, and through that analysis, to identify the date of the watermark {{on the basis of its}} condition. Through this information, Stevenson precisely dated the printing of the Missale Speciale to the fall of 1473. Bibliographers now accept this proof that the missal was printed in 1473 as [...] "conclusive." ...|$|E

Using a hybrid emulsion-spectrometer detector, the tau lepton was identified by its single- prong or trident decay. Six interactions were observed, of which five were in the deep inelastic scattering region. These five interaction were used to measure the charged-current cross section of the tau neutrino. To minimize uncertainties, the <b>tau</b> neutrino <b>cross</b> section was measured relative to the electron neutrino cross section.

40|$|AbstractThe {{result of}} a search for heavy {{long-lived}} charged particles produced in pp collisions at s= 7 TeV at the LHC is described. The data sample has been collected using the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5. 0 fb− 1. The inner tracking detectors are used to define a sample of events containing tracks with high momentum and high ionization energy loss. A second sample of events, which have high-momentum tracks satisfying muon identification requirements in addition to meeting high-ionization and long time-of-flight requirements, is analyzed independently. In both cases, the {{results are consistent with}} the expected background estimated from data. The results are used to establish cross section limits as a function of mass within the context of models with long-lived gluinos, scalar top quarks and scalar <b>taus.</b> <b>Cross</b> section limits on hyper-meson particles, containing new elementary long-lived hyper-quarks predicted by a vector-like confinement model, are also presented. Lower limits at 95 % confidence level on the mass of gluinos (scalar top quarks) are found to be 1098 (737) GeV/c 2. A limit of 928 (626) GeV/c 2 is set for a gluino (scalar top quark) that hadronizes into a neutral bound state before reaching the muon detectors. The lower mass limit for a pair produced scalar tau is found to be 223 GeV/c 2.
