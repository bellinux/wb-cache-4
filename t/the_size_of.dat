40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and of the nonpathogenic species Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were compared in the phyllosphere of bean. In general, the plant pathogens survived better than the nonpathogens on leaves under environmental stress. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains were greater than <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations of the nonpathogens under dry conditions but not under moist conditions. In these studies the surface sterilants hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation were used to differentiate cells that were fully exposed on the surface from nonexposed cells that were in “protected sites” that were inaccessible to these agents. In general, <b>the</b> population <b>sizes</b> in protected sites increased with time after inoculation of plants. The proportion of bacteria on leaves that were in protected sites was generally greater for pathogens than for nonpathogens and was greater under dry conditions than under moist conditions. When organisms were vacuum infiltrated into leaves, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexposed “internal” populations were greater for pathogenic P. syringae strains than for nonpathogenic P. syringae strains. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations of the nonpathogenic species failed to increase or even decreased. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed populations following spray inoculation were correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> nonexposed, internal populations which developed after vacuum infiltration and incubation. While <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains increased on leaves under dry conditions, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations of the nonpathogenic strains of P. syringae, P. agglomerans, and S. maltophilia decreased when the organisms were applied to plants. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populations on dry leaves were also correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonexposed populations that developed following vacuum infiltration.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> {{galaxies are}} known to be closely related with their masses, luminosities, redshifts and morphologies. However, when we fix these {{quantities}} and morphology, we still find large dispersions in <b>the</b> galaxy <b>size</b> distribution. We investigate the origin of these dispersions for red early-type galaxies, using two SDSS-based catalogs. We find that <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> faint galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) - 19. 5, where M_r is the r-band absolute magnitude, k-corrected to z = 0. 1) are affected more significantly by luminosity, while <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> bright galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) > 11. 4 or M_r < - 21. 4) are by dynamical mass. At fixed mass and luminosity, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> low-mass galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 45 and M_r ~ - 19. 8) are relatively less sensitive to their colors, color gradients and axis ratios. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> intermediate-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10. 85 and M_r ~ - 20. 4) and high-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 11. 25 and M_r ~ - 21. 0) galaxies significantly depend on those parameters, in the sense that larger red early-type galaxies have bluer colors, more negative color gradients (bluer outskirts) and smaller axis ratios. These results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> intermediate- and high-mass red early-type galaxies are significantly affected by their recent minor mergers or rotations, whereas <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> low-mass red early-type galaxies are affected by some other mechanisms.

5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIMPORTANCE In 1939, English mathematician, geneticist, and {{psychiatrist}} Lionel Sharples Penrose {{hypothesized that}} the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations were inversely related; 75 years later, the question arises {{as to whether the}} hypothesis applies to recent developments in South America. OBJECTIVE To explore the possible association of changes in the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds with changes in <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations in South America since 1990. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched primary sources for the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds in South American countries since 1990 (the year that the Latin American countries signed the Caracas Declaration) and compared these changes against <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. <b>The</b> associations between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations were tested using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables were considered as covariates. Sufficiently reliable and complete data were obtained from 6 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. On average, the removal of 1 bed was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate. The association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations remained practically unchanged when income inequality was considered as a covariate (- 4. 28 [95 % CI, - 5. 21 to - 3. 36]; P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds have substantially decreased in South America, while <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison populations have increased against a background of strong economic growth. The changes appear to be associated because the numbers of beds decreased more extensively when and where <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations increased. These findings are consistent with and specify the assumption of an association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> prison populations. More research is needed to understand the drivers of the capacities of psychiatric hospitals and prisons and to explore reasons for their associatio...|$|R
