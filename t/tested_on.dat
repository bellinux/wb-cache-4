5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> a number of lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E

Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never <b>tested</b> <b>on</b> the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E

All three tests can be easily implemented through a nonlinear least squares procedure. Simulation results show that, in terms of finite sample performance, the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> expected information is the best, followed by the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> Hessian and then the LM <b>test</b> based <b>on</b> gradient.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine {{can improve}} {{specificity}} in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and could prevent unnecessary prostate biopsies. In this study, we evaluated the PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid and compared {{this with the}} PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine in a clinical research setting. METHODS: Prostatic fluid and urine samples from 67 men were collected following digital rectal examination (DRE). The sediments were analyzed using the quantitative APTIMA PCA 3 test. The results were compared with prostate biopsy results. RESULTS: Using a PCA 3 score of 66 as a cut-off value, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid had 65 % sensitivity {{for the detection of}} PCa, 82 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 82 %. At a cut-off value of 43, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine had 61 % sensitivity, 80 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 80 %.
