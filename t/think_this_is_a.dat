People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's really interesting, and she still wants Lydia to go down!" [...] The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer.

In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it."
