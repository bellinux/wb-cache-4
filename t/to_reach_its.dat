5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong southerly shear {{exposing the}} LLCC, Bonnie {{intensified}} slightly <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> initial peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h) {{as it turned}} towards the north. However, the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone's appearance to significantly degrade early on May29, as deep convection dissipated due to more than 46mph (74km/h) of southerly shear. Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength {{about half an hour}} prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. Caught in weak steering currents, the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 12:00UTC on May30.|$|E
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> customers, {{it had to}} be {{harvested}} from ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in domestic or commercial applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E

North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one-way eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, where the state highway turns west <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> northern terminus at MD 528.

Shortly after entering Brazilian airspace, the Brazilian Air Force sent two Northrop F-5s to escort the British plane until it landed on Galeão Air Force Base. This led to high-level diplomatic talks between the UK and Brazil, which remained neutral during the Falklands War. After seven days of detainment, the Vulcan and its crew were allowed to return home {{on the condition that}} XM597 played no further part in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|On July2, 1935, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge {{over the}} Hudson River between Catskill and Greenport was opened to traffic.

Plans {{were made in the}} early 1950s to construct a southern bypass of the city of Hudson between the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and NY23 midway between Claverack and Hollowville. Construction on the portion of the highway between the bridge and US9 south of Hudson began in the mid-1950s and was completed in the late 1950s as a realignment of NY23. Ultimately, this was the only section that was built; as a result, NY23 overlapped with US9 and NY9H <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> former alignment in Claverack.|$|E

5|$|The three Eubalaena species inhabit three {{distinct}} {{areas of the}} globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to Alaska and {{all areas of the}} Southern Ocean. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups with minor exclusions. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer to stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.|$|E

With this new talent, in his first season in charge, Chapman led Northampton to eighth place; with additional new signings, such as inside forward Albert Lewis from Coventry City, he used this as a springboard to take the Southern League title in 1908–09, with Lewis finishing as top scorer.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil (RSMC Nadi designation: 06F, JTWC designation: 07P) {{was a short}} lived {{storm of}} January 2006 that explosively {{intensified}} <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity as a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale, just 12hours after being named. Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January14, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly.

However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center. By January15, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before dissipating. Urmil had only minor effects on land; scattered vegetation damage was reported in Tonga.|$|E
