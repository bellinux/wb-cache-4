5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the <b>transform</b> <b>fault.</b> If the <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly flow upward into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} California's most seismically active regions and, in a 50-year period, the area {{including}} the Mendocino Fracture Zone at the southern flank of the Gorda Plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in the state. The Mendocino Triple Junction (strike-slip/strike-slip/trench) formed 29–30 mya at 31° N (west of present-day Baja California) when the Pacific-Farallon spreading center initially approached the subduction zone {{off the coast of}} western North America. Simultaneously, the Rivera Triple Junction shifted to the southeast to its current position at 23° N. Once the Pacific Plate and North American Plate connected the boundary became that of a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> (San Andreas) due to the northwestward motion of the Pacific Plate relative to the North American Plate. The San Andreas Fault continues to lengthen to the northwest and the southeast as the two triple junctions continue their transient motion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Transform</b> <b>faults</b> {{are closely}} related to transcurrent faults, and are {{commonly}} confused. Both types of faults are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; however, <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> end at the junction of another plate boundary or fault type, while transcurrent faults die out without a junction. In addition, <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> have equal deformation across the entire fault line, while transcurrent faults have greater displacement {{in the middle of the}} fault zone and less on the margins. Finally, <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> can form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent faults cannot.|$|R
50|$|Between 88°E and 118°E {{there are}} nine <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> {{offsetting}} the SEIR 21-135 km or an age of 0.5-3.6 Ma, accompanied by eight first-order segments (older than 5 Ma) and five east-migrating rifts. These <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> and migrating rifts are located were the SEIR reaches its maximum axial depths. The first-order <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> are off-set 2-17 km by 19 non-transform discontinuities, resulting in 18-180 km-long second-order segments. The flanks of the SEIR are dominated by fracture zones perpendicular to the ridge and gravitational lineations oblique to the spreading direction and sometimes zigzag-shaped. This suggests that the SEIR evolves rapidly {{within the framework of}} the stable <b>transform</b> <b>faults.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Dead Sea is an endorheic lake {{located in}} the Jordan Rift Valley, a {{geographic}} feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and {{the northern end of}} the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.

25|$|The DST fault {{system is}} {{generally}} considered to be a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> that has accommodated a 105km northwards displacement of the Arabian Plate. This interpretation is based on observation of offset markers, such as river terraces, gullies and archaeological features, giving horizontal slip rates of several mm per year over the last few million years. GPS data give similar rates of present-day movement of the Arabian Plate relative to the Africa Plate. It has also been proposed that the fault zone is a rift system that is an incipient oceanic spreading center, the northern extension of the Red Sea Rift.|$|E

The tsunami claimed more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern Europe.

50|$|The {{effect of}} a fault is to relieve strain, which {{can be caused by}} compression, extension, or lateral stress in the rock layers at the surface or deep in the Earth’s subsurface. <b>Transform</b> <b>faults</b> {{specifically}} relieve strain by transporting the strain between ridges or subduction zones. <b>Transform</b> <b>faults</b> also act as the plane of weakness allowing for the splitting in rift zones.|$|R
40|$|Oceanic <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> and ridge {{segments}} form {{a network}} where mechanical interaction {{is to be}} expected. In particular, dike emplacement in ridge segments is likely to affect earthquake activity in the adjacent <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> through processes such as stress transfer. Similarly, strike-slip displacement across <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> may trigger dike injections and, eventually, eruptions in the adjacent ridge segments. For obvious reasons, direct observations of the possible mechanical interaction between submarine transform zones and ridge segments at mid-ocean ridges are difficult. The subaerial seismic zones of Iceland, however, are in clear spatial connections with the adjacent volcanic zones. These zones, therefore, provide excellent opportunities to study stress transfer between volcanic and seismic zones (Gudmundsson 2000) [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The Cocos Ridge is a 1000km long feature {{located on}} the Cocos plate and is orientated {{parallel}} to the plates motion from the 91 degree west <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> at the Galapagos Spreading Centre towards the Panamanian coast. The north eastern end of the ridge dates from about 13–14.5 million years ago. However, Cocos Island at {{the northern end of}} the ridge is only 2 million years old, and was therefore created at a time well after the ridge had moved away from the hotspot. The presence of a pronounced sedimentary hiatus in sediments on the Cocos Ridge indicates that the Cocos Ridge was probably buckled upon its initial shallow subdution along the Middle American Trench.|$|E
25|$|Polynesia is {{characterized}} by a small amount of land spread over a very large portion of the mid and southern Pacific Ocean. Most Polynesian islands and archipelagos, including the Hawaiian Islands and Samoa, are composed of volcanic islands built by hotspots. New Zealand, Norfolk Island, and Ouvéa, the Polynesian outlier near New Caledonia, are the unsubmerged portions of the largely sunken continent of Zealandia. Zealandia is believed to have mostly sunk 23 million years ago and recently resurfaced geologically due to a change in the movements of the Pacific Plate in relation to the Indo-Australian plate, which served to uplift the New Zealand portion. At first, the Pacific plate was subducted under the Australian plate. The Alpine Fault that traverses the South Island is currently a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> while the convergent plate boundary from the North Island northwards is called the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone. The volcanism associated with this subduction zone is the origin of the Kermadec and Tongan island archipelagos.|$|E
25|$|Widespread basalt {{volcanism}} {{occurred between}} 60.9 and 61.3 {{million years ago}} in the northern Labrador Sea, Davis Strait and in southern Baffin Bay on the eastern coast of Nunavut during the Paleocene period when North America and Greenland were being separated from tectonic movements. This resulted from seafloor spreading where new ocean seafloor was being created from rising magma. Scientific studies have indicated nearly 80% of the magma was erupted in one million years or less. The source for this volcanic activity was the Iceland plume along with its surface expression, the Iceland hotspot. This volcanic activity formed part of a large igneous province that is sunken beneath the northern Labrador Sea. Another period of volcanic activity began in the same region about 55million years ago during the Eocene period when the north-south trending Mid-Atlantic Ridge began to form under the northern Atlantic Ocean east of Greenland. The cause of this volcanism might be related to partial melting from movement of a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> system extending from Labrador Sea to the south and Baffin Bay to the north. Although the region was carried away from the Iceland plume by going plate motion over millions of years, the source of the partial melting for the final period of volcanic activity may have been remnants of still anomalously hot Iceland plume magma which were left stranded beneath the North American lithosphere in the Paleocene period. Most diatremes in the Northwest Territories were formed by volcanic eruptions between 45and 75million years ago during the Eocene and Late Cretaceous periods.|$|E
50|$|John Tuzo Wilson {{recognized}} that the offsets of oceanic ridges by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in Reid’s rebound theory of faulting, from which the sense of slip is derived. The new class of <b>faults,</b> called <b>transform</b> <b>faults,</b> produce slip {{in the opposite direction}} from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature. Slip along <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers. This hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest.|$|R
25|$|Transform {{boundaries}} (Conservative) occur {{where two}} lithospheric plates slide, or perhaps more accurately, grind {{past each other}} along <b>transform</b> <b>faults,</b> where plates are neither created nor destroyed. The relative motion of the two plates is either sinistral (left side toward the observer) or dextral (right side toward the observer). <b>Transform</b> <b>faults</b> occur across a spreading center.

25|$|The Ring of Fire is {{a direct}} result of plate tectonics: the {{movement}} and collisions of lithospheric plates. The eastern section of the ring is the result of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate being subducted beneath the westward-moving South American Plate. The Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate, in Central America. A portion of the Pacific Plate and the small Juan de Fuca Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate. Along the northern portion, the northwestward-moving Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the Aleutian Islands arc. Farther west, the Pacific plate is being subducted along the Kamchatka Peninsula arcs on south past Japan. The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Bougainville, Tonga, and New Zealand; this portion excludes Australia, since it lies in the center of its tectonic plate. Indonesia lies between the Ring of Fire along the northeastern islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor. The famous and very active San Andreas Fault zone of California is a <b>transform</b> <b>fault</b> which offsets a portion of the East Pacific Rise under southwestern United States and Mexico. The motion of the fault generates numerous small earthquakes, at multiple times a day, most of which are too small to be felt. The active Queen Charlotte Fault on the west coast of the Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, has generated three large earthquakes during the 20th century: a magnitude 7 event in 1929; a magnitude 8.1 in 1949 (Canada's largest recorded earthquake); and a magnitude 7.4 in 1970.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} results of a series of 3 -D {{boundary}} element calcu-lations to investigate the effects of oceanic <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> on stress state and fault development at adjacent mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. We find that the time-averaged strength of <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> is low, and that on time scales longer than a typical earthquake cycle <b>transform</b> <b>faults</b> behave as zones of significant weakness. Specifically, mechanical coupling of only # 5 % best explains the ob-served patterns of strike-slip and oblique normal faulting near a ridge-transform intersection. On time scales shorter than a typical earthquake cycle, transient “locked” periods can produce anomalous reverse faulting similar to that observed at the inside corner (IC) of several slow-spreading ridge segments. Furthermore, we predict that extensional stresses will be suppressed at the IC due to the shear along the transform resisting ridge-normal extension. This implies that an al-ternative mechanism is necessary to explain the preferential normal fault growth and enhanced microseismicity observed at many ICs. 2) 	)) fffi,ffifl) !,$"ff...|$|R
