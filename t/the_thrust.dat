5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> vector and the reaction control system. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

50|$|Focusing on the {{southern}} portion of <b>the</b> Sevier <b>thrust</b> belt many thrust faults can be found. One thrust system is known as <b>the</b> Garden Valley <b>thrust</b> system in <b>the</b> central Nevada <b>thrust</b> belt.

This thrust may have been responsible for the largest slip of the major belt along that latitude. These thrusts were located all along the same strike.

5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E

Development of the duplex beneath <b>the</b> Willard <b>thrust</b> may be explained with a 2 ̆ 2 piggyback 2 ̆ 2 thrust model where younger thrust slices form below and fold an older, overlying thrust sheet. Progressive failure of the footwall ramp of <b>the</b> Willard <b>thrust</b> sheet extended <b>the</b> sole <b>thrust</b> eastward and produced a duplex consisting of thrust slices (horses) which adhered to <b>the</b> overriding <b>thrust</b> sheet where it ramped from a lower sole thrust to an upper decollement horizon. The resulting structural culmination produced a distinct antiform in <b>the</b> Willard <b>thrust</b> sheet. <b>The</b> duplex is here named the Ogden duplex. Frontal folds (formed at ramps perpendicular to transport) and lateral folds (formed at ramps parallel to transport) mark the margin of Individual horses within <b>the</b> duplex. Folded <b>thrusts,</b> thrust-splay relationships, and lateral overlap of horses help determine <b>the</b> sequence of <b>thrusting.</b> <b>The</b> involvement of cratonic foreland basement rocks (Farmington Canyon Complex) in <b>thrust</b> slices within <b>the</b> Ogden duplex is similar to <b>the</b> Moine <b>thrust</b> belt in northern Scotland and pinpoints this area within zone III of Boyer and Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) model of a thrust system dominated by a major <b>thrust</b> sheet. <b>The</b> basement rocks form the core of several horses which moved a minimum of 9. 6 km.
