500|$|The {{predecessor}} to Burger King, Insta-Burger King, began deploying {{the original}} broiling device in 1952 when its owners, Matthew Burns and Kieth Kramer, acquired {{the rights to}} George Read's Inst-Shake and Insta-Broiler machines. The Insta-Broiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers, allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously. The machine was capable of cooking over 400 patties per hour, which allowed the company to grow rapidly. When McLamore and Edgarton opened their first Insta-Burger King location in Miami, they revamped the unit into {{what they called a}} [...] "flame broiler" [...] – the forerunner of the modern unit used by Burger King today. After the acquisition of Insta-Burger King in 1954, the pair contracted the construction of the newly designed flame broilers to the SaniServ company of Indianapolis, Indiana, for the initial run of broilers. Eventually, the company moved the manufacturing contract for <b>the</b> <b>broiler</b> units to Nieco Automatic Broilers of Windsor, California, who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the 2000s.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{the current}} {{business}} structure utilized almost universally in <b>the</b> <b>broiler,</b> or chicken bred for meat, industry. [...] This also began in the 1940s when antibiotics began to be utilized in livestock feed. [...] Perdue is credited as the pioneer of this structure. [...] The basis is centralization of production. [...] ‘Integrators’ control cost, policy, and are the decision makers of production. [...] They decide feed formulations, choice of antibiotic administration, and cover those costs in addition to veterinary services. They also own the poultry that is grown. Farmers are labeled as ‘Growers’ or ‘Operators’. [...] They own the land and buildings where the poultry is grown, and are essentially caretakers for the poultry growth to the Integrators. [...] The benefit for Growers in this business structure is they are guaranteed payment from the Integrators, which is compensated in weight gained by each flock. [...] Due to this structure, about 90% of broilers are raised within 60 miles of the processing plant. [...] Integrators are large poultry companies such as Perdue, Tyson, Pilgrim’s Pride, Koch Foods, etc. [...] There are about 20 of these companies in the U.S. that control 96% of all broilers produced in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Breeding broiler chicks {{for meat}} {{production}} comprises three unique production stages. This complicated production sequence is {{dictated by the}} fact that <b>the</b> modern <b>broiler</b> chick is a cross between four genetically different poultry lines.
