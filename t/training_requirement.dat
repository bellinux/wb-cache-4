500|$|Though {{soldiers}} {{were supposed to}} be allocated to requesting units from replacement depots based on their qualifications and the priority of the unit, McNair found that in practice many commanders in the combat theaters used replacement soldiers to form new units, or personally selected individual replacements from personnel centers without regard to their qualifications. Assigning soldiers to units for which they were not qualified, such as armor crewmen to infantry units, negated the training they had received before going overseas. [...] To address these concerns, McNair advocated faster qualification of replacement soldiers by reducing their training from 24 weeks to 13. [...] The War Department reduced the <b>training</b> <b>requirement</b> to 17 weeks, but mandated continued use of the individual replacement system.|$|E
2500|$|The station {{had never}} been officially {{transferred}} from the RAF and the anti-aircraft support units were quick to return. [...] Several Squadrons were based at Westonzoyland, but the longest stay was by No. 16 Squadron RAF who flew Westland Lysanders, and later with the North American Mustang. Later Supermarine Spitfires became a common sight being flown by No. 19 Squadron RAF and others. Nos. 286 and 587 Squadrons with their mixture of Miles Martinets, Hawker Hurricanes, Airspeed Oxfords, Vultee A-31 Vengeances and North American Harvards remained in residence until {{near the end of}} hostilities. 587 Squadron was formed at RAF Westonzoyland, on 1 December 1943, from 1600 Flight, 1601 Flight and 1625 Flight for anti-aircraft co-operation duties over Wales and the south east of England. It operated a variety of aircraft in this role. Due to the ongoing <b>training</b> <b>requirement</b> the squadron was not disbanded {{at the end of the}} war and it moved to RAF Tangmere on 1 June 1946 to cover the south coast, but was disbanded shortly afterwards on 15 June 1946.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research is to analyze the impact of increased annual <b>training</b> <b>requirements</b> on the reserve component, specifically, the 4 th Assault Amphibian Battalion. Time is a persistent constraint that the reserve force contends with to accomplish annual general military <b>training</b> <b>requirements</b> and mission essential tasks. Currently, there are 18 annual general military <b>training</b> <b>requirements</b> the reserve component must accomplish. Previous studies have attempted to reduce and combine annual <b>training</b> <b>requirements</b> to give time back to the commander. This research will not identify ways to reduce requirements; rather, it will identify ways that the reserve component can more efficiently and effectively accomplish annual <b>training</b> <b>requirements</b> based on feedback from Marines assigned to 4 th Assault Amphibian Battalion. The study analyzes methods 4 th Assault Amphibian Battalion uses to accomplish annual <b>training</b> <b>requirements.</b> Command chronology analysis and interviews provide exploratory insight to the unit's annual training model. Using command chronology data and interview transcripts, we develop a training model {{that can be used to}} improve training effectiveness and efficiency. We believe that adjusting how reserve units conduct 11 of the 18 annual general military training tasks will provide commanders additional time to focus on mission-essential task training.
