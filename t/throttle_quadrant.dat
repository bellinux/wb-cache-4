50|$|Some cockpit {{components}} of the aircraft survive, the rudder pedals, {{the base of the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> and other parts. They are part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum.|$|E
50|$|Some earlier Cherokees used control knobs for the throttle, mixture, and {{propeller}} advance (where applicable), {{while later}} Cherokees use {{a collection of}} two or three control levers in a <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> {{is a set}} of one or more levers {{that are}} most often used to {{simulate}} throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.|$|E
5000|$|A yoke is {{very similar}} to a {{steering}} wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Yokes, like <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrants</b> and pedals, are popular with serious flight-simulation enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing {{this market}} {{a number of}} {{suppliers}} provide ready to go desktop simulation products. Radio stacks, instruments, yokes, pedals, <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrants,</b> and seats are readily available from pilot shops. This allows a highly realistic GA cockpit to be put together {{in a matter of}} minutes. However an enthusiast is likely to extend well beyond the functional cockpit a trainee would require, adding in items to enhance the suspension of disbelief. Enclosures, projectors, even real aircraft components or nose sections are commonly incorporated in the drive to make the experience as 'real' as possible.|$|R
50|$|Triumph Controls - USA with {{locations}} in North Wales, Pennsylvania and Shelbyville, Indiana manufactures and designs mechanical and electromechanical control systems for rotary and fixed wing military and commercial aircraft, military vehicles, naval vessels, industrial plants {{and nuclear power}} stations. Founded in 1943 as Teleflex Aerospace/Defense/Naval Technologies/Power Systems, Triumph Controls - USA develops helicopter collectives, <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrants,</b> flap and spoiler cockpit lever controls, helix cable controls, gearboxes, landing gear, actuation devices, flap, spoiler, landing gear and nose wheel steering control modules, push/pull controls (both sliding cable and ball bearing), detector drive systems and remote mechanical valve actuators. Specific applications include cockpit controls, engine control, vent actuation, water system controls and thrust reversers.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{airliner}} pits offer {{a greater}} challenge to builders {{as there are}} more systems to model such as the auto pilot, CDU/FMS, engine management, etc. Even the <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> is a complex piece of engineering compared to the simply replicated push / pull throttle used in the GA Cessna. However a number of commercial suppliers exist supplying replica panels, controls, even complete cockpits to the community. Where these or 'real' components are not available or are out of budget builders will often fabricate components at home out of wood or similar easily worked materials.|$|E
5000|$|Poorly {{designed}} {{human-machine interfaces}} {{can lead to}} many unexpected problems. A classic {{example of this is}} the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster. [...] Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instrument or <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained the [...] "standard" [...] layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results.|$|E
50|$|American General {{actually}} {{carried out}} a redesign of the Tiger, introducing many improvements over the older AA-5B, including a new split nose bowl that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel, improved exterior lighting, a new fuel indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the previous 12 volt system, a new style <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. These were enough changes that the FAA required an amended type certificate. This added to {{the time required to}} get the aircraft into production and the cost of doing so. The redesigned aircraft was known as the American General AG-5B Tiger.|$|E
50|$|Triumph Controls - Germany GmbH (formerly Teleflex / Kongsberg Automotive) {{based in}} Heiligenhaus, Germany, designs, {{develops}} and manufactures electromechanical and mechanical control systems for rotary and fixed wing military and commercial aircraft applications. With over 60 years of experience, Triumph Controls - Germany continues to supply gearboxes, advanced ball bearing controls and cable control systems including push/pull cable control systems, helix cable controls, wire rope assemblies and helical cable assemblies to large aerospace manufacturers {{as a primary}} or secondary means of controlling a range of flight, ground, cabin comfort and engine management features in their aircraft for applications requiring transfer of linear and/or rotary motion on the aircraft. Such applications include engine control, vent, thrust reversers and water system controls. In addition, Triumph Controls - Germany GmbH produces <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrants</b> for fixed wing and rotorcraft and actuation devices.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Piper {{added the}} Cherokee 180 (PA-28-180) {{powered by a}} 180-horsepower (134-kW) Lycoming O-360 engine. The extra power made it {{practical}} to fly with all four seats filled (depending on passenger weight and fuel loading), and the model remains popular on the used-airplane market. In 1968, the cockpit was modified to replace the [...] "push-pull" [...] style engine <b>throttle</b> controls with <b>quadrant</b> levers. In addition, a third window was added to each side, giving the fuselage the more modern look seen in current production.|$|R
50|$|A {{joystick}} is {{a peripheral}} {{that consists of}} a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for flight simulators. HOTAS controllers, composed of a joystick and <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks {{are designed to be}} operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. Arcade controllers are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{versions}} of the PA30 were produced: the original, a B model, and a C model. The B and C models can carry six passengers and can be identified by the additional side windows. Factory turbocharged engines became available with the B model. Turbo models can be identified {{by the presence of}} vents on the nacelle sides. These use Rajay turbochargers with manual wastegates operated by twin knobs under the <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant.</b> They are properly termed [...] "turbonormalized" [...] since the compression ratio and maximum manifold pressure remained unchanged. Pilots are required to use care to avoid overboosting at low altitudes, since no overboost popoff valves are used. Since there is no accompanying power increase, the B/C models simply give owners a fuel vs. passenger tradeoff. The two rearmost seats, occupying the baggage compartment, are quite small.|$|E
50|$|For {{eleven years}} the design was not {{produced}} {{and then in}} the late 1980s a new company was formed to produce the Tiger. American General Aviation Corporation carried out further design improvements including introducing a new split nose cowling (engine cover) that could be removed without removing the propeller, a new instrument panel and improved exterior lighting, a new fuel quantity indication system, a 28 volt electrical system replacing the older 14 volt system, a new-style <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> and improvements to the heat and ventilation systems. Aerodynamic improvements raised the optimal altitude cruise speed from 139 kn true airspeed to 143 kn TAS. The redesigned aircraft was put into production under an amended type certificate as the American General AG-5B Tiger. The new company had considered producing AA-1s and AA-5A Cheetahs, but those plans were never fulfilled before it closed its doors in 1993. American General produced Tigers for model years 1990-93 and delivered 181 aircraft in that time.|$|E
50|$|Greenamyer {{built the}} Starfighter by {{collecting}} and putting together myriad parts over a 13-year period. The cockpit side panels and some control column bearings of the Red Baron {{came from the}} very first production F-104A, which crashed in Palmdale, California 22 years earlier. The tail of the Red Baron, minus stabilizers, came from a junkyard in Ontario, California. The stabilizers and some nose wheel parts were from scrap piles in Tucson and Homestead, Florida. The idler arm for the elevator controls, the ejection seat rails and some electrical relays came from an F-104 that crashed and burned at Edwards Air Force Base {{on the edge of the}} Mojave Desert. Greenamyer got his <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> from a Tennessee flying buff he met at the Reno Air Races. The trunnion mounts for the nose gear, some of the cooling-system valves and a few relays on the Red Baron came from a 25-ton pile of junk that Greenamyer bought at Eglin Air Force Base. In a swap with NASA, he obtained the nose of a Lockheed NF-104A, with its reaction controls. The all-important J79-GE-10 engine was obtained from the US Navy.|$|E
5000|$|On October 24, 1977, Greenamyer, {{flying a}} {{modified}} F-104 Starfighter [...] "Red Baron" [...] (N104RB), set a FAI Class C-1 Group III 3 km speed record of 988.26 mph, which still stands. An earlier attempt on October 2, 1976 yielded a higher time (1010 mph), but one timing camera didn't work on one run, meaning the record couldn't be certified. He built the Starfighter by collecting and {{putting together a}} myriad of parts over a 13-year period.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} undertaken to evaluate flight operations using cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) {{in a conventional}} jet transport aircraft. Eight two-person airline flight crews participated as test subjects flying simulated terminal area approach and departure operations under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). A fixed-base cockpit simulator configured with {{a full complement of}} conventional electromechanical instrumentation to permit full workload operations was utilized. Traffic information was displayed on a color cathode-ray tube (CRT) mounted above the <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> in the typical weather radar location. A transparent touchpanel overlay was utilized for pilot interface with the display. Air traffic control (ATC) simulation included an experienced controller and full partyline radio environment for evaluation of pilot-controlled self-separation and traffic situation monitoring tasks. Results of the study revealed the CDTI to be well received by the test subjects as a useful system which could be incorporated into an existing jet transport cockpit. Crew coordination and consistent operating procedures were identified as important considerations in operational implementation of traffic displays. Cockpit workload was increased with active CDTI tasks. However, all test subjects rated the increase to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|The {{rendezvous}} of a pilot-controlled space ferry {{vehicle with}} an orbiting space station was simulated in {{six degrees of}} freedom. A fixed-base simulator and an analog computer were used. The ferry vehicle was assumed to have a single main thrusting rocket and to be provided with attitude control. Control of the thrust was provided by a rocket <b>throttle</b> <b>quadrant</b> which could provide either proportional or on-off control. The attitude of the vehicle was controlled during the rendezvous with a two-axis, pencil-type side-arm controller and rudder pedals. For the most part rendezvous maneuvers were made with the target satellite in a circular orbit. In addition, an elliptical station orbit was investigated. Tolerable initial conditions, as well as adequate data presentations, were determined. Results of the investigation indicate that a human pilot can rendezvous successfully with the vehicle and instrumentation considered over a wide band of initial conditions. Coplanar conditions are not necessary. Retro-rocket fuel used is not greatly increased by imposing perturbing influences such as rocket-misalignment torques on the rendezvous vehicle. When excessive attitude-control torques are required to maintain the necessary trim attitudes under misalignment influences, the reaction fuel used for this control increases. The time required for a specific rendezvous varies somewhat between pilots. If control of the time for completing the rendezvous is desired, requirements for retrorocket fuel are affected, and an energy-management schedule is required. Continuous variation of the thrust is not necessary. The pilot positions the throttle to obtain a desired level of thrust, and applies bursts of thrust as required. All data were presented on dialed instruments. The quantities required are range and range rate and line-of-sight rates between the vehicle and the station, vehicle attitudes and angular rates, and the angles subtended by the line of sight. For the equipment assumed herein, satellite rendezvous presented no great problem to the pilot...|$|E
