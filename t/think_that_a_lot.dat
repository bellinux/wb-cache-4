500|$|Sonic Rs soundtrack was {{particularly}} divisive. Nutter described the [...] "storm of controversy [...] surrounds the accompanying music", which [...] "has {{come in for}} a bit of a slagging on the Internet recently for the addition of vocals." [...] Although he was [...] "not a particular fan of dance music", Nutter stated that the tracks were [...] "better than most chart stuff", while the included instrumental versions were sufficient [...] "to appease everyone". Sackenheim offered high praise for [...] "One of the most inspired soundtracks I've ever heard", while MacDonald commented: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more games should have songs with vocals. It gives the game so much more personality". Conversely, Dan Elektro deplored the [...] "unbelievably annoying music". Computer and Video Games complimented the music, saying it [...] "fits the Sonic style perfectly", and is reminiscent of Sonic CDs soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of the problems we}} deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E

5000|$|Somewhere {{along the}} line I wrote <b>a</b> song <b>that</b> had birds in it. And then by pure coincidence, another. Some critic asked, [...] "Why all these songs about birds?" [...] And I said to myself, [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of songs about birds?!? I'll show you <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of songs about birds!" [...] So, for a while, I stuck birds in {{everywhere}} I could.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Clayton, {{lead singer}} of ANTiSEEN, has {{described}} this album as a mixed blessing. Although he is {{very happy with the}} way it turned out, he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people got the impression that they are nothing more than a backing band for Allin. Clayton has stated that Allin was very professional during the recording of the album, and he wonders how much of Allin's stage act was real and how much of it was [...] "for the marks." ...|$|R
5000|$|Director Jonathan Demme has commented, [...] "Beloved only {{played in}} theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million dollars -- I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money. And {{the only reason}} it left theaters after a month was because the Disney {{corporation}} that released the picture wanted all the Beloved theaters -- where we were doing very well, {{in a number of}} situations. The Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for Adam Sandlers Waterboy. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back {{at the end of the}} year, and they didnt. But the picture did very respectfully. It was in the top ten its whole life." ...|$|R

2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that is passed on from parent to child. I think George wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping {{into and out of}} stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2014, the Las Vegas Sun {{featured}} {{an article}} about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by AVN magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the Sun article, Andrea Domanick, [...] "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, [...] "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of companies are doing what we’re doing. They’re setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don’t want a target on their back." [...] Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, [...] "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use." [...] The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, [...] "A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It’s a very good training ground." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} Cyrus' songs, Chelsom said, [...] "We {{realized}} this {{was an opportunity to}} move forward with the music, to update it and make it more sophisticated, to move with Miley’s age. I’ve never had a better musical experience on any film." [...] Cyrus noted that most of the songs included on the soundtrack were inspired by the return of Cyrus' character, Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana, to her [...] Nashville roots. She explained, [...] "The soundtrack is all about Nashville, and that's where I'm from, that's my roots. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the reason I am who I am." [...] Cyrus co-wrote [...] "Don't Walk Away" [...] because it was to be included on her own studio album Breakout (2008). [...] "Hoedown Throwdown", a song in which Cyrus calls dance steps, took much time to write. It became an ongoing collaboration between Chelsom, Cyrus, choreographer Jamal Sims, and the song's writers, Adam Anders and Nikki Hasman.|$|R
50|$|Lyrically, The Fool explores {{topics of}} romantic relationships, family relationships, self-discovery and self-doubt. On the {{overlying}} {{theme of the}} album, Weaver stated the following:The record poses the question: Is it foolish to settle for what you always thought you wanted as a 22-year-old woman, or is it foolish to go and leave what’s so beautiful, stable, and certain? I <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>a</b> question <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of young women have these days, especially coming from a generation of girls who — in my opinion— have less of a road map. It’s not just about being a woman: It’s about being a modern human and about fear of commitment.|$|R

5000|$|In 2015, it was {{announced}} that the main festival would relocate to Montpellier, France as crowds had shrunk to between 20,000-24,000. Former I Love Techno organiser Peter Decuypere partly blamed the shrinking crowds on the festival embracing genres like dubstep and electro house. [...] "The map was redrawn by dubstep and electro," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> caused <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of damage to the I Love Techno brand.".|$|R

5000|$|Idea, {{released}} in September 1968, was the Bee Gees' third international album. [...] "We were in friction at that point," [...] says Barry. [...] "We weren't getting on, {{and that was}} it. I {{think it was a}} mixture of the group not getting along very well and egos. Ego, I think, is the key word for this group. It's not unlike any other group in that everybody wants to be the one that gets the attention. Unfortunately, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> happens <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> Certainly it happened to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} the group's debut led to a {{recording}} contract with Island Records, an English label which had an American distribution deal with Cotillion Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic, itself owned by Ahmet Ertegun. Emerson believed that Ertegun agreed to take the band on [...] "because we could sell out 20,000-seaters before we even had a record out.

[...] Richmond left the party in 1968 after his paper criticized the Soviet Union for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, though he remained a Marxist. His autobiography, [...] "A Long View From The Left," [...] was published in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Samantha Bee of The Daily Show interviewed Nuckols. In the interview, he said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the {{pleasure}} of eating the Hufu product, is imagining you're eating human flesh. For that moment, {{you can join the}} fraternity of cannibals... If you really want to come {{as close as possible to}} the experience of cannibalism, Hufu is your best option." [...] Nuckols was also interviewed by a variety of radio and print media, including The Harvard Crimson and The Stanford Daily. Stuff You Should Know, a podcast from HowStuffWorks.com, touched on Hufu during the introduction of the [...] "How the Donner Party Worked" [...] episode in March, 2012.|$|E

5000|$|About the season's criticism, Joss Whedon says: [...] "I love season 6. It’s really important. But {{it was a}} very stark {{thing to}} do. It wasn’t just putting Buffy in a very bad, abusive, weird relationship, it was some sort of an end to magic. For me because {{childhood}} is so rich with metaphor, a lot of {{it had to do with}} leaving that behind. Instead of a bigger than life villain, we had the nerd troika. Instead of drinking blood and doing spells as sexual metaphor, we had sex. Things became very literal and they lost some of their loveliness. I still <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the best episodes we ever did were in season 6. I don’t agree with the detractors, but I understand it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Neighbor {{was called}} [...] "deliciously dark and humorous" [...] by Dread Central's Steve Barton, who awarded it a 4/5, while Audrey Quaranta of Fangoria gave the film a 3½ out of 4, and {{categorized}} it as [...] "definitely {{one for the}} gore-lover's library". In a review for Horror News, Todd Martin wrote, [...] "Do yourself a huge favor. Run {{out and get a}} copy of Neighbor as soon as it is available to own. Trust me, you won’t regret it. If I had to describe it in just a few words I would say it was brutal, disturbing, and at times, a little hard to watch (and this is coming from a hardcore gore fiend). I was very impressed by this film and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other viewers will be as well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Social and {{political}} issues, namely injustice, constitute {{much of the}} lyrical content on The Sufferer & the Witness.

2500|$|Reading {{finished}} their first {{season in the}} English top flight in eighth place, just one point short of UEFA Cup qualification. In recognition of this performance, Coppell won the Manager of the Year award for the second season in succession. Speaking earlier in the season, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said of Coppell: [...] "I think it's totally deserved. It's a marvellous contribution he's made.

5000|$|In a 1977 interview, Paul made {{plain that}} he opposed the choice from the beginning: [...] "I <b>think</b> though <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{mistakes}} were made at the time. The biggest one was releasing 'Am I Black Enough For You' straight after 'Mrs. Jones'. People weren't ready for <b>that</b> kind of <b>a</b> song after the pop success of 'Mrs. Jones'. They {{were looking for a}} sequel or at least something that wasn't provocative. You'll remember at the time that I told you I was 100% against it and history has proven me right. But though it was a company mistake, I'm still satisfied with both CBS and Philadelphia International." ...|$|R
