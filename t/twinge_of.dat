500|$|Reviewers responded {{positively}} to the cast. Kendall described the acting as [...] "top notch" [...] and Owen {{said that all}} cast-members [...] "played their roles to perfection", while Jane Simon, writing for The Daily Mirror, said that [...] "every <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> awkwardness and discomfort is played to perfection as the mood turns darker". Harry Venning, writing for The Stage, described the cast as [...] "impressively stellar", and also commended the writers' performances. Comedy critic Bruce Dessau said that the [...] "cast alone is almost recommendation enough", while another reviewer said that if [...] "a bomb dropped on the cupboard where they were hiding, {{a good portion of}} the acting talent in this country would be wiped out." [...] Key's portrayal of Ian and Parkinson's portrayal of Rebecca were particularly praised.|$|E
500|$|Sepinwall {{noted that}} he could see [...] "the obvious {{parallels}} to Michael's personal situation" [...] in this installment, while The A.V. Club editor Zack Handlen said that Awake [...] "continues to connect routine procedural storylines and find new ways to give them deeper meaning". Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about [...] "bringing two people who have drifted apart back together" [...] and that [...] "Nightswimming" [...] has [...] "balanced the series' larger mystery with grief and a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> optimism" [...] on a [...] "smaller scale" [...] compared to other entries of the program. He claimed that the installment was designed to [...] "introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special", adding that [...] "For most of the series, there hasn't been much chemistry between the two".|$|E
500|$|Through the {{character}} of Hud, Ritt and Newman had intended to show the corruption of modern capitalism and the pitfalls of admiring an individual blindly, without observing his character. Critics, however, did not universally echo this view. Lifes review described Hud as [...] "likable, smart, and [...] the potential to measure up to his tough, honorable father" [...] and Saturday Review called him a [...] "charming, raffish monster". According to Outlook, [...] "Hud Bannon is a mean, unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> conscience or change of heart"; in the end scene, Hud [...] "ulls down the shade on the world of goodness and decency". Pauline Kael initially described the film as an [...] "anti-Western"; she called it an [...] "anti-American film", which was [...] "so astutely made and yet such a mess that it (was) redeemed by its fundamental dishonesty." ...|$|E

500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Gasper {{commented on}} the resignation of Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla after {{it was revealed that}} he had financially supported a group campaigning to prevent the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in California. Gasper claimed Eich had been [...] "victimised by a queer mafia that takes a vindictive pleasure in bullying and abusing people" [...] and that this [...] "Homo fascism is a threat to fundamental human rights." [...] Among those she accused of contributing to this campaign were US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the Labour Party, the United Nations, the European Union, Amnesty International, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the Bishop of Buckingham Alan Wilson, Pope Francis, the actor Daniel Radcliffe, all European and American universities, and media such as The Guardian, The Daily Mail, and The Huffington Post. The following day, she condemned World AIDS Day as a celebration of HIV/AIDS and homosexuality, claiming it [...] "congratulates" [...] people for [...] "spreading the disease". Some days later she claimed that in campaigning for legal recognition of same-sex marriage, [...] "queer thugs and gangsters" [...] had [...] "used violence, threats, censorship, abuse, and every form of dirty tactic". She hoped that [...] "a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> guilt... kills them".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp {{said the}} music video {{faithfully}} mirrored the song's lyrics and was understated by Del Rey's usual standards. Darwin who opined that the clip recalled Del Rey's short film Tropico (2013), deemed it [...] "a total cinematic gem," [...] and [...] "a gorgeous mashup of retro glamour and modern independence". The visual was also lauded by Complex writer Lauren Nostro who {{called it a}} [...] "stunning, cinematic" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] video, and Anna Moslein of Glamour who deemed it [...] "summer-perfect". Zumic's Bradley Bershad described the clip as [...] "a slightly bizarre, very dramatic trip through time and space" [...] and said its noir influences matched the track well, adding that its [...] "old school meets new school" [...] feel continued the musical persona Del Rey had crafted for herself. Bershad's view was shared by Smith who wrote, [...] "It pretty well marries together her continuing play with female sexuality, Hollywood stereotypes and insistence that she is her own creation". While DeGroot commended the video's black-and-white photography and flame imagery which he opined were less pretentious than that of [...] "Jeremy", which [...] "West Coast" [...] was compared to. Matthew Bramlett of TheWrap opined that Del Rey [...] "perfectly encapsulates her 'vintage California rich kid' look" [...] in the video and described the clip as [...] "very chic, with just a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> the old Hollywood flair" [...] the singer had embraced in her previous visuals. In a mixed review, Patrick D. McDermott of The Fader called the visual [...] "classic, kind of sad [...] in romantic black and white", but felt it was confusing and [...] "on-brand...a meticulous homage to nothing in particular". While Nelson wrote that the clip failed to enhance the song, but was understated enough not to detract from the music.|$|E

Lockhart is childishly {{proud of being}} able to write in [...] "joined-up letters". He still enjoys signing autographs and still {{receives}} fan mail, although he has no idea why. For his part, Harry feels a slight <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> guilt for Lockhart's amnesia, but he consoles himself with {{the fact that it was}} Lockhart's own fault. Lockhart never fully recovers, despite all efforts to cure him, and remains in St. Mungo's with amnesia. Harry and Ron never reveal that Lockhart was a fraud.|$|E
2500|$|On February 12, 2012, Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "We Found Love" [...] at the 54th Grammy Awards {{held at the}} Staples Center in Los Angeles, {{followed by}} her duet single [...] "Princess of China" [...] with Coldplay for first time. John Mitchell from MTV News said he thought Rihanna looked [...] "gorgeous" [...] and that she gave [...] "off a Tina Turner vibe — Rihanna rocked the blond locks she introduced recently, wearing a tight, belly-baring ensemble." [...] USA Todays writer Ed Masley, praised the performance, describing it as [...] "shout in shout-out". The Huffington Post {{also noted that the}} performance had [...] "a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> Tina Turner". Time magazine graded the performance with an A, saying that [...] "Rihanna never disappoints. Her pop songs are always danceable, often catchy and consistently awesome — sometimes they even have some substance to them. Similarly, her Grammy performance wasn’t the flashiest or craziest, and she didn’t bust out dance moves the way other entertainers did, but {{it was one of the}} most enjoyable." ...|$|E
60|$|As for the Englishman! Well! {{no doubt}} he had {{disappeared}} long ago out of Crystal de Cambray's life. De Marmont had never feared him greatly.

2500|$|Like Schaffner, Beatles author Robert Rodriguez notes A's folly in {{missing out}} on Harrison's [...] "strongest {{collection}} in years and possibly most commercial ever". Rodriguez describes [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] as [...] "perhaps Harrison's finest pure love song since 'Something'" [...] and ranks his acoustic-guitar solo among [...] "this ex-Fab's Top 5 all-time instrumental interludes". Simon Leng views the composition as one of Harrison's best love songs from the whole of his career and admires the recording as [...] "usically, lyrically, and vocally polished" [...] with a [...] "beautifully flowing" [...] mid-song solo. Leng suggests that Harrison's former bandmate Paul McCartney [...] "might have experienced a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> envy" [...] when listening to the song. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense has since praised the guitar solo, along with those on tracks such as [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World" [...] and the Beatles' [...] "Fixing a Hole", as examples of how Harrison's playing displays [...] "structure, syntax, and development" [...] over [...] "pyrotechnic flourishes". Rense adds: [...] "These [...] are thoughtful and original, deceptively simple sounding, invested with feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E

Here he is an angel of sexual health in an impossibly euphoric world where sibling rivalry and sexual jealousy are only passing <b>twinges</b> <b>of</b> discomfort, not {{consuming}} passions. The movie's blissful spirits coincide with its portrait of modern, freshly-scrubbed-looking Dublin as the closest thing to Fun City the British isles have to offer nowadays." ...|$|R
