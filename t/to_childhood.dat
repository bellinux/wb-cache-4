5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.|$|E

25|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} common among {{children}} from, low-income, African American and Hispanic communities. This is mainly because minority children {{spend less time}} playing outside the house and staying active. Some contributors <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> obesity is that parents would rather have their children stay inside the home because they fear that gang, drug violence, and other dangers might harm them.|$|E
25|$|A British {{longitudinal}} study {{has found that}} obesity restricted <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> has minimal influence on adult outcomes at age 30. The study also found that, while obesity that continues into adulthood has little influence on men's outcomes, it makes women {{less likely to have}} ever been employed or to currently have a romantic partner.|$|E

25|$|Early {{theories}} of the cause of anorexia linked it <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> sexual abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting, and well-designed research is needed.

25|$|The {{intensity}} and reactivity of a person's negative affectivity, or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms {{more strongly than}} does childhood sexual abuse. This finding, differences in brain structure (see Brain abnormalities), {{and the fact that}} some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history, suggest that BPD is distinct from the post-traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it. Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> trauma.|$|E

25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse multifocal cortical hyperexcitability, which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation {{for this is that}} children are susceptible to autonomic disorders as illustrated by the cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific <b>to</b> <b>childhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{behavior}} undergoes {{substantial changes}} during adolescence. Some {{of these changes}} may be societal in humans, but other changes are hormonal. Another important change is the {{decrease in the number}} of hours of sleep, as compared <b>to</b> <b>childhood,</b> which gradually becomes identical to an adult. It is also being speculated that homeostatic regulation mechanisms may be altered during adolescence. Apart from this, the effect of changing routines of adolescents on other behavior such as cognition and attention is yet to be studied.|$|E

25|$|In 73 {{individual}} cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> favorites, and also included popular {{songs from the}} radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicated why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM is related <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> anatomy and immune function. Either {{bacteria}} or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who}} have Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of the tympanic membrane from a puff of air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|Ridge & Feeney (1998) {{have studied}} {{a group of}} gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the {{frequency}} of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related <b>to</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participant's relationship with their fathers.|$|E
