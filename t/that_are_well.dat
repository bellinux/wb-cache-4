5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small- to {{medium-sized}} birds that includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. In Tasmania, eight species have been recorded, one endemic and another a vagrant.|$|E

5|$|Chris pays a visit {{during his}} nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him {{so they can}} clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while {{discussing}} the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> received by Chris.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} seven races in the game, but only TetraCorp (representing the human race) is playable. Upon {{discovering}} an alien race, diplomacy can be initiated in order to arrange actions such as non-aggression pacts and joint-combat treaties, as well as accuse them of spying or trading with the Mauna (Trading with the Mauna is illegal under Federation law). If a faction {{is found to be}} trading with the Mauna, Jane Fong (Federal minister for trade relations in addition to her role as Terran ambassador for the Fragmented Sectors) can be informed, who will in turn tell the Federation, which could result in increased hostility towards the offending faction from all others or, they can be threatened with blackmail and forced to pay a tribute in return for the players silence. Each race has a unique look and diplomatic strategies and everything happens in real time with highly detailed characters <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> animated and lip-synced. One of the factions — The Mauna, are not members of the Federation and are unable to be negotiated or traded with.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} dozens of sites with {{substantial}} temple remains, although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or Middle Egypt are well preserved. Those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the Egyptian tourist industry, which is a major sector of the Egyptian economy. Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to protect ancient monuments from the harmful effects of tourist activity. Archaeological work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> {{adapted for}} {{exploiting}} disturbance sites {{are referred to}} as pioneers or early successional species. These shade-intolerant species are able to photosynthesize at high rates and as a result grow quickly. Their fast growth is usually balanced by short life spans. Furthermore, although these species often dominate immediately following a disturbance, they are unable to compete with shade-tolerant species later on and replaced by these species through succession. However these shifts may not reflect the progressive entry to the community of the taller long-lived forms, but instead, the gradual emergence and dominance of species that may have been present, but inconspicuous directly after the disturbance.|$|E
25|$|David Campos, {{author of}} the book, Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook, {{illuminates}} the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth. It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It is at this point when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. Because of the fact that S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen will exist at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to inseminate females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E

25|$|With oral administration, {{progesterone}} {{is rapidly}} metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. As many as 30 different metabolites {{have been found}} to be formed from progesterone with oral ingestion. Regardless of the route of administration, 5α-reductase is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of progesterone and is responsible for approximately 60 to 65% of its metabolism. 5β-Reductase is also a major enzyme in the metabolism of progesterone. 5α-Reduction of progesterone occurs predominantly in the intestines (specifically the duodenum), whereas 5β-reduction occurs almost exclusively in the liver. The metabolites of progesterone produced by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase (after further transformation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) are allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, respectively. With oral administration of progesterone, they occur in circulation at very high and in fact supraphysiological concentrations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> in excess of those of progesterone itself (peak concentrations of 30ng/mL for allopregnanolone and 60ng/mL for pregnanolone versus 12ng/mL for progesterone at 4hours after a single 200-mg oral dose of progesterone).|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{tianeptine}} {{was found}} to be a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) full agonist using human proteins. It was also found to act as a full agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, although tianeptine produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result in tolerance or withdrawal. The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However anecdotal reports from recreational, non-medical tianeptine users suggest that significant withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged high dose usage. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of tianeptine at high doses <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>well</b> above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E
