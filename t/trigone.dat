25|$|The three openings, two {{ureteric}} orifices, and {{the internal}} urethral orifice mark the triangular area called the <b>trigone</b> of the bladder. These openings have mucosal flaps {{in front of them}} that act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as vesicoureteral reflux. Between the two ureteric openings is a raised area of tissue called the interureteric crest. This makes the upper boundary of the <b>trigone.</b> The <b>trigone</b> is a smooth-muscle area that forms the floor of the bladder above the urethra.

The ventricular enlargement was evaluated by the ventricular:brain ratio, the signal intensity of white matter posterosuperior to <b>trigones</b> by reference to standard images and the white matter lesions by a semiquantitative method. In the congenital dystrophy type 1, MRI was characterized by ventriculomegaly and moderate/severe hyperintensity of white matter posterosuperior to <b>trigones,</b> which showed no correlation with the age. MRI in the adult-form dystrophy type 1 was strictly related to disease duration and varied between normal findings, except for temporo-polar white matter lesions, in age-matched patients and ventriculomegaly with white matter hyperintensities in disease duration-matched patients.

25|$|He had luck in {{the latter}} statement. In most {{amphibian}} organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of noradrenaline, and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott’s hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of sympathetic nerve impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the <b>trigone</b> but not relaxant effects in the fundus of the cat′s urinary bladder. In this respect, ″amino-ethanol-catechol″ – noradrenaline – mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did. The Harvard Medical School physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, who had popularized {{the idea of a}} sympatho-adrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed an elaborate but ″queer″ theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory). The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be the – or at least one – postganglionic sympathetic transmitter. However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was ″a substance like acetylcholine", and adrenergic if it was ″some substance like adrenaline″.|$|E

2500|$|The human {{urinary bladder}} {{derives from the}} {{urogenital}} sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. The upper and lower parts of the bladder develop separately and join together around the middle part of development.

40|$|AbstractBackground: There {{is still}} no {{agreement}} about the optimal method of surgical relief of fixed subaortic stenosis, particularly the severe forms. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe a new technique for the relief of subaortic stenosis based on analysis of the functional anatomy of the left ventricular outflow tract and pathophysiologic features of subaortic stenosis. Methods and patients: We propose that one of the basic abnormalities in subaortic stenosis is interference with the hinge mechanism provided by the 2 fibrous <b>trigones</b> with progressive deposition of fibrous tissue in these angles. The technique described in this paper consists of excision of all components of the fibrous “ring,” with mobilization of the left and right fibrous <b>trigones.</b> This results in the restoration of the normal dynamic behavior of the left ventricular outflow tract with maximal widening of the outflow tract as the result of backward displacement of the subaortic curtain and anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. This technique has been used in 57 consecutive patients who ranged in age between 5 months and 56 years (mean, 15. 5 ± 10. 6 years). Gradients across the left ventricular outflow tract were between 45 and 200 mm Hg (mean, 86. 7 mm Hg). Additional lesions were present in 10 patients, and 7 patients had had 8 previous operations on the left ventricular outflow tract. At operation, in addition to resection of subaortic stenosis, 3 patients had aortic valvotomy, 2 patients had homograft replacement of the aortic valve, 7 patients had patch closure of a ventricular septal defect, and 1 patient had open mitral valvotomy. Results: There were 2 early deaths and 1 late sudden death during the follow-up period that ranged from 1 month to 25 years (mean, 15. 2 years). One patient experienced the development of endocarditis on the aortic valve 7 years after operation, which was successfully treated by homograft replacement. Postoperative gradients across the left ventricular outflow tract varied from no gradient to 30 mm Hg (mean, 8 mm Hg). There were no instances of recurrence of a gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract. Conclusion: It is concluded that mobilization of the left and right fibrous <b>trigones</b> results in durable relief of subaortic stenosis. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 126 - 33...|$|R

40|$|Examination of {{a series}} of fresh normal hearts has {{revealed}} certain features of the anatomy of the mitral valve that are not mentioned in textbooks of anatomy or in clinical articles. Briefly, the fibrous ring to which the cusps of the mitral valve are attached does not lie in one plane as shown in standard textbooks, and conse-quently the relationship of the anterior, aortic, or septal cusp of the valve to the left atrium, and to the inflow and outflow channels of the left ventricle, is not that which would be inferred if the ring were in one plane. The fibrous ring, part of the framework of the heart, which separates atrium from ventricle, and to which the cusps of the mitral valve are attached, consists, in its superomedial part, of the borders of the right and left fibrous <b>trigones,</b> and the fibrous wall of the subaortic part of the left ventri-cular chamber with which they are continuous. The remaining and inferolateral part of the ring is continuous with the <b>trigones</b> (Fig. 3). The ring so formed does not lie in one plane but is hinged about an axis which joins the two commissures of the valve cusps (Figs. 1 and 3). The shape of the anterior cusp can be seen in Fig. 4. Its attached border forms an arc, and its free border is subdivided into three regions: a middle one the centre of which is free from FIG. 1. -The right half of the aorta and left atrium and ventricle divided down the centre of the anterior cusp of the mitral valve which has been propped open to represent its position in diastole.

40|$|Objective: The aortic and mitral valves {{have been}} studied in isolation, as if their {{functions}} were independent. We hypothesized that both valves work in synchrony {{on the basis of}} the shared myocardial pump and orifice. Methods: Six sonometric crystals (7 sheep) were placed in both <b>trigones,</b> the midpoint of the anterior and posterior anulus, and the lateral extremities of the posterior anulus. In a separate series of animals, 3 crystals (8 sheep) were implanted in the aortic annular base of the right, left, and noncoronary sinuses of Valsalva.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: X-linked -thalassemia/mental {{retardation}} syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 301040) {{is one of}} the X-linked {{intellectual disability}} syndromes caused by mutations of the ATRX gene and characterized by male predominance, central hypotonic facies, severe cognitive dysfunction, hemoglobin H disease (-thalassemia), genital and skeletal abnormalities, and autistic and peculiar behavior. More than 200 patients in the world, including 70 Japanese patients, have been diagnosed with ATR-X syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the brain MRI and/or CT findings of 27 Japanese patients with ATR-X with ATRX mutations retrospectively. RESULTS: The findings were categorized into 5 types: 1) nonspecific brain atrophy (17 / 27); 2) white matter abnormalities, especially around the <b>trigones</b> (11 / 27); 3) widespread and scattered white matter abnormalities (1 / 27); 4) delayed myelination (4 / 27); and 5) severe and rapidly progressive cortical brain atrophy (1 / 27). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on a comprehensive study of brainMRI/CT findings of ATR-X syndrome. Our findings suggest that the ATRX protein seems to be involved in normal myelination. The classification will require revisions in the near future, but it will be helpful in establishing the relationship between ATRXmutation and brain development and understanding the ATRX protein function in the brain.

White matter lesions (WMLs) and large Virchow Robin spaces (VRSs) were rated by semiquantitative methods and the signal intensity of white matter superior and posterior to the <b>trigones</b> (WMPST) by reference to standard images. Disease duration was correlated positively with WML and negatively with VRS scores. Patients were divided into four groups according to increasing severity of WMPST involvement: group A with mild WMPST hyperintensity, group B with large VRSs and mild or moderate WMPST hyperintensity, group C with moderate WMPST hyperintensity or mild WMPST hyperintensity with small WMLs, group D with severe WMPST hyperintensity or moderate WMPST hyperintensity with small WMLs. Disease duration, muscular impairment, lobar WMLs and brain atrophy significantly increased from groups A and B (not significantly different) to C and from C to D, while convexity VRSs significantly decreased from group B to C and from C to D. Lobar white matter involvement in DM 1 seems progressive during the disease and may be characterized initially by large VRSs or mild WMPST hyperintensity, then by small WMLs or moderate WMPST hyperintensity, and finally by more extensive and confluent WMLs or diffuse white matter hyperintensity and by brain atrophy...|$|R
