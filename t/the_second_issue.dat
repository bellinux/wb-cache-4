5|$|In early 1946, British fan John Carnell {{launched}} a new science fiction magazine titled New Worlds, published by Pendulum Publications.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue</b> {{is whether}} the name should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) for the same taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue</b> of {{the comic}} Homeworlds was {{revealed}} to focus around Tali's past. Released on May 30, 2012, the issue tells {{of the beginning of}} her Pilgrimage, and the events leading up to her appearance in the first game. Originally intending to take the quarian ship Honorata to the planet Illium, along with Keenah'Breizh, in search of valuable items, they discover geth activity on an unidentified ice planet. Tali extracts the memory core from one of the geth, and discovers a recording of a conversation between Saren and Matriarch Benezia discussing the attack on Eden Prime.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue,</b> ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the Smallville {{series was}} {{continued}} through the comic book medium with Smallville: Season 11. Written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issues features Chloe Sullivan referencing that each team member has established an info hub on their own territory, with communication systems linked to the Watchtower. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue,</b> Lex Luthor discovers that Queen Industries is building a facility {{on the far side}} of Earth's moon as a base for the Justice League, and its construction is under John Jones' supervision. Despite having died after her encounter with Lex Luthor, the League's liaison is Tess Mercer, whose consciousness is revealed to be bonded to her half-brother's mind. Luthor sees this as an opportunity to learn the heroes' secrets before removing Tess from his mind, and creates measures to prevent them from finding out his situations with Tess. Despite his efforts, Tess still manage to send her message to the League of her predicaments with Lex, and they extract her consciousness from him and uploaded it to the Watchtower computer system as a temporary home for her mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the sinking of the}} first colliery {{at the head of the}} Rhondda, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue</b> of transportation was being tackled at the same time with the extension of the Taff Vale Railway (TVR) line. After Royal Assent was given to construct the railway in 1836, the original line was laid from Cardiff to Abercynon, and by 1841 a branch was opened to link Cardiff with Dinas via Pontypridd. This would allow easier and faster transportation for Walter Coffin's Dinas mine, an unsurprising addition considering Coffin was a director of the TVR. In 1849 the TVR had extended into the Rhondda Fach and by 1856 the railway had reached the furthest areas of both the Fach and Fawr valleys at Maerdy and Treherbert. For the first time the Rhondda Valley was connected by a major transportation route to the rest of Wales and the exploitation of its coalfields could begin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue</b> was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>issue</b> {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency {{first issued}} during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E

40|$|Session 4 - Markets and Financial Stability 2 We {{propose that}} when a firm cross-lists in {{segmented}} markets, in pricing <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>issued</b> share, <b>the</b> first issued share price as a reference plays both an informational and anchoring role. We develop a model illustrating the dual-role and relating the anchoring bias to the IPO underpricing of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>issued</b> share. Empirically, we examine a group of Chinese firms that first issued foreign shares and then domestic A-shares, in which the anchoring effect contributes to more A-share underpricing. The anchoring model predicts a positive association between differences in costs of capital and the A-share underpricing, and that this positive association is weaker when participants {{are less likely to}} resort to this anchoring heuristic or/and when the A-share valuation is less uncertain. Empirical results support our dual-role hypothesis. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 24 th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, Australia, 14 - 16 December 2011, p. 1 - 5...|$|R
