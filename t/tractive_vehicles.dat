To avoid breaking of flexible high pressure hose, we proposed to protect with a strong sealed shell filled under pressure with gas (air or inert gas), providing reduction of after-effects of cyclic loads on the hose and, as a result, providing increase of its resource, safety and durability. The structure of flexible high pressure piping due to back pressure {{from the side of}} the strong sealed shell improves hose properties and reduces cyclic loads on the hydraulic actuator, prevents the hose from untimely breaking and ejection of working liquid into the atmosphere. At the same time,operating expenses and contamination of the environment are reduced...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Soil {{compaction}} is {{an acute}} {{problem in the}} southeastern U. S., requiring periodic subsoiling to alleviate densely compacted soils. Controlling vehicle traffic is one method that has been recommended for reducing {{the negative effects of}} vehicle traffic. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the differences in soil bulk density and cone index resulting from the interactions of surface tillage, subsoiling, and controlled traffic in a long-term corn-soybean cropping system experiment in a Coastal Plain soil in the southeastern U. S. Traffic or no-traffic treatments were accomplished using an experimental wide-frame <b>tractive</b> <b>vehicle</b> (WFTV), which enabled operations without traffic on 6. 1 m wide growing zones. Subsoiling treatments included no subsoiling, annual in-row subsoiling, and initial one-time subsoiling on 25 cm centers to completely disrupt the soil to the 40 cm depth. Surface tillage treatments were no-tillage or disking and field cultivation. Soil measurements were taken after the treatments were imposed for five years. Bulk density and cone index measurements were taken at three positions in the plots: the trafficked row middle, the in-row position, and the non-trafficked row middle. Four significant conclusions from this study can be drawn: (1) vehicle traffic increased soil bulk density nearest the surface in all row positions, with the greatest increases occurring directly in the trafficked row position where equipment traffic was applied; (2) no-tillage caused significantly increased bulk density values near the soil surface in all three row positions; (3) annual in-row subsoiling effectively relieved soil compaction, while the initial complete disruption subsoiling treatment had similar bulk density and cone index values as the no-subsoiling treatment; and (4) in-row subsoiling also loosened th...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model of wheeled <b>vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> or braking performance was developed and verified by experimental data. Then, various center of gravity and height of application force movement effects were analysed by simulation analysis. For a given set of vehicle dimensions and terrain wheel system constants, the simulation calculated effective tractive or braking effort and rear wheel sinkage, slip ratio or skid of a special designed wheeled robotic vehicle running over sloped weak sandy terrain for straight forward motion. For a 5. 88 kN weight vehicle, the optimal eccentricity of center of gravity, the optimal application height and the maximum slope angle of terrain could be determined for rear-wheel drive (RWD), front-wheel drive (FWD), four-wheel drive (4 WD) or rear-wheel brake (RWB), front-wheel brake (FWB), and four-wheel brake (4 WB) travel systems. ...|$|R

The first version of the model outputs fuel consumption based on available modal data. However, due to the limited heavy-duty vehicle data, MOVES rates need to be supplemented with rates determined with the Physical Emission Rate Estimator (PERE). PERE combines <b>vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> power together with vehicle powertrain parameters specific to the class of vehicle; the vehicle weight, shape, engine type, and transmission. Analysis of in-use data for heavy-duty diesel tractortrailer vehicles, city transit diesel buses, and dynamometer non-road diesel engines has enabled a determination of diesel engine efficiency and friction and transmission shift schedules for these engines and vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a transistorized PWM inverter-induction motor traction drive system. A vehicle performance analysis was performed to establish the <b>vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> effort-speed requirements. These requirements were then converted into a set of inverter and motor specifications. The inverter was a transistorized three-phase bridge using General Electric power Darlington transistors. The description of the design and development of this inverter is the principal object of this paper. The high-speed induction motor is a design which is optimized for use with an inverter power source. The primary feedback control is a torque angle control with voltage and torque outer loop controls. A current-controlled PWM technique is used to control the motor voltage.

The drive system was dynamometer tested and the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{military}} is constantly expanding {{the use of}} unmanned ground vehicles in warfighting applications that often involve complex environments. Part of the focus of military research is to improve or validate existing routing algorithms which are used to predict vehicle mobility. Routing algorithms {{are based on the}} time required for vehicle movement through a series of obstacles such as trees or fences, thus requiring an assessment of the ability to override such obstacles as compared to finding an alternate maneuver path. The required overriding force can be computed and compared to a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>tractive</b> force to determine the best viable option. If overriding the obstacle is an option (tractive force exceeds the required overriding force), the delay in overriding can be assessed as compared to the delay in maneuvering around the obstacle. This study provides a quick and reasonable calculation of the force required to override specific types of vertically embedded obstacles to support the determination of movement capabilities for unmanned ground vehicles on the battlefield...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of rail and wheel corrugation on vertical and tractive forces is studied, in this paper, for high-speed trains {{with the aim}} of evaluating the risk for surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF). A train-track interaction model for vertical dynamics, which accounts for a prescribed torque on the wheelset and for the highfrequency content of the induced force spectrum, is employed. Corrugation distributions according to ISO 3095 (smooth rail) and as obtained from field measurements (corrugated rail) are considered. A parametric study is carried out in which level of corrugation, <b>tractive</b> effort and <b>vehicle</b> speed are varied. Also the influences of axle load and unsprung mass are investigated. The results are interpreted in terms of rolling contact fatigue impact spectra and by using the Tgamma energy model. If is found that the two models give similar tendencies regarding the surface initiated RCF impact. As expected, the traction effort will dominate the development of RCF, but significant influences are also found for corrugation, speed, axle load and unsprung mass...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adhesion}} {{in the field}} of rail transport represents an ability of tractive force transmission between wheel and rail. Adhesion characteristics is a property of tangential forces transmission between wheel and rail and represents the dependence of tractive force T or adhesion coefficient μ on creep velocity w, or, divided by speed of travel, dependence on relative creep s. The ascending branch of adhesion characteristics is of great importance and acts as one of significant input parameters to drive regulation systems. It is needed to determine value of initial steepness (cTs or cμs) which is defined as an increment of tractive force or adhesion coefficient, respectively, related to a small increment of relative creep. Knowledge on the descending branch is no less important. Thorough understanding of related phenomena and limits of both parts of adhesion characteristics enables an effective exploitation of <b>vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> and braking abilities. A theoretical model of the adhesion mechanism is briefly presented in the introduction to this paper. Following, description of a test stand of a tram wheel driven by a synchronous motor is given, as well as description of experiments conducted by the authors at it. Attention is paid to results of experimental research concerning identification of parameters of the ascending and the descending branch of adhesion characteristics.

40|$|The {{majority}} of fuel consumption models use <b>vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> power and/or velocity as explanatory variables. These models {{appear to be}} simple and easy to implement, however they suffer from two major drawbacks, namely: (a) the use of vehicle specific power results in a bang- bang control (i. e. the optimum fuel consumption results from a full throttle acceleration) if higher orders of power are not considered in the model; and (b) the calibration of the model parameters cannot be done using publicly available data and thus requires field data collection for each vehicle. Consequently, the research {{presented in this paper}} develops two simple fuel consumption models that do not result in a bang-bang control system and that can be calibrated easily using publicly available data. Specifically, the models can be calibrated using the Environmental Protection Agency city and highway fuel economy ratings that are publicly available. The models are demonstrated to estimate vehicle fuel consumption rates consistent with in-field measurements (coefficient of determination above 0. 90). Finally, a procedure for estimating CO 2 emissions is developed producing emission estimates that are highly correlated with field measurements (greater than 0. 98). The development of this model attempts to bridge the existing gap between traditional power-based fuel consumption models and vehicle operational control systems such as fuel-optimized cruise control systems, real-time eco-driving systems, and adaptive cruise control systems on passenger cars using road topography information. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} work focuses on forecasting of performance {{evaluation of the}} <b>tractive</b> and non-tractive <b>vehicles</b> that will satisfy and meet the needs and requirements of the railway industry, which is constantly evolving. Methodology. Analysis of the technical condition of the existing fleet of rolling stock (tractive and non-tractive) of Ukrainian Railways shows a substantial reduction that occurs in connection with its moral and physical wear and tear, as well as insufficient and limited purchase of new units of the tractive and non-tractive rolling stock in the desired quantity. In this situation there is a necessity of search of the methods for determination of rolling stock technical characteristics. One of such urgent and effective measures is to conduct forecasting of the defining characteristics of the vehicles based on the processes of their reproduction in conditions of limited resources using a continuous exponential function. The function of {{the growth rate of}} the projected figure degree for the vehicle determines the logistic characteristic that with unlimited resources has the form of an exponent, and with low ones – that of a line. Findings. The data obtained according to the proposed method allowed determining the expected (future) value, that is the ratio of load to volume of the body for non-tractive rolling stock (gondola cars) and weight-to-power for tractive rolling stock, the degree of forecast reliability and the standard forecast error, which show high prediction accuracy for the completed procedure. As a result, this will allow estimating the required characteristics of vehicles in the forecast year with high accuracy. Originality. The concept of forecasting the characteristics of the vehicles for decision-making on the evaluation of their prospects was proposed. Practical value. The forecasting methodology will reliably determine the technical parameters of tractive and non-tractive rolling stock, which will meet the modern requirements of the railroading, including at the design stage and while upgrading the vehicles...|$|R
40|$|A more {{sustainable}} transportation energy future for society {{is the principal}} motivation of this dissertation. The central purpose of this work is to investigate vehicle technologies that contribute to fuel and emissions reductions while preserving consumer choice, and to evaluate their technological performance and economic practicability as essential aspects of meeting aspirational targets and regulatory requirements associated with the future vehicle fleet. ^ Innovation in automobiles has been realized at stable and affordable prices for decades, yet efforts to intensify future value creation {{in the domain of}} energy efficient technologies are critical. Using analysis of variance and hedonic price modeling techniques, disaggregated contributions of passenger car attributes to vehicle price reveal that consumer valuations of fuel economy move inversely with acceleration performance, and that both are highly correlated to the regulatory context. Novel economic trade-offs among vehicle attributes are introduced, in particular with respect to two foundational premises emphasized by current policies: vehicle classification and weighted sales volume. The implicit value of acceleration is presently greater than that of fuel reduction, with buyers in the significant mid-size vehicle segment willing to pay {{more than twice as much}} for the former than the latter. ^ Building on these findings, the research explores a suite of fuel- and emission-reducing technologies that have underpinned fuel economy gains and compliance at costs that are at or below levels anticipated by the regulations. However, benefit-cost analyses on 2014 model year compact and mid-size cars reveal that consumers are not yet substantially incentivized to purchase fuel economy under baseline scenarios. A sensitivity analysis reveals that a majority of new technologies become financially attractive to consumers when average fuel prices exceed $ 5. 60 /gallon, or when annual miles traveled exceed 16, 400. Turbocharged-downsized engines and hybrid powertrains are found to deliver high incremental benefits compared to their costs. The research suggests that the additional cost consumers incur in exchange for a given level of fuel economy improvement in the coming years will need to be steadily reduced compared to current levels, particularly in the context of low fuel prices. ^ Hybrid and electric vehicles are viewed as enabling technologies, yet their real-world energy consumption is more highly sensitive to driving cycles, ambient temperature, and upstream energy sources than conventional <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>tractive</b> power, and cabin and battery thermal loads are interactively modeled and simulated for a range of operating conditions among vehicles that employ different energy sources and disparate power and thermal management strategies. Locality-specific system-level energy consumption values are then computed based on characteristics of large U. S. cities such as electricity generation, petroleum refining, and typical weather. The findings quantify the extent to which advanced architectures, though favorable in certain modes, are more energy sensitive to driving cycles and extreme temperatures. Annualized integration of this temperature-dependence reveals that system-equivalent energy consumption varies by locality least for internal combustion and hybrid vehicles, and between 45 - 70 % for electric vehicles. As compared to conventional vehicles, electric vehicle system-equivalent CO 2 emissions range from a 70 % improvement to no improvement based on locality. This study suggests that policies and deployment efforts should scientifically account for the strong sensitivity to locality on energy and emissions for advanced vehicles. ^ Regarding fuel reduction objectives, internal combustion engine vehicle baselines show sustained improvement on both technological and economic fronts without compromising consumer choice. Hybrids perform exceptionally well overall, reducing energy and emissions by levels that appear to justify their incremental cost increases. In terms of fuel switching, vehicles operating on grid-electricity are shown to displace petroleum and yield net energy reductions in certain localities; yet future research must navigate technological and cost challenges to ensure energy and emissions benefits are bankable and that policies are well-aligned. This body of work is intended to promote ways of affordably reducing the impact of transportation on the environment, to stimulate further research toward system-level optimizations, and to help inform subsequent policymaking processes regarding the future vehicle fleet. ...|$|R
