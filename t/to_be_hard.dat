Despite his poor {{performance}} as a starter, Croyle's statistics were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to evaluate. With a lack of pass protection {{and the absence of}} a stable starting running back in Larry Johnson, the Chiefs may not have seen Croyle at his best in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are insoluble in alkali {{and less likely to}} contain contaminants from the sample's environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish from the sample material.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber {{developed from}} the Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942. Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E

25|$|DDH is {{considered}} a stronger assumption than discrete log, because there are groups for which detecting DDH tuples is easy, but computing discrete logs is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard.</b> Thus, requiring that the DDH assumption holds in a group is a more restricting requirement.|$|E
25|$|Oyose, {{or large}} yose, {{is a term}} often used in English {{language}} literature. It {{can be used for}} a yose that is large enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to count with precision (say, 20 points or more). It may also be used to refer to the early endgame phase of the game, immediately after middlegame combat, in which the typical yose plays are substantial but were neglected due to pressure elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Form {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to {{find for}} the Phoenix though. Despite scoring {{significant numbers of}} goals, the Phoenix defence proved {{to be anything but}} watertight and high scoring games became a regular occurrence. Manchester closed the regular season on 23 April with a 6–2 away loss to the Hull Stingrays, finishing 7th in the EIHL. This was perceived by many fans to be somewhat of an underachievement by the organisation.|$|E

25|$|A bit of {{the cloth}} was {{radiocarbon}} dated in the late 1980s. It gave as result a 68 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1410 and a 95 percent likelihood of a date between 1290 and 1430. Some uncertainties do however arise as the conservation process might have affected the result. The fact that the find came from a bog is also of concern, as bog finds are known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to date.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{short and long}} term health {{conditions}} that are attributed to alcohol consumption. These harmful conditions over prolonged use are well documented <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to treat and as some of these health conditions result in permanent damage to several vital organs. there remains a very real implication of death due to {{one or more of these}} conditions. Approximately 88,000 deaths have been reported between the years 2006 to 2010 due to excessive alcohol consumption in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{performance}} advantages, {{it turned out}} that no branch of the US Army wanted the new gun. The Infantry considered it too large and heavy. The other possible user, the Tank Destroyer Center, preferred more mobile self-propelled weapons. Finally, pressure from the head of Army Ground Forces, Gen. Lesley McNair, resulted in the gun being adopted by the TD Center. McNair's opinion was apparently influenced by the experience of the North African Campaign, where self-propelled guns were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to conceal.|$|E

25|$|As {{the game}} progressed towards {{professionals}} and became more serious, pitchers began {{to attempt to}} prevent the batter from hitting the ball by throwing faster pitches. With {{the introduction of the}} called strike in , catchers began inching closer to home plate due to the rules requirement that a strikeout could only be completed by a catch. The rules governing the delivery of pitches proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to enforce, and pitchers continued to stretch the boundaries of the rules until the 1870s when the release point of pitches had reached the pitcher's waist level.|$|E

It also contains a story mode that influenced by the player's actions with various perspectives being available. The mode is presented in visual novel style alongside fights, something considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to include in the arcade version by the SNK Playmore staff. Other modes shown are Arcade, Practice and Challenge. The online gameplay {{is based on}} the one included in later versions of The King of Fighters XII, which fixed the issues the initial one had.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Civil War in 1861 took its toll on the library {{collection}}. Members were able to {{remove some of the}} collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove {{what was left of the}} collection. Funds continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.|$|E

25|$|Their {{reasoning}} is that life on Mars is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to find. Any present day life {{is likely to}} be sparse and occur in only a few niche habitats. Past life {{is likely to be}} degraded by cosmic radiation over geological time periods if exposed in the top few meters of the Mars surface. Also, only certain special deposits of salts or clays on Mars would have the capability to preserve organics for billions of years. So, they argue, there is a high risk that a Mars sample return at our current stage of understanding would return samples that are no more conclusive about the origins of life on Mars or present day life than the Martian meteorite samples we already have.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls {{homestead}} in South Dakota {{on a hot}} September day in 1880 as Laura and her father ("Pa") are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers {{that there will be}} seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.|$|E

Billy Kirkwood then signed yet another former Rangers player, Gary McSwegan, from Notts County, and he made his debut in the 1–0 defeat to Dumbarton at Boghead Park. Goals seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to come by in the league, so Kirkwood brought yet another striker to Tannadice. Owen Coyle arrived from Bolton Wanderers and scored on his debut in a 2–1 win over St Johnstone at Tannadice. McSwegan scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 away win over Hamilton, and both strikers scored in a 3–1 win over Dunfermline at Tannadice. United then {{finished}} the month with their 4th straight win with a 3–0 home victory over Clydebank.|$|E
