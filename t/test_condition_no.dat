40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} a simple technique which accounts for aeroelastic deformations experienced by HSR wind-tunnel models within CFD computations. With improved correlations, CFD can become a more effective tool for augmenting the post-test understanding of experimental data. The present technique involves the loose coupling of a low-level structural representation within the ELAPS code, to an unstructured Navier-Stokes flow solver, USM 3 Dns. The ELAPS model is initially calibrated against bending characteristics of the wind-tunnel model. The strength of this method is that, with a single point calibration of a simple structural representation, the static aeroelastic effects can be accounted for in CFD calculations {{across a range of}} <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>No</b> prior knowledge of the model deformation during the wind-on test is required.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Akpan (yoghurt-like product) {{consumption}} {{on the human}} intestinal microbiota was examined. The prebiotic potential of Akpan was assessed by in vitro fermentation using, as inocula, individual probiotic strains and faecal samples from three healthy donors. In this latter case, the prebiotic activity was assessed through the quantification of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, the evolution of the pH and the evaluation of dynamic bacterial population by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Results demonstrated that Akpan was metabolized after 44 [*]h of fermentation, exerting a prebiotic effect, similar to that observed for fructooligosaccharides (FOS). All the considered bacterial groups significantly increased after Akpan and FOS fermentation. Under the <b>tested</b> <b>conditions,</b> <b>no</b> significant differences between the SCFA concentration produced by Akpan and FOS after of incubation were detected.

Because of {{legislation}} and environmental concerns, washing powder manufacturers have phased out phosphate builders {{in favour of}} substitutes such as sodium carbonate. This has meant that the new formulations have a greater tendency towards unwanted agglomeration (caking), based on moisture uptake and migration. This study examines the feasibility of using a Freeman FT 4 powder rheometer to {{examine the effect of}} moisture migration, using the Basic Flow Energy (BFE) value to compare formulations of sodium carbonate content 27 - 37 % and sodium sulphate content 10 - 20 % by mass after 7 days exposure to 80 % relative humidity at 20 °C.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{moderate}} heat treatment combined with calcium dips {{on the quality}} of minimally processed kiwifruit was studied. Whole fruits were treated for 25 min at 45 C by dipping in deionised water or CaCl 2 solutions (1 %, 2 % and 3 % (w/v)) and cooled to 4 C. Twenty-four hours later fruits were peeled, sanitized, cut into slices and packed. The firmness of kiwifruit slices’ was subsequently evaluated during 8 days of storage. Calcium content, pectinmethylesterase activity and heat shock proteins accumulation were also investigated. Heat treatment conducted in water induced a firming effect and avoid softening of fruit slices while calcium dips had a marginal effect on this parameter. A calcium loss was observed due to dip treatment, but this effect was minimized when treatment was conducted in 3 % CaCl 2 solution. The firming effect provided is due to the activation of pectinmethylesterase and the presence of calcium in treatment solution reduces or inhibits enzyme activation.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of different materials under macrotribological and nanotribological conditions has been compared. The materials, hydrogenated amorphous diamondlike carbon, highly ordered pyrolitic graphite, and mica, were {{submitted to a}} fretting test (macrotribological behavior) and a combined atomic force microscopy/lateral force microscopy (AFM/LFM) (nanotribological behavior). The coefficient of friction in the macroscopic regime under fixed experimental conditions considerably changed with the test duration, whereas the friction coefficient measured from the nanoscopic regime was relatively constant during the test. In the macroscopic regime, evident wear, elastoplastic deformation, and material transfer were noticed, while in the nanoscopic regime under the used <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>no</b> wear phenomena were observed. The coefficient of friction showed some dependence on the amplitude and frequency of lateral movement of the sample relative to the counterbody in both the fretting and AFM/LFM tests {{as well as on}} the normal load in the fretting test.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Ashbya gossypii {{is used for}} industrial vitamin B_ 2 (riboflavin) production. Because of their yield-enhancing effect plant oils are the preferred substrates for the biotechnical process. Besides the isocitrate lyase (ICL) as the key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, essential for the degradation of fatty acids, an NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) is localized in preoxisomes of the fungus. The present work addresses the function of this ICDH in the metabolism of A. gossypii concerning riboflavin formation and growth. The AgIDP 3 gene was shown to encode an NADP-specific ICDH by heterologous complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with dysfunctional mitochondrial ICDH isoenzymes. Disruption of the AgIDP 3 gene in A. gossypii resulted {{in the loss of}} about 90 % of enzyme activity in crude extracts. Using both digitonin-mediated protoplast permeabilization and percoll gradient centrifugation it was demonstrated, firstly, that AgIDP 3 coded for a peroxisomal ICDH from A. gossypii.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Participants: Twenty-five healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years. Outcome measures: Distance covered in the 6 MWT (6 MWD) was recorded in metres. Number of turns during the test using walkways of various lengths (10, 20 and 30 m) and different turning directions (turning towards dorminant and non-dorminant side), rate of perceived exertion and heart rate were recorded before and after the test. Results: The 6 MWD and the number of turns differed significantly with walkway length (P < 0. 05). The greatest 6 MWD and the lowest number of turns were recorded in the 30 -m walkway. Significant increases in heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (P < 0. 05) were found between the pre-test and post-test for all <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>No</b> significant difference was found between the two turning directions for any distance covered.

Animal studies looking at the effects of early life and prenatal exposure to this source of electromagnetic fields, in the radiofrequency (RF) range, on development and behavior have been considered as high priority research needs by the World Health Organization. METHODS: For the first time, our study assessed the effects of in utero exposure to a 2450 MHz Wi-Fi signal (2 hr/day, 6 days/week for 18 days) on pregnant rats and their pups. Three levels in terms of whole-body specific absorption rate were used: 0. 08, 0. 4, and 4 W/kg. The prenatal study on fetuses delivered by caesarean (P 20) concerned five females/group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to summarize the primary results of the Hg compatibility research {{in support of the}} SNS target. In the absence of possible synergisms resulting from beam/irradiation effects, wetting of 316 L/ 316 LN stainless steel under SNS conditions by the Hg target is expected to be very limited. As a result, significant interactions such as dissolution, mass transfer, and embrittlement affecting general compatibility are not anticipated. A wide range of experiments on 316 L/ 316 LN stainless steel, including thermal convection and pumped loops, confirmed low corrosion/penetration rates in Hg up to 305 C and little or no wetting or mass transfer below about 250 C. A variety of standard mechanical tests comparing behavior of 316 L in air and Hg revealed limited wetting and no degradation of mechanical properties such as reduced elongation or development of brittle fracture features. Preliminary fatigue tests indicated a negative effect (reduced cycles to failure and intergranular cracking) at very high loads for 316 LN, but little or no effect at more modest loading. Annealed 316 LN was found to be somewhat susceptible to cavitation-erosion damage, but significant improvement was realized with a kolsterizing surface treatment or coldworking the material.

40|$|When {{subjects}} {{stand at}} the center of a fully enclosed room that is rotating at constant velocity, their natural postural sway generates Coriolis forces that destabilize their center of mass and head. We quantitatively assessed how exposure to constant velocity rotation at 10 rpm affected postural control. Twelve subjects stood in a heel-to-toe stance in the rotating room. Each test session involved three phases: (1) pre-rotation, (2) per-rotation, and (3) post-rotation. In each phase, subjects were tested in both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Four measures were used to characterize center of mass movement and head movement: mean sway amplitude, total power, mean power frequency, and frequency of maximum power. Each measure was computed for anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway. Both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral head and center of mass sway during rotation had significantly greater mean sway amplitude and total power compared with pre- and post-rotation values. Mean power frequency and frequency of maximum power were little affected. Eyes open conditions were significantly more stable in all test phases than eyes-closed, but vision did not completely suppress the effects of rotation. The greatest effect of rotation was in the eyes-closed condition with mean sway amplitude and total power increasing more than twofold. Inverted pendulum sway was maintained in all phases of both <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>No</b> aftereffects of rotation were present after the four 25 -s exposures each subject received.

Ten volunteers with no history of shoulder, upper back or neck disorders performed data entry during three <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> (N = <b>no</b> stress; IS = stress induced by work pace reward; ISI = stress induced by work pace reward plus irritation). Each condition was 30 -minutes in length. %RVE (percentage of amplitude of the MES based on a reference contraction) and number of “EMG gaps ” were the independent variables in a repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (p< 0. 05) model that tested for differences between the <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> %RVE and EMG gaps were capable of detecting different types of stressors. The stress response did not elicit an effect on HR however, changes in wpm count were found between <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> N and both IS and ISI...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology, 2007 This study {{examined}} {{the ability of the}} closed gibney with heel locks and figure-of-eights, and the cotton ankle wrap applied using the Louisiana technique followed with an overlay of athletic tape in the same manner in their ability to limit ankle supination during a maximal vertical jump. For this study, 12 athletes from the 2001 - 2002 Humboldt State University intercollegiate men???s basketball participated. Data was collected using 2 D motion analysis software. A repeated measures ANOVA adjusted for multiple comparisons with a Post Hoc Bonferroni was utilized to analyze the differences between the baseline (no ankle support applied), pretest (with the application of support), and posttest (after 15 minutes of exercise) measurements for each of the two <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The data showed the closed gibney significantly reduced ankle supination from the baseline to the pretest measurements (p =. 001). While no significance existed between the baseline to the posttest (p =. 098), there was significance between the baseline and posttest (p =. 003). The cotton ankle wrap showed significance between the baseline and pretest (p =. 002), the pretest and posttest (p =. 024), and the pretest to posttest (p =. 009) measurements. Comparing the two <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> showed <b>no</b> significance between baseline (p = 1. 00), pretest (p = 1. 00), and posttest (p = 1. 00) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} possible differences {{regarding the}} remineralization of predemineralized enamel after exposure to fluoridated or non-fluoridated bleaching gels. Methods: 125 enamel specimens were prepared from sixty three bovine incisors; {{before and after}} demineralization (37 °C; pH 4. 95; 10 d), one-quarter of each specimen’s surface was covered with nail varnish (control sound/demineralized). Subsequently, the specimens were stored for 16 h daily in a remineralizing solution (pH 7. 0; 14 d), while for the remaining time (8 h) various bleaching gels were applied: (1) no treatment (control), (2) Opalescence regular (O; Ultradent), (3) Opalescence PF (O-PF), (4) Nite White ACP (NW-ACP; Discus Dental) and (5) Nite White ACPF (NW-ACPF). Following, half of the bleached parts were nail-varnished and stored for another 3 -weeks period in a remineralizing solution. Differences in mineral losses and lesion depths before and after treatment/remineralization period were evaluated from microradiographs. Additionally, the mineral loss was calculated in the surface layer up {{to a depth of}} 18 µm of the lesion. Results: In comparison with NW-ACP the enamel specimens handled with NW-ACPF displayed after the bleaching in the complete area (p = 0, 04; Bonferroni post-hoc Test) {{as well as in the}} surface layer (p < 0, 001) a significant higher mineral loss. After subsequent remineralization, no significant differences were provable. After treatment with O and O-PF for 2 and 5 weeks in the complete area as well as in the surface layer no significant differences could be observed. Two weeks treatment with O and O-PF resulted in significant higher mineral loss in the surface layer compared to NW-ACP and control (p < 0, 001). Further no significant differences of lesion depth were provable for all groups after 2 (p = 0, 642; ANOVA) and 5 weeks (p = 0, 732). Conclusions: Under the chosen <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>no</b> beneficial influence of sodium fluoride in Opalescence PF and Nite White ACPF could be proved on the remineralization of demineralized bovine enamel in vitro...|$|R
