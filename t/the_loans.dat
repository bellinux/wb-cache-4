Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy.

40|$|We {{construct}} a unified framework to study credit rationing by <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> size. Due to default risk, <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> offer curve is positive-sloping. At the equilibrium interest rate, increasing <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> size reduces <b>the</b> {{average cost of}} <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> so <b>the</b> borrower always demands a larger <b>loan</b> than that <b>the</b> lender can offer even in a perfect credit market. We show that any agency cost may shift <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> offer curve upwards, enlarging the excess demand further. If agency costs are sufficiently high, the borrower is unable to obtain <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> that she needs at any interest rate. This is the common logic underlying the ex-post agency models of credit rationing. ...|$|R

The net result with forfeiture is the producer realizes <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> rate (accrued interest is forgiven) less storage costs. The marketing/promotion assessment is also deducted from <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> proceeds, as is a loan service fee plus any bin measurement fees.
