5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E

25|$|Panels. Panels are {{sheets of}} pre-profiled copper with lengths up to 4–5meters and {{standard}} widths up to 500mm. They are two-sided cladding elements {{that can be}} with or without an end base. Assembly is performed using the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> principle or by overlapping. Panels can be assembled vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There are three basic forms: <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> panels laid vertically as level surface facade cladding; <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> panels laid horizontally as level surface facade cladding; and custom panels laid in different directions with visible or masked fastening, flush against the surface or overlapping. Links to representative photographs of golden-colored and patinated-green panels are available.|$|E

25|$|Inside the sanctuary, {{the floor}} is mosaic. Plaster walls and {{ceilings}} are complemented by dark wood <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> wainscoting and exposed trusses. It is illuminated by 15 stained glass windows.|$|E
25|$|A single wood-paneled door {{leads into}} the church's interior, with a wood floor and coved ceiling. Between them are plaster walls wainscoted with {{horizontal}} <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards topped by molding at the windowsill level. In {{the walls are}} the original metal hardware for placing lanterns.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} comprises six {{rooms with}} the former lounge and dining room to the east separated from four former bedrooms to the west by a central hall and lobby running {{from the front door}} to the kitchen at the rear. The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in wardrobes, drawers and shelving. The walls throughout the house and onto the verandahs have a single lining of vertical v-jointed <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards with ceilings lined in asbestos cement sheeting and finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|This type {{consists}} of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with <b>Tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Grooved</b> boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.|$|R
5000|$|Jointed {{horizontal}} siding (also called [...] "drop" [...] siding or novelty siding) may be shiplapped or <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> (though less common). Drop siding {{comes in}} a wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log siding (milled with curve).|$|R
50|$|The former {{lavatory}} {{block is}} a timber framed {{building with a}} concrete floor and corrugated iron gambrel roof. Its walls originally lined with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> pine boards have been sheeted on the exterior with fibrous cement sheeting. The building is presently divided with a central timber partition and is unoccupied.|$|R
25|$|Sima and Crowning tiles belong together. They were {{connected}} {{by use of}} the <b>Tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> method. On top of the sima was a tongue which was inserted into {{the underside of the}} crowning tile. The sima joined the cladding tile with an egg and dart pattern, a smooth strip was left on the underside. Waterspouts could be incorporated into the sima. The crowning tiles usually feature ornamental, floral patterns. They were equipped with slots on the underside, into which the sima was inserted. Together, the two tile types found use as the eaves of the roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{front door}} {{is located on}} the {{southwest}} well of the building, and is of vertical <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> construction, measuring six feet, two inches tall by two feet, ten inches wide. To the west of the door are four horizontal two-over-three sash windows, each window measuring eight inches tall by ten inches wide. The gable has enclosed eaves and reaches eleven feet in height. The first addition increased the length of this side of the structure by almost fourteen feet, and includes two casement windows with two-over-two sash {{on this side of the}} building. Each of the windows is ten inches tall by eight inches wide.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} is {{a robust}} single storey timber-framed building clad in chamferboards. Standing on a red-coloured concrete slab on fill it {{is covered by}} a low-pitched hipped corrugated sheet roof with half round ridge tiles and quad gutters, all of asbestos cement. Verandahs located on {{the north and east}} sides are supported on pairs of 150mm square posts finished with skirtings and capitals on capped concrete upstands. Along the verandahs, projecting porches with gabled hips distinguish the entrances when viewed from the main garden and driveway. The verandah walls and interior partition walls have exposed frames lined with vertical v-jointed <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards and ceilings are lined with asbestos cement sheeting finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
2500|$|The first font {{was built}} out of <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> white pine <b>and</b> painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an [...] "antique style" [...] and the sides were {{finished}} with panel work. Two railed stairways led to the font {{from the north and}} south sides.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sections}} of the building are clad internally with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boarding. The ceilings which {{are in the same}} material follow the rafter line {{to the bottom of the}} collar ties where they become flat. The 1897 building contains offices; the Court Room retains elements of early furniture that include the Judges bench, dock, reporters benches and clerks tables. The interior of the Court Room also displays the trade certificate of the carpenter.|$|R

25|$|Within the Monck Wing, built between 1865 and 1866, {{are other}} living {{quarters}} and drawing and dining rooms generally for non-state affairs, {{such as the}} Pauline Vanier Room, a small sitting room where informal meetings are held with visiting heads of state and other officials. The room was originally created in the 1960s by Pauline Vanier out of an old aide-de-camp smoking room, giving the space pine panelling and filling it with antique furnishings from Quebec. However, it was later again refurbished to remove the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> planks Vanier had installed and which {{were said to be}} reminiscent of suburban basement panelling popular in the 1970s. The Pauline Vanier Room today contains furniture and other cabinetry works by Canadian artisans.|$|E
25|$|The rear of {{the cabin}} faces {{northeast}} and contains a door and two sets of windows. Nearest the northwest corner are two windows of horizontal two-over-two sash construction, each measuring ten inches high by sixteen inches wide. Next to the windows are the door which leads into the kitchen, being 6 feet, 2 inches high by 2 feet, ten inches wide; like the front door it is also <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> construction, although at a 45 degree angle. A wooden porch with three steps leads up to the door, and measures four feet, six inches wide. On {{the other side of}} the door are a sequence of five windows looking into the art studio. Each window is ten inches high by eight inches wide, and are horizontal three-over-three sash. The southeast side of the structure has door entering the art studio. There are three horizontal three-over-three sash windows which look into the original room of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and hatchways in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use). Signage and a safety strap on the top ladder have been introduced since restoration of the structure in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} was of simple single planks, nailed with brads into 8 by 2 in soft wood joists. The joists ends {{were treated with}} bitumin, and sunk half a brick deep into the walls. Later with wider spans the joist would be {{supported}} by stub walls. The floor planks later were <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> (T&G) to reduce draughts. The scullery was a wet area with a flagstone floor slightly lower {{than the rest of}} the house.|$|R
2500|$|The font, {{built of}} <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> white pine, was painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide, and four feet deep. The {{lip of the}} font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an [...] "antique style" [...] and the sides were {{finished}} with panel work. Two railed stairways led to the font {{from the north and}} south sides. A well {{on the east side of}} the font provided the water supply.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the radial arm saw, but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The radial arm saw can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the radial arm saw can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut <b>tongues</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooves,</b> <b>and</b> make variable dadoes. Like the {{compound miter saw}}, the radial arm saw can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|R
25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} is a timber-framed structure clad in corrugated iron, standing twelve metres {{high and}} capped with a domed lantern. The tower is conical in form with a base diameter of approximately 4.3 metres reducing to a top diameter of 2.26 metres. It has been reinstalled at its original location on a round concrete slab {{placed over the}} top of the original 1896 footing when it was returned from Golden Beach in 1999. Corrugations in the iron sheeting taper inwards for the full height of the tower. Most exterior sheeting is early, slip-sheeted in places with zinc sheeting to repair rusted sections. A small timber-framed entry projects from the northern side, clad in corrugated iron with an arched corrugated iron roof. The door is made from <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> boards on a timber frame. Four small, rectangular windows provide daylight to the interior – two at ground level and two corresponding to the level of the central interior platform. They are vertical sliders, framed with cedar and weather-proofed on the exterior by lead flashing. The exterior of the tower is painted white, with the exception of a red border on the entry door.|$|E
500|$|Warriors armour {{consisted}} of [...] of wrought iron backed by [...] of teak. The iron armour {{was made up}} of [...] plates that interlocked via the <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> method. It was bolted through the teak to the iron hull. The teak {{consisted of}} two [...] layers laid at right angles to each other; they strengthened the armour by damping the shock waves caused by the impact of shells that would otherwise break the bolts connecting the armour to the hull. Based on tests at Shoeburyness in October 1861 when the Warrior was launched, it [...] "was practically invulnerable to the ordnance at the time in use".|$|E
500|$|The gun {{ports of}} the Warrior-class ships were built [...] wide, which allowed the 68-pounders to {{traverse}} 52°. While the ships were building the directing bar was developed {{which consisted of}} an iron bar that fastened to a pivot bolt in the sill of the gun port. After the gun carriages were modified, this allowed them to pivot {{much closer to the}} gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of [...] while retaining the same arc of fire. The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by [...] of wrought iron. Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour-piercing shells. All together these modifications delayed the completion of Warrior by a year past her contract completion date.|$|E
50|$|The Matron's {{flat and}} {{household}} workers' quarters is a timber framed building lined with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> pine elevated on timber stumps. The verandahs {{are lined with}} fibrous cement sheeting to sill height with venetian blinds above. The Matron's flat, contained a verandah, office, bedroom, lounge, vestibule, front hall and bathroom. The Household workers' quarters contained a hallway, bedroom, sewing room, dining room, lounge, and back and side verandahs. All internal partition walls have been removed and the building {{was used as a}} kitchen until recently and is now unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} is {{accessed}} via a timber half turn stair {{that has turned}} newel posts and turned balusters. The stair rises to a landing which has corridors leading off in three directions. These lead to accommodation rooms through four panel timber doors. The rooms are divided with vertical timber <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boards mounted on an exposed timber post and rail frame. Each room opens onto the verandah via timber French doors. The south east and south west sections of the verandah has been enclosed for toilets and showers.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is almost square in plan, with verandahs on four sides, partially enclosed {{on the southern}} and western sides. The corrugated iron gabled roof is punctuated with three dormer windows each on the tapering northern and southern sides. The gable ends of the buildings feature narrow timber balconies, with hipped awnings, flanked by multi pane casement windows. Overhanging eaves and the decorative barge boards of the gables are supported on paired timber fretwork brackets. The single skinned external walls of the principal {{floor of the house}} are cross braced. Gable ends are clad with chamfered timber boards, and the underneath of the {{building is}} clad with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boarding.|$|R
500|$|The church {{interior}} has an {{open floor}} plan, with a sanctuary measuring [...] wide and [...] long. The floor plan {{is an open}} nave, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its lower hopper sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors, which access an unadorned narthex. Two tapered-square pilasters support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade, accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels.|$|E
500|$|The Zafimaniry {{inhabit the}} heavily forested, rainy and {{temperate}} {{region of the}} Highlands {{to the east of}} Ambositra. [...] Their homes are rectangular and large (15' long, 12' wide and 18' high) with a peaked roof, overhanging eaves, and wooden windows and doors. [...] Many of the same standards found in the aristocratic architectural traditions of Imerina are present in the Zafimaniry structures, including the central wooden pillar supporting the roof beam, exclusive use of a <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> joining technique and the orientation of building features such as windows, doors and the interior layout. Zafimaniry houses are often elaborately decorated with carved, symmetrical, abstract patterns that are rich in complex spiritual and mythological symbolism. [...] The architecture of the houses found in this region are considered to be representative of the architectural style that predominated throughout the Highlands prior to deforestation, and as such, they represent the last vestiges of a historic tradition and a significant element of Malagasy cultural heritage. [...] For this reason, the woodcrafting knowledge of the Zafimaniry was added in 2003 to the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden hulled Aetna {{class had}} [...] "straight {{vertical}} sides and a flat bottom {{with a very}} bluff bow and stern. Their armour plates, nominally 4in [...] {{but in many cases}} rolled 0.25-0.5in under thickness, were locked together with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> joints." [...] The iron armour was supported by [...] thick oak sides. The wooden upper deck was [...] thick. [...] There were two conning towers protected by [...] wrought iron plate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding <b>tongues</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooves,</b> <b>and</b> runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 1887 {{section of}} the building is roughly square in plan, with walls that are mainly of plaster-rendered brickwork. Some remnants of the original lath-and-plaster timber-framed interior partition walls survive on the upper floor level. Ceilings and soffits throughout the building are lined with 125 mm beaded tongue & groove boarding; however a timber-framed dropped ceiling, sheeted in plasterboard has been introduced at ground level in some areas. Floors throughout the building are 100mm hardwood <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boards that have been overlaid with carpet at the ground level and vinyl tiles at the upper level. Some original cedar doors and architraves have survived. Two fireplaces, formerly located on the building northern wall, have both been bricked up and their surrounds removed.|$|R
5000|$|Construction ran {{smoothly}} {{during the}} latter half of 1888 and Scholefield recorded that he [...] "commenced to reside" [...] at Weetwood on 1 January 1889. The house was named after his father's home in Leeds, England, and the premises included a lawn tennis court and stables described by Scholefield's daughter as [...] "beautifully built with <b>tongue</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> hardwood timber, <b>and</b> consisting ... of three horse stalls, a large buggy shed for two buggies, a harness room, a feed room, and a man's room". On the 6 acres of land the Scholefields also maintained a paddock for horses and cows as well as a fowl yard. The large garden included a variety of fruit trees and vegetables, which was attended to by a full-time gardener, George Smith, who was with the family for 20 years.|$|R
