5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on <b>the</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem.

5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony.

P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground.
