On the east side of town, it connects to the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad, a short line. Trains serving Lock Haven carry only freight. The City of Lock Haven operates the William T. Piper Memorial Airport, a general aviation facility with a paved runway, runway lighting, paved taxiways, a <b>tie-down</b> area, and hangar spaces. No commercial, charter, or freight services are available at this airport.|$|E
25|$|Polo is ridden {{with double}} reins for greater {{accuracy}} of signals. The bit is frequently a gag bit or Pelham bit. In both cases, the gag or shank rein {{will be the}} bottom rein in the rider's hands, while the snaffle rein will be the top rein. If a gag bit is used, {{there will be a}} drop noseband in addition to the cavesson, supporting the <b>tie-down.</b> One of the rein sets may alternately be draw reins.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, a number of cities and states, mostly in {{the eastern half of}} the United States, have passed ordinances and laws governing rodeo. Pittsburgh, for example, specifically prohibits electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels. Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go—specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens. The state of Rhode Island has banned <b>tie-down</b> roping and certain other practices.Other locales have similar ordinances and laws.|$|E

25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and hatchways in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and <b>tie-down</b> brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use). Signage and a safety strap on the top ladder have been introduced since restoration of the structure in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The <b>tie-down</b> is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E

500|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen 40-caliber [...] Type 89 dual-purpose guns in twin mounts on sponsons {{along the sides of}} the hull. Hiyō was also initially equipped with eight triple 25mm Type 96 light AA guns alongside the flight deck. In early 1943, four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts were added late in the year. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island. A dozen single mounts were also added, some of which were portable and could be mounted on <b>tie-down</b> points on the flight deck.|$|E
500|$|Other {{examples}} include Gordie Howe's tactic {{of holding the}} sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time Buffalo Sabres enforcer Rob Ray to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with <b>tie-down</b> straps ("fight straps") that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Rob Ray Rule".|$|E
500|$|The main ground force {{earmarked}} {{for the operation}} was the US Seventh Army, commanded by Alexander Patch. The army's VI Corps, commanded by Major General Lucian Truscott, would carry out the initial landing and was {{to be followed by}} the French ArmyB under command of Général Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. Accompanying the operation was a fully mobilized separate detachment called [...] "Task Force Butler", consisting of the bulk of the Allied tanks, tank destroyers, and mechanized infantry. In addition, the French Resistance {{played a major role in}} fighting. With the Allied advance in France the Resistance increasingly organized itself and evolved from a guerilla fighting force to a semi-organized army called French Forces of the Interior. The FFI would <b>tie-down</b> numerous German troops by sabotaging bridges and communication lines, seizing important traffic hubs and directly attacking isolated German forces. They were aided by Allied special forces from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) who would then supply the Allies with vital intelligence information.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons {{along the sides of}} the hull. They fired [...] projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a muzzle velocity of at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and a maximum ceiling of [...] The ships were also initially equipped with eight triple 25mm Type 96 light AA guns alongside the flight deck. They fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of [...] at +85°. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. In mid-1943, four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts in late 1943–early 1944. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island. A dozen single mounts were also added, some of which were portable and could be mounted on <b>tie-down</b> points on the flight deck. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, Junyōs anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with three more triple mounts, two twin mounts and 18 single mounts for the 25mm Type 96 gun. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. Each [...] rocket weighed [...] and had a maximum velocity of [...] Their maximum range was [...] In October 1944, Junyō had a total of 91 25mm barrels; 57 in 19 triple mounts, four in two twin mounts, and 30 single mounts.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{the form}} most {{commonly}} used for aircraft <b>tie-down.</b> [...] One taut-line hitch is tied 15–30cm from the aircraft and adjusted for tension, then a second taut-line hitch is tied 5–20cm further from the aircraft and finished with a half-hitch. [...] Wind-induced lift tends to pull the knot tighter, gust-induced oscillations tend to damp-out, and once the half hitch is undone, pushing the lower working rope up easily releases both hitches even amid icing.|$|E

2500|$|From 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set {{was issued}} to some generals in the US Army.

2500|$|Calf Roping, {{also called}} <b>Tie-down</b> roping, {{is based on}} ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. [...] A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth {{major change}} {{came in the}} 1966–67 season, when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new flag of Canada to commemorate the Canadian Centennial. Before the 1970–71 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a Kabel bold-font [...] "Toronto" [...] going {{straight}} across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater removed the arm stripes, extended the yoke {{to the end of}} the sleeves, added a solid stripe on the waist, three stripes on the stockings and a miniature Leaf crest on the shoulders. In 1973, the jersey's neck was a lace <b>tie-down</b> design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, player names were added to the away jerseys and in 1979 to the home jerseys, but not until after the Leafs were fined by the NHL for refusing to comply with a new rule.|$|E

50|$|There are no {{specific}} bits required for barrel racing, although some bits {{are more common}} to barrel racers. The type used is determined by an individual horse's needs. Bits with longer shanks cause the horse to stop quicker than normal due to the additional leverage on the mouth/jaw, while bits with shorter shanks are used for more lateral work. Curb chains, nosebands, and <b>tie-downs</b> {{can be used in}} conjunction with the bit. Curb chains are primarily used for rate. <b>Tie-downs</b> give the horse a sense of security when stopping and turning.|$|R
2500|$|Rodeo ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{competitive}} sport that arose {{out of the}} working practices of cattle herding in Spain, Mexico, and later Central America, South America, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It {{was based on the}} skills required of the working vaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western Canada, and northern Mexico. Today it is a sporting event that involves horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and speed of the cowboys and cowgirls. American style professional rodeos generally comprise the following events: <b>tie-down</b> roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding and barrel racing. [...] The events are divided into two basic categories: the rough stock events and the timed events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region, other events such as breakaway roping, goat tying, or pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos.|$|E
2500|$|A rules dispute {{during the}} first all-cowgirl rodeo, in 1948 in Amarillo, Texas, led to the {{formation}} of the first rodeo association for women. [...] The dispute, during the calf roping event, concerned a lack of standard rules for the event and {{led to the formation}} of the Girls Rodeo Association (GRA) which boasted 74 members and produced one rodeo in its first year. [...] In 1979 the organization was 2,000 strong with 15 sanctioned rodeos. [...] In 1981, the GRA became the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) and worked successfully with local rodeo promoters and the PRCA to make women's barrel racing a standard event in most PRCA rodeos. [...] WPRA events are barrel racing, bareback bronc riding, bull or steer riding, team roping, calf roping (both break-away and <b>tie-down),</b> goat tying, and steer un-decorating [...] a contest in which the mounted cowgirl grabs a ribbon from the steer's neck rather than leaping from her horse and wrestling the steer to the ground. Today, only a fraction of WPRA members compete in the women's rodeos, preferring instead to hit the PRCA rodeos where the purses are larger.|$|E
