She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Popotan {{follows a}} semi-predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but {{personal}} storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> and their maid in a mansion near {{the ruins of}} Tokyo in the distant future.

The second adoptee, Bolissa, was given to them by her father, who had carried her {{all the way from}} Syria; her mother had died en route. Bolissa was killed in the 1948 Ben Yehuda Street bombing.

5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Brinkley {{left his}} family to try to regain the thread of his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> home to North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
5|$|Never 7 {{takes place}} in the week of April 1–7, 2019. Makoto Ishihara, the protagonist, is a college student and truant who rarely attends his classes. As a result, he is forced to attend a seminar camp being held on a remote island in order to be allowed to pass to his next grade. Three other {{students}} are at the camp: Yuka Kawashima, the leader of the group; Haruka Higuchi, a quiet girl who is an ace student; and Okuhiko Iida, a wealthy playboy who is the heir of the Iida Financial Group. Makoto also meets <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> unrelated to the seminar camp: a wealthy girl named Saki Asakura; and the sisters Kurumi and Izumi Morino, who are temporarily running the café Lunabeach on the island. The seven find they cannot leave the island due to a tropical cyclone that makes the boats unable to leave for a whole week, and become friends during the week.|$|E
5|$|Pentangle {{reached their}} highest point of {{commercial}} {{success with the}} release of their Basket of Light album in 1969. The single, Light Flight, taken from the album became popular through its use as theme music for a TV drama series Take <b>Three</b> <b>Girls</b> for which the band also provided incidental music. In 1970, at the peak of their popularity, they recorded a soundtrack for the film Tam Lin, made at least 12 television appearances, and undertook tours of the UK, including the Isle of Wight Festival, and America, including a concert at Carnegie Hall). However, their fourth album, Cruel Sister, released in October 1970, was a commercial disaster. This was an album of traditional songs that included a 20-minute-long version of Jack Orion, a song that Jansch and Renbourn had recorded previously as a duo on Jansch's Jack Orion album.|$|E

5|$|Struthers {{was one of}} six children, {{three boys}} and <b>three</b> <b>girls.</b> The boys were privately tutored in the classics, {{mathematics}} and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. They went out boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby Firth of Forth, and went for long walks with wealthy friends. Both his older brother James {{and his younger brother}} Alexander studied medicine. James Struthers became a doctor at Leith; Alexander Struthers died of cholera while serving as a doctor in the Crimean War. His sisters Janet and Christina provided a simple education at Brucefield for some poor friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833–1908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{series is}} mainly {{based on the}} short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a {{slightly}} lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the <b>three</b> <b>girls</b> that they each are or become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in {{the election of the}} new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. Fan service, or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} of nine children (six boys and <b>three</b> <b>girls),</b> Hassett {{was born in}} Newtown, a suburb of Geelong, Victoria's second-largest city. His father Edward was {{a real estate agent}} who served as the secretary of the Geelong Permanent Building Society and was a keen club cricketer. The Hassett boys played three-a-side cricket matches in the backyard where Lindsay imitated his idol, the Test batsman Bill Ponsford. Along with two of his brothers, Lindsay attended Geelong College and made the First XI at the age of 14. During his five years in the team, he amassed 2,335 runs and was captain for three years. This total included an innings of 245 against Scotch College. In addition, he led the school's football team for three seasons and won the Victorian Public Schools singles championship at tennis. An elder brother, Richard, played for Victoria in the early 1930s as a leg spinner.|$|E
