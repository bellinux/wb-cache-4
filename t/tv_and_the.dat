5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the <b>TV</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment.

Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
