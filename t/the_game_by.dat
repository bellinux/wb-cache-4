5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{earned a}} bid to the Independence Bowl {{following}} an 83 record during the 1984-1985 football season. Tech was the No. 3 team {{in the country in}} terms of overall defense and No. 2 in terms of rushing defense, due to the efforts of Tech defender Bruce Smith, an All-American and Outland Trophy winner who would later go on to be the first-overall selection in the 1985 NFL Draft. Smith became the centerpiece of an eligibility debate during the weeks prior to the game, as he was at first prohibited from participating in <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>by</b> the NCAA, which had placed him under probation for accepting illegal gifts.

Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
