5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa {{attempts to make}} friends with a new girl, Francine (who is much larger and tougher than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E

5|$|Valve Corporation is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher founded in 1996 by Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. The company is currently based in Bellevue, Washington. Valve's first game was Half-Life, a first-person shooter released in 1998. It received universal acclaim and sold over 9 million units in retail. Alongside Half-Lifes launch, Valve released development tools {{to enable the}} player community to create content and mods. The company then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> creators of popular mods, such as Counter-Strike, which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Unreal Tournament consisted of around 16 people. Most team members {{had worked on}} Unreal, though Epic hired {{a number of new}} developers to reinforce the team. Programmer Brandon Reinhart was one such hire, joining Epic in August 1998 to help with the support of Unreal and the development of Unreal Tournament. In December 1998, Reinhart discovered an Unreal mod called UBrowser, which provided a new user interface for finding multiplayer matches. After showing it to James Schmalz, the lead designer at Digital Extremes, Schmalz decided <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> mod's author, Jack Porter. After only a few weeks Porter was already working with the team, replacing the game's existing menu system with his new interface. Epic founder Tim Sweeney worked on improving the networking code along with Steve Polge, who also wrote the original AI code and focused on player physics and general gameplay. Erik de Neve was responsible for the LOD character rendering, and various extra optimizations.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E

5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson's withdrawal, Humphrey was {{hit with}} a barrage of media {{interest}} and fanfare. His aides Max Kampelman and Bill Connell began to set up an organization and held meetings with Humphrey and his advisors, encouraging him to start a campaign. Humphrey set up offices for preparation, and unsuccessfully courted Larry O'Brien as campaign manager. O'Brien explained that his loyalties lied with the Kennedy family, leaving Humphrey undecided on whom to hire. Connell added lawyer and former DNC Treasurer Richard McGuire, who established the temporary campaign headquarters at his law firm. Eventually, Humphrey decided to embrace the youth of politics, adding Senators Fred R. Harris and Walter Mondale, who agreed to lead the Democrats United for Humphrey organization. Harris was put in charge of winning delegates, and Mondale prepared for the convention, helping to keep an organization in place. Kampelman, Connell and McGuire questioned Humphrey's decision <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> Senators, explaining that they had no organizational experience. Humphrey worried about his organization in the state of Iowa, but Harris and Mondale assured him that what would be lost in the state would be made up in Maryland. The campaign believed they could build a coalition of southern and border state Democrats as well as Union and Civil rights leaders to win the nomination. Mondale and Harris also desired to add a few anti-war liberals to the coalition. Meanwhile, Humphrey's office constantly received calls urging him to announce. Congressman Hale Boggs and Senator Russell Long, both of Louisiana, warned Humphrey that if he did not declare his candidacy soon, Kennedy would secure the nomination. Labor leader George Meany also called for Humphrey to announce immediately, but when Humphrey explained {{that he did not want}} to rush into a campaign, Meany called President Johnson to demand that Humphrey announce. Johnson refused, and never explicitly asked Humphrey to run. Governors Harold Hughes of Iowa and Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, each advised Humphrey to resign as Vice President to separate himself from Johnson, but he declined. Before the official announcement, Humphrey met with Johnson and discussed the future. The President advised Humphrey that his biggest obstacle as a candidate would be money and organization, and that he must focus on the Midwest and Rust Belt states in order to win.|$|E

25|$|Chester began {{losing its}} {{mainstay}} shipyard and automobile manufacturing jobs {{as early as}} the 1960s, causing the population to be halved in fifty years from over 66,000 in 1950 to under 34,000 in 2010. Poverty and crime rose as the city declined. In 1995, the state designated Chester as a financially distressed municipality. Soon thereafter, the city's schools ranked last among the state's 501 districts, leading Pennsylvania education officials in 2001 <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> for-profit Edison Schools to run the local school district for three years.|$|E

Green flew with Continental for 13 years from 1965 until his retirement in 1978. His employment {{paved the way for the}} hiring of ethnic-minority pilots by all U.S. carriers, an industry milestone which was finally realized in 1977 after Southern Airways and Piedmont Airlines hired their first minority pilots.|$|E

25|$|Cesare was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} papal armies {{with a number of}} Italian mercenaries, supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry sent by the King of France. Alexander sent him to capture Imola and Forlì, ruled by Caterina Sforza (mother of the Medici condottiero Giovanni dalle Bande Nere). Despite being deprived of his French troops after the conquest of those two cities, Borgia returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph and to receive the title of Papal Gonfalonier from his father. In 1500 the creation of twelve new cardinals granted Alexander enough money for Cesare <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> condottieri, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Giulio and Paolo Orsini, and Oliverotto da Fermo, who resumed his campaign in Romagna.|$|E
