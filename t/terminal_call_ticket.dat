40|$|ABSTRACT Each {{physical}} device {{attached to a}} node {{in a data network}} has corresponding call pro-cesses that run within the node; specifically, within a control computer in the node. A call process is responsible for the set-up and take-down of calls to and from a device. Call processes are typically complex state machines that react to hardware signals and user input. This paper describes an implementation of a <b>terminal</b> <b>call</b> process in Esterel, aspecial language designed for programming reactive systems. We conclude that Esterel allows clear and concise code specifications for <b>terminal</b> <b>call</b> processes; furthermore, thespecifications compile into implementations. 1 INTRODUCTION In the TDK system [5], a typical <b>call</b> from a <b>terminal</b> to a host computer proceeds as follows: The terminal supplies the name of the host to be called. TDK establishes a connection...|$|R
