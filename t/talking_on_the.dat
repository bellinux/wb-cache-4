5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the station}}, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone about Mona. Suddenly, {{the station is}} {{attacked}} by the Cleaners, {{who are looking for}} Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend themselves against the Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E

5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

25|$|The {{results on}} the inquiry were {{released}} on 25 November 2014 three months later. Ms Gwyn found that the SIS gave information to John Key's office from where his {{deputy chief of staff}} Phil de Joux passed it on to another John Key employee, Jason Ede. Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the information should be worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff. Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
500|$|Borislow {{bought a}} $1.8 million {{yearling}} in September 1999 that he named Talk Is Money. The thoroughbred {{was named after}} Tel-Save, with Borislow saying, [...] "Every time someone was <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, I made money." [...] Talk Is Money's best finish came at the Tesio Stakes in April 2001, where the horse placed second. This qualified him for the 2001 Kentucky Derby, and Borislow hired jockey Jerry Bailey, who won the 2000 Breeders Cup Juvenile with Macho Uno. At 47-1 odds, Talk Is Money came in last in the Derby and did not finish the race.|$|E

500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just people <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine {{how it could be}} done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E

In Oklahoma, high winds in excess of [...] caused major damage to five to six barns in Cherokee and destroyed one barn in Ingersoll. Three people were injured in Frontenac, Kansas after a tree was blown down on a vehicle. The next day, the inclement weather moved into the Mid-Atlantic States. A 57-year-old man was killed in Annandale, Virginia after a large tree crushed his vehicle. More than 250,000customers lost power in Virginia. Washington Monument State Park suffered extensive damage after thunderstorms knocked out phone, electricity, and water service. Fallen trees and branches blocked the main road and the hiking trail to the monument in several places. The museum and water treatment buildings were severely damaged, and as a result, the park was closed for two weeks. A total 70severe thunderstorm, marine, and tornado warnings were issued in the Baltimore/Washington region. In Bloomington, Indiana, two people had lightning strikes near them and {{were taken to the}} hospital for lighting related injuries.

500|$|The pair {{discussed}} {{having an}} Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. [...] The lyrics for that scene {{proved to be}} very difficult for Hammerstein to write. [...] He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as [...] "I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" [...] and [...] "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)." [...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone about other matters, {{and at the end of}} the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. [...] Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. [...] It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.|$|E

He put the onus of his party's coalition partner, saying, [...] "Whether it is MNS violence in the signboard or dalit killing at Khairlanji it shows an insensitive administration. The NCP president Sharad Pawar should seriously reflect on the working of the state home department." [...] Even NCP leaders including Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal have told RR Patil and Deshmukh, in the cabinet meet to [...] "either act or shut up". Suggesting that the Maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against MNS chief Raj Thackeray, the NDA on Thursday described as [...] "stage-managed show" [...] the arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north Indians in the state. BJP MP Shahnawaz Hussain said, [...] "Congress is Raj Thackeray's event management company and it is trying to project Raj's arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check the violent campaign of MNS against north Indians. There is match-fixing between Raj and the Maharashtra government. The state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail." [...] <b>Talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attacks on North Indian candidates at the All-India Railway Recruitment examinations in Mumbai, Rajya Sabha MP and JD-U national general secretary Shivananda Tiwari also attacked Congress for [...] "promoting" [...] the MNS chief and comparing him with slain Punjab separatist leader Bhindarwale. [...] "Congress party has a mastery in creating 'bhasmasurs' (self destructing demons). Earlier they created Bhindranwale in Punjab, which killed a Congress Prime Minister. Even this Raj Thackeray is ultimately going to damage Congress," [...] Tiwari claimed. He also alleged that Maharashtra government arrested Raj to carry out a [...] "formality" [...] and as mild charges were pressed, he got bail soon.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of BeyoncÃ© paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of BeyoncÃ© gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on {{what happens in the}} video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E
