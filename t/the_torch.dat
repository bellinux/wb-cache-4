5|$|Week of Welcome, usually {{held the}} first or second week of the Fall {{semester}} holds many spirit events, such as Trail of <b>the</b> <b>Torch.</b> Trail of <b>the</b> <b>Torch</b> is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a pep rally is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> of knowledge is lit and blue and gold candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> from the Housing Quad to <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and Homecoming Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Torches</b> have {{appeared}} in the CFA state title game four times, hosting the championship game in 2000. Until 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Torches</b> football program had advanced to the post-season playoffs each year since the program's inception. <b>The</b> <b>Torches</b> have won two CFA state titles. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Torches</b> won their first, beating Tuscaloosa Christian 58-12. The second came in 2011 when <b>the</b> <b>Torches</b> beat North River Christian Academy 52-22. This win completed the first ever perfect season for <b>the</b> <b>Torches</b> ending with an 11-0 record.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>torches</b> run on turpentine. Turpentine {{is used in}} <b>the</b> <b>torches</b> {{because it}} burns {{brighter}} than kerosene. People don't use turpentine in lamps because it is far too volatile {{to be used in}} that manner.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, <b>the</b> <b>torches</b> are {{structurally}} stable {{at their}} restored location; new mounts were bolted into the limestone bases, not directly attached to <b>the</b> <b>torches</b> but merely holding {{them in place}} underneath. At {{the time of this}} most recent installation the bronze was completely discolored by verdigris and black corrosion film. This splotchy appearance made the overall shape of the lampposts and the designs within the intricate bronze-work difficult to fully appreciate. Thus, the IMA Conservation Department performed a treatment on <b>the</b> <b>torches</b> following installation, thoroughly cleaning away most of the corrosion and applying multiple protective coatings of wax to <b>the</b> <b>torches</b> to protect them from further corrosion.|$|R
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder moves <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> in a {{small circle}} to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} torch relay {{route and}} celebration sites were announced on February 24, 2015. <b>The</b> <b>torch</b> arrived in Toronto and then headed to Thunder Bay, before visiting all other communities on the route. The relay also visited five National Historic Sites of Canada, six Canadian Forces bases and one provincial park. There were 180 celebrations across <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> relay route.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{consists}} of a gold torch that represents liberty and enlightenment; the rays around <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> represent their far-reaching influence. The nineteen stars represent Indiana's place as the nineteenth state to join the United States.

From Beijing, <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. <b>The</b> <b>torch</b> visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China {{and the rest of}} the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> bearer {{approaches}} the Olympic Stadium he collapses, and the Doctor promptly and suddenly appears, picks up <b>the</b> <b>torch,</b> and completes the run {{to light the}} Olympic Flame. The heat of the flame and the emotion of the crowd power the pod, allowing the Isolus to leave Chloe and return home. The Doctor and Rose walk off to watch the games, and Rose remarks that nothing will ever split {{the two of them}} up. The Doctor becomes uneasy and muses that a storm is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Torch</b> {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of <b>the</b> <b>torch.</b> Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> and succeeded.|$|E

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|The ship dropped <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> off in Bari at 12:30pm on 19 July. It was run north {{through several}} Italian cities before {{crossing}} the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From {{there it was}} run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at Saint-Julien-en-Genevois. The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey. That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as {{the pressure of the}} crowds on <b>the</b> <b>torch</b> carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E
