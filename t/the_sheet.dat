5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

40|$|Self-supported diamond <b>sheets</b> of <b>the</b> {{thickness}} {{ranging from}} 15 to 30 mum were prepared using hot filament {{chemical vapor deposition}} technique.

Routine characterization of <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Positron annihilation spectroscopy techniques. Detailed measurements of room temperature electrical conductivity (sigma (300)), current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, and annealing studies on <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> deposited with various structural disorder have yielded useful information about the electrical conduction in this interesting material. sigma (300) and I-V characteristic measurements were done in sandwiched configuration taking care off the surface effects. <b>The</b> diamond <b>sheets</b> deposited at low deposition pressure (P-d 1, in high voltage range.

5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller sheet of bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> of AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{aging and}} {{protection}} are of crucial interest {{for improving the}} preservations of library collections and archives. Highly aging-resistant cellulose fiber sheets were obtained by treatment with magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg(OH) 2). The procedure was tested on <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> made of bleached (B) and refined unbleached (UB) pine cellulose fibers {{as well as their}} 50 %/ 50 % mixture (M). The morphological and structural properties of <b>the</b> obtained <b>sheets</b> were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods. Stress-strain, smoothness and pH measurements were employed to determine the changes in physical-chemical characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> after mixing two types of the fibers and subsequent treatment with Mg(OH) 2. It has been shown that <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> made of <b>the</b> fiber mixture show higher tensile index and smoothness. The modification with Mg(OH) 2 nanoparticles induces an increase in the pH of <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> to slightly basic values (around pH 8), facilitates the inter-fiber bonding and additionally enhances the smoothness of <b>the</b> <b>sheets.</b> Finally, by exposing <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> to <b>the</b> thermo-hygrometric accelerated artificial ageing, {{it was found that the}} physical properties of <b>the</b> treated <b>sheets</b> were not significantly dependent on the environmental factors.

40|$|The current {{distribution}} {{in a parallel}} set of thin conducting sheets due to an external applied source is investigated. All sheets are placed in one plane. The source, and all excited fields, are time harmonic. The frequency is low enough to allow for an electro quasi-static approximation (neglecting the displacement current). <b>The</b> conducting <b>sheets</b> are infinitely long and the current is uniform in the longitudinal direction of <b>the</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sheets</b> have a thin rectangular cross-section, so thin that the current can be assumed uniform in the thickness-direction. Hence, the {{current distribution}} only depends on the transverse coordinate. Due to the mutual induction between <b>the</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>the</b> current dis-tribution over {{the width of the}} cross-section becomes non-uniform: it accumulates at the edges of <b>the</b> <b>sheets.</b> It is especially this so-called edge-effect, and its dependence on the applied frequency and the distances between <b>the</b> <b>sheets,</b> that is <b>the</b> aim of this investiga-tion. From the Maxwell equations, a set of integral equations for the current distribution in <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> is derived. These integral equations are solved, as far as possible by ana-lytical means, by writing the current distribution in each sheet as a series of Legendre polynomials. The general method is worked out for N (N ≥ 1) sheets, but explicit results are presented for N = 1 and N = 3. It turns out that the edge-effect becomes stronger for increasing frequencies. For this solution, only a very restricted number of Legendre polynomials is needed. ...|$|R
