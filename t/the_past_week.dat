5|$|After {{finishing}} Yuka, Haruka, Saki, and Kurumi's routes, {{the player}} gets {{access to the}} Izumi Cure route, in which Makoto learns that Izumi and Okuhiko had deceived him into thinking that his premonitions were true. Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and that the events of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple people believe in a delusion and the delusion is spread to others, the delusion becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E

25|$|On 17 April, OCHA {{reported}} on the increasing deterioration of the humanitarian situation, reporting airstrikes hitting in Saada City a water tank, the electricity station, a petrol station, a plastics processing factory, a shopping centre and a housing complex. Several days earlier, airstrikes had hit private homes, the post office, a community centre, government offices, markets and vehicles. Local partners estimated about 50 dead within <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> In Sana'a residential neighborhoods near Assir, Ayban and Faj Attan were affected due to their proximity to military camps. In Amran, airstrikes hit a petrol station, an educational institute and a bridge. According to local reports, a local water corporation in Hajjah (Abbs District) was hit.

25|$|After {{a humiliating}} shutout loss <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> Cody Pickett {{was given the}} job of {{starting}} quarterback. The game started off with Zeke Moreno intercepting a pass from BC Lions quarterback Buck Pierce. Toronto was leading 9–0, but after Buck Pierce {{was taken out of}} the game as a result of concussion-like symptoms, BC's second-string quarterback Jarious Jackson came in and led the Lions to their first touchdown of the game. The Argos responded by delivering a touchdown pass to Reggie McNeal. Although the Argos had a lot of trouble finding the endzone throughout the game, kicker Justin Medlock helped them keep the lead by kicking field goals. Medlock would score seven field goals, tying Lance Chomyc's Argonauts team record and just short of the league record of eight shared by Dave Ridgway, Mark McLoughlin, and Paul Osbaldiston.|$|E

25|$|On 24 July, YPG-led forces {{advanced}} again, {{crossing the}} highway and capturing the village of Malhah, once again cutting off ISIL's last supply route to Sarrin. Heavy fighting continued around the urban areas of Sarrin. It was reported that the Euphrates Volcano (Burkan Al-Firat) forces had been pounding Sarrin with artillery for <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> and that ISIL shot at civilians who tried to leave the town. On the next day, YPG and FSA forces advanced further southward, capturing the village of Milhah, located {{to the south of}} Malhah, further securing the siege of Sarrin. Later on the same day, in response to the YPG and FSA advances, ISIL attacked YPG fighters on the road between Magharatayn and Malhah, which ran into the southern part of Sarrin, before firing mortar bombs on the area after their initial attack failed.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E

500|$|The College Dropout diverged {{from the}} then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop {{in favor of}} more diverse, topical {{subjects}} for the lyrics. Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, [...] "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, [...] "My persona is that I'm the regular person. Just think about whatever you've been through in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> and I have a song about that on my album." [...] The album was musically notable for West's unique development of his [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] production style, in which R and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.|$|E
500|$|The {{storm is}} unusual in that due to its loop near Cuba, initial reports {{suggested}} that it was actually two separate cyclones. The Monthly Weather Review describes the event as multiple disturbances and reports that the first hurricane dissipated in the central Gulf of Mexico after crossing Cuba, while the second formed subsequently and hit Florida. At the time, the storm's track was subject to much debate. It was later identified as a single storm, although observations on the hurricane led to advances {{in the understanding of}} tropical cyclones with similar paths. On October 19, The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Whether two storms have been raging in Cuban waters within <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> or whether the same storm has revisited Cuba, traversing southern Florida in its backwards course, remains to be determined. If the later supposition be correct, the recurve of the storm, after its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico, must have been unusually sudden and sharp." ...|$|E

500|$|Other {{stories were}} {{developed}} from simple concepts. For example, the reformed-vampire episode [...] "Bloodlust" [...] {{was developed to}} suggest that all monsters should not be killed indiscriminately. The plot alluded to [...] "racial issues", but not blatantly; rather, as Padalecki noted, they explored it in a [...] "fun way". The episode [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] emerged from the writers' desire to keep the audience guessing. Cathryn Humphris pitched a story with a ghost serving as a death omen—warning people of future tragedy, {{rather than trying to}} kill them, unlike previous ghosts on the series. However, Humphris had trouble developing the script's outline. Kripke noted a part of the episode in which brothers are arrested and have to explain to police what had happened; this scenario ultimately became the framework of the episode, which begins with Sam and Dean being taken into custody. The concept for [...] "Tall Tales" [...] originated as a [...] "he said, he said" [...] episode, in which the brothers would recount conflicting versions of the same storyline. The writers deliberated over the use of five or six monsters in trying to find one appropriate for the episode, but eventually settled on a trickster because it [...] "can do everything [...] want it to". Although the writers typically prefer to put their own spin on folklore, they decided in this case to remain faithful to the archetypal trickster mythos. Because the season alluded to the possibility of Sam becoming bad, the writers wanted to portray how an evil Sam would behave and what Dean's reaction would be. One of the writers' first creative ideas of the season was depicted in the teaser of [...] "Born Under a Bad Sign", in which a blood-covered Sam wakes up not remembering <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> of his life. The plot, which [...] "fell into place" [...] during the writing process, included demonic possession to explain Sam's actions—an event that resulted in the return of the vengeful Meg Masters demon.|$|E
