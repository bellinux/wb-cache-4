The usefulness of the interface for impurity profiling of steriods has been demonstrated by the analysis of two samples of testosterone undecanoate. Valuable structural information on impurities >= 5 % was obtained either by library searching of the produced FTIR spectra, or by interpretation. Identification of two of the impurities, testosterone enanthate and <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate,</b> was hampered by the fact that both compounds may occur in a crystalline and in an amorphous state.

We established four experimental groups: sedentary control, sedentary treated, trained control and trained treated. The training had consisted of running on a treadmill for nine weeks. Treated animals received intramuscular injections of nandrolone decanoate (0. 5 mg kg- 1) during the last four weeks of physical training.

The aim of this thesis was to develop a rapid, selective, effective and simple method of high performance liquid chromatography suitable for the determination of anabolic steroids in injectable dosage form. The analyzed sample of pharmaceutical product Sustamed contained four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone isocaproate and <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate.</b> Optimized HPLC-DAD conditions suitable for determination of the selected testosterone esters were as follows: core-shell column Poroshell HPH-C 18 (3. 0 x 100 mm, 2. 7 mm), mobile phase consisted of 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate, pH 4. 5 and acetonitrile, gradient elution was used.

40|$|Sustanon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, testosterone isocaproate and <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate.</b> Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that Sustanon can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|E
40|$|Hormone and {{veterinary}} drug screening and forensics {{can benefit from}} the recent developments in desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry (MS). In this work the feasibility of DESI application for the rapid screening of intact esters of anabolic steroids in bovine hair has been studied. Using a linear ion trap both full scan and data-dependent collision induced dissociation MSn spectra were acquired in minutes for testosterone cypionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> and estradiol benzoate standard solutions deposited on a glass or PTFE surface. However direct analysis of incurred hair failed due to inefficient desorption ionization and the minute quantities of steroid esters present. Therefore a simplified ultrasonic liquid extraction procedure was developed, allowing rapid DESI analysis of a few microliters of the concentrate and a total analysis time of 2 – 4 h per batch instead of 3 days. The potential of this DESI approach is clearly demonstrated by MS 3 data from hair samples incurred with high levels (300 – 800 µg kg- 1) of steroid esters, levels which do occur in samples from controlled- and illegally treated animals. For much lower levels state-of-the-art ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) screening methods remain the method of choice and might benefit from the proposed simplified extraction as well...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} the applicability of a yeast androgen and estrogen bioassay in the detection of steroid esters in hair samples of animals treated with a hormone ester cocktail. The outcome of the activity screenings was critically compared with the results previously obtained with LC-MS/MS analysis. Hair samples of one pour-on treated animal, 10 ml DMSO containing 25 mg estradiol benzoate (EB), 60 mg <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> (TD) and 60 mg testosterone cypionate (TC), were selected and analyzed with the androgen and estrogen yeast bioassay. Results showed that by the introduction of a hydrolysis step, bioassays can be used to screen for the presence of hormone esters in hair samples. Based on the difference in fluorescence responses between the nonhydrolyzed and the hydrolyzed hair samples, it was possible to detect the presence of EB up to at least 56 days after a single pour-on treatment and to detect the presence of TC and TD up to at least 14 days after the treatment. Although the LC-MS/MS analysis could detect TC and TD up to 49 days after treatment, bioassays have the advantage that they can also detect any (un) known steroid ester. Keywords Testosterone ester.

40|$|In t 974, steroids {{were added}} to the list of doping agents banned by the International Olympic Committee because of their effects on the {{performance}} of the athletes. Testosterone and its esters promote the development of secondary male sexual characteristics and accelerate muscle growth. The mandatory test to detect testosterone abuse is to measure the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone in the urine. However, because athletes can adjust their dosage to stay within the range permitted, there is a risk of test evasion. Therefore, we developed two original procedures to determine testosterone and its esters in human hair. First, testosterone was investigated in hair obtained from 26 control subjects. After decontamination with dichloromethane, 100 mg of hair was incubated in 1 M NaOH in the presence of 1 ng of testosterone-d 3. After neutralization, the extract was purified using solid-phase xtraction with Isolute Ct 8 columns followed by liquid-liquid extraction with pentane. After silylation, testosterone was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentrations were in the range 1. 2 to 11. 4 pg/mg with a mean value of 3. 8 pg/mg. To distinguish exogenous abuse from endogenous levels, the incorporation of testosterone esters into hair was investigated. Preparation i volved methanolic incubation to avoid the cleavage of the esters. In a panel of eight esters, it was possible to identify testosterone propionate, testosterone enanthate, and <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> in the hair of two bodybuUders and one weight lifter.

40|$|Receptor binding {{transcription}} activation bioassays {{are valuable}} tools for the screening of steroid hormones in animal feed and supplements. However, steroid derivatives often lack affinity for their cognate receptor {{and do not}} show any direct hormonal activity by themselves. These compounds are thus not detected by these kinds of bioassays and need a bioactivation step {{in order to become}} active, both in vivo and in vitro. In this study a comparison was made between different in vitro activation methods for hormone esters and hormone glycosides. Testosterone acetate and <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> were chosen as model compounds for the hormone esters, representing the broad range of steroid esters of varying polarities, while genistin was used as a substitute model for the steroid-glycosides. Concerning bioactivation of the steroids esters, the efficiency for alkaline hydrolysis was 90 – 100 % and much better as compared to enzymatic deconjugation by esterase. As a result 1 µg testosterone ester per gram of animal feed could easily be detected by a yeast androgen bioassay. When comparing different enzyme fractions for deglycosilation, genistin was shown to be deconjugated most efficiently by ß-glucuronidase/aryl sulfatase from Helix pomatia, resulting in a significant increase of estrogenic activity as determined by a yeast estrogen bioassay. In conclusion, chemical and enzymatic deconjugation procedures for ester and glycoside conjugates respectively, resulted in a significant increase in hormonal activity as shown by the bioassay readouts and allowed effective screening of these derivatives in animal feed and feed supplements...|$|E
40|$|The {{abuse of}} {{synthetic}} esters of natural steroids such as testosterone and estradiol in cattle fattening and sports {{is hard to}} detect via routine urine testing. The esters are rapidly hydrolysed in vivo into substances which are also endogenously present in urine. An interesting alternative can be provided by {{the analysis of the}} administered synthetic steroids themselves, i. e., the analysis of intact steroid esters in hair by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). However, retrospective estimation of the application date following a non-compliant finding is hindered by the complexity of the kinetics of the incorporation of steroid esters in hair. In this study, the incorporation of intact steroid esters in hair following pour-on treatment has been studied and critically compared with results from intramuscular treatment. To this end animals were pour-on treated with a hormone cocktail containing testosterone cypionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> and estradiol benzoate in different carriers. The animals were either treated using injection and pour-on application once or three times having 1  week between treatments using injection and pour-on application. Animals were slaughtered from 10 – 12  weeks after the last treatment. Both hair and blood plasma samples were collected and analysed by LC/MS/MS. From the results, it is concluded that after single treatment the levels of steroid esters in hair drop to CCβ levels (5 – 20  µg/kg) after 5 – 7  weeks. When treatment is repeated two times, the CCβ levels are reached after 9 – 11  weeks. Furthermore, in plasma, no steroid esters were detected; not even at the low microgramme per litre level but—in contrast with the pour-on application—after i. m. injection, significant increase of 17 β-testosterone and 17 β-estradiol were observed. These observations suggest that transport of steroid esters after pour-on application is not only performed by blood but also by alternative fluids in the animal so probably the steroid esters are already hydrolysed and epimerized before entering the blood...|$|E
40|$|Depriving hormone-dependent {{breast cancer}} cells of estrogens {{has been shown}} to be a {{beneficial}} strategy in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens include: 17 [beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 [beta]-HSD), aromatase (AR) and estrone sulfatase (ES). The latter two have been the target of intensive research within our group. Within the current project, we report the synthesis of various types of compounds as potential inhibitors of AR in an effort to determine detailed information regarding the active site of this enzyme; we have also attempted to combine our knowledge of AR and ES in the development of compounds which are able to ihhibit both enzymes. In the first series of compounds to be investigated, compounds were synthesised based on enantiomerically pure forms of the "Evans chiral auxiliary", which is commercially available in both the R and S forms. The oxazolidinone and the phenyl ring systems were derivatised so as to produce N-alkylated compounds which contained a phenylamine moiety for ligating to the Fe of the cytochrome P- 450 haem. The compounds were evaluated using a standard literature assay and were, in general, found to be equipotent or more potent than the standard compound aminoglutethimide (AG), with the most potent inhibitor being the pentyi derivative of the R-form (IC 50 = 0. B 3 ±O. 05 ¡ [...] tM). An interesting and different trend was observed 'within the inhibitors based on the S-enantiomer, which were found to be weak inhibitors of AR in comparison to AG - the most potent compound (55) was found to possess an IC 50 value of 16. 82 ± 0. 20 ¡ [...] tM. The inhibitory activities of both the R- and S-forms were rationalised using the novel substrate-haem complex (SHC) approach. 'From the rationalisation of the inhibitory activity of the oxazolidinone based compounds, the importance of the C(17) position of the steroid backbone was highlighted. As such, we undertook the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of a series of esters based on testosterone. On undertaking the biochemical evaluation of these compounds it was discovered that testosterone possessed potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 20. 6 ±O. 15 ¡ [...] tM), and that of the esters, testosterone acetate was shown to have an IC 50 value of 4 B. 7 ±O. 07 ¡ [...] tM, whereas <b>testosterone</b> <b>decanoate</b> possessed an IC 50 value of 164. 1 ±O. 5 ¡ [...] tM. However, the derivatisatian of the alkyl to an aryl carboxylate moiety resulted in one compound which was found to possess highly potent inhibitory activity. That is, testosterone 4 -nitrobenzoate was found to possess an IC 50 value of B. 5 ± 0. 05 ¡ [...] tM. In an effort to synthesise dual inhibitors of AR and ES, we undertook the synthesis of compounds based on the results of our previous studies into ES and the inhibitory activities observed within the testosterone and oxazolidinone based compounds. 'In particular, an attempt was made to incorporate the structural aspects of anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) together with a sulfonated phenyl moiety. We synthesised a series of azole based compounds and as expected, these compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of AR, the most potent [1 -(4 -chloro-benzyl) - 1 H-imidazole (BO) ] was found to possess an IC 50 value of 70 ± 0. 5 nM. However, the synthesis of the sulfonated compounds proved troublesome and as such no inhibitory data was obtained for these compounds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
