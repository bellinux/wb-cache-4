5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts {{to make light of}} the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the need <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg.

5|$|With a {{strengthening}} of the defence, City's form improved further the next season, in 1913–14, coming fourth, two points outside the promotion places. Despite having failed on his promise to get the team promoted within two years, City's rising attendances and resulting better profits for the club kept the directors happy, and the club were confident of promotion in 1914–15. However, the declaration of World War I disrupted Leeds City's season, with attendances down as men signed up to fight. Chapman by now had amassed a very large squad and was unable <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> consistent side, continually changing his first-choice lineup. Leeds City lost six of their last eight {{games of the season}} to finish just fifteenth.|$|E
5|$|Kamara's main {{selection}} dilemma was in attack {{where he}} had <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> strike partner for Stallard, a player who had joined from Derby County in January for £120,000 and gone on to score ten goals. Kamara opted for Shutt, who was given only a 50 per cent of playing {{in the run-up to}} the match because of a slight knock, with Ian Ormondroyd, a veteran of three play-off finals with his previous club Leicester City, selected as substitute. Captain Eddie Youds, who overcame a knee problem to return to the side in defence in place of David Brightwell, was the only player not to have played in the second leg against Blackpool. Notts County's side featured only two of the players that had been relegated the previous season – Tony Agana and Shaun Murphy. Their side also contained Darren Ward, who was selected for the Second Division PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) representative side, and Steve Finnan, on loan from First Division Birmingham City.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

5|$|Ralph Klein, {{the former}} mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, {{promising}} a new era of debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with a slim majority. Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>a</b> retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E
