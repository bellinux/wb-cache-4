25|$|In the 1990s, Emirates {{launched}} its {{first set of}} commercials with the slogan So be good <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> Fly Emirates. In 1999, they launched a very rare A330-200 launch commercial with different pictures showing their aircraft with the original logo and the current logo (which was launched a few months before).|$|E

25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E
25|$|I {{might put}} it this way. The story is cast {{in terms of a}} good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E
500|$|To {{show the}} abundance, the dance-like aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me <b>to</b> <b>Yourself</b> as Your own), is {{accompanied}} by all the wind instruments, playing concertante and together. Instead of a conventional da capo aria, Bach creates a bar form by repeating {{the text of the}} second idea on new musical material. A long ritornello of 32 measures [...] "contains an almost unprecedented variety of instrumental colouring", as Mincham writes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you swear}} by Moloch and Astarte {{to be true}} to this society, <b>to</b> devote <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> the {{destruction}} of the oppressors of Carthage, to carry out all measures which may be determined upon, even at the certain risk of your life, and <b>to</b> suffer <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> be torn to pieces by the torture rather than reveal aught that passes within these walls?" ...|$|R

500|$|... "B" [...] argues with [...] "A". He says ethics are the highest. [...] "A" [...] {{wants to}} remain a mystery to himself but [...] "B" [...] says it's {{the meaning of life}} to become open <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b> It's more {{important}} to know yourself than historical persons. The more you know about yourself the more you can find your eternal validity. God will bless the most ethical person. Each one knows what's best for the other but neither knows what's best for himself.|$|E
500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You owe it <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to {{actually}} change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E
500|$|When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He {{had just}} {{finished}} a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, {{and it is clear}} from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: [...] "I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{fidelity}} in marriage, Friedman {{is quoted}} stating [...] "If you help <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> {{the benefits of}} being married when you are single, you're likely <b>to</b> help <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> the benefits of being single when you're married." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him long. [...] "Your attitude, my dear, is that you're afraid of <b>yourself.</b> You've had <b>to</b> take <b>yourself</b> in hand. You've had <b>to</b> do <b>yourself</b> violence." ...|$|R

500|$|Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is [...] "to shew you [...] <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> {{stripped}} of the gorgeous drapery {{in which you}} have enwrapped your tyrannic principles." [...] However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system. As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, [...] "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{with close}} friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding {{this and that}} and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'... I believe you should keep your {{troubles}} <b>to</b> <b>yourself.</b> That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way. When told that most Americans, even {{at the end of his}} career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, [...] "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and Portman first {{discussed}} a ballet film in 2000, {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream, though the script had not yet been written. He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
50|$|Lipman {{authored}} a {{book about}} security entitled How <b>To</b> Protect <b>Yourself</b> From Crime: Everything You Need To Know <b>To</b> Guard <b>Yourself,</b> Your Family, Your Home, Your Possessions, And Your Business in 1975.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'm wrong, Fanny, {{to speak}} to you on other {{subjects}} so soon after the sad event of which we heard last night; but, on the whole, I think it better to do so. It is good for you <b>to</b> rouse <b>yourself,</b> <b>to</b> exert <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> think of other things; besides it will be a comfort to you to know that I have already done, what I am sure you strongly wished to have executed at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm much {{obliged to}} you. But you are <b>to</b> put <b>yourself</b> in {{opposition}} <b>to</b> the greatest movement made {{on behalf of}} the human race for centuries; you are <b>to</b> set <b>yourself</b> up against--" ...|$|R
500|$|The tenor aria [...] "" [...] (Christian children, rejoice!) is {{accompanied}} by both horns and oboes and stresses the words [...] "" [...] (be glad) by extended coloraturas and [...] "" [...] (terrify) by sudden rests. It reflects the joyful mood of the opening chorus. The cantata is closed by [...] "" [...] (Jesu, take <b>to</b> <b>Yourself</b> Your members), the third four-part chorale, asking Jesus for further support in the new year. For several passages, the bass line is moving to illustrate joy and bliss. The harmonisation begins in F minor, changes several times according to the words and reaches F major on the final word [...] "" [...] (Sun of mercy).|$|E
500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku {{praised the}} game, writing, [...] "if {{you own a}} PC, you owe it <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> to play Gravity Bone." [...] He said the game was [...] "one of the coolest things I've played on PC lately." [...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun {{considered}} Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating {{that it is the}} [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." [...] It received the [...] "Best Arthouse Game" [...] award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{speak in}} conundrums," [...] said Morley; [...] "I wish I could guess them. Try <b>to</b> adapt <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> my {{somewhat}} simple capacity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've treated {{more serious}} cases, and you'll get over it. But you'll have <b>to</b> {{reconcile}} <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> lying {{quiet for a}} long while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not {{to carry}} arms, Walter, or <b>to</b> mix <b>yourself</b> up in any way with it. You will {{be a sort of}} camp follower, you know; but you will see all that goes on, and will be able <b>to</b> prepare <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> take your place in the ranks, if the war should, unhappily, go on for any time." ...|$|R
500|$|Bastion was {{released}} to strong sales and critical acclaim. The game {{sold more than}} 500,000 copies during 2011, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention, Bastion's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1.7 million copies combined across all platforms. By May 2014, the game had sold over 2 million copies, and by January 2015, it had sold over 3 million. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it [...] "the perfect mesh of game and story", and McKinley Noble of GamePro said that it [...] "raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot called it [...] "wonderfully crafted" [...] and [...] "an amazingly good time", and Greg Miller of IGN concluded that Bastion [...] "is amazing and you owe it <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> to download it".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the success}} of [...] "Day 'n' Nite", the rapper had {{said that he would}} never try to mix {{politics}} or jocular things in with his lyrical content. After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi had a message in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not actually say or use in real life, adding that being true <b>to</b> <b>yourself</b> entirely was meaningful to him. [...] "I don't speak like a fucking nerdy guy; I speak like a regular dude", he remarked.|$|E
500|$|Marley {{considered}} cannabis {{a healing}} herb, a [...] "sacrament", and an [...] "aid to medication"; {{he supported the}} legalisation of the drug. He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as [...] as showing approval of its usage. Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from Catholicism in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis, but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, [...] "When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself to you. All the wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself <b>to</b> <b>yourself,</b> your conscience, show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate. Is only a natural t'ing and it grow like a tree." [...] Marley saw marijuana usage as a vital factor in religious growth and connection with Jah, and {{as a way to}} philosophise and become wiser.|$|E
