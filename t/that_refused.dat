5|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial. A Starbucks store that opened in 2000 sparked objections and eventually closed on 13 July 2007.

5|$|By most accounts, Ollie Mae Sanders abused Betty Sanders, {{whom she}} was raising in Detroit. When Betty was about 11 years old, she was taken in by Lorenzo and Helen Malloy, a {{prominent}} businessman and his wife.

During one photo session, Cormier lifted a telephone pole from the ground and carried it around while posing for pictures.

5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states <b>that</b> <b>refused</b> to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) <b>that</b> <b>refused</b> to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Momchil was {{approached}} by agents of Kantakouzenos' opponents, the Constantinopolitan regency, and persuaded to turn against him. Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were far away in eastern Thrace, he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near Portolagos and sank three of them. He then overcame another Turkish force that arrived to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion (also known as Burugrad), and plundered several cities in the area <b>that</b> <b>refused</b> to surrender. Afterwards, Momchil along with 1,000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos, who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him. The Byzantines were thoroughly routed: Kantakouzenos' horse was killed and he received a powerful hit to the head, which he survived thanks to his helmet. Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos' men, but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company <b>that</b> <b>refused</b> his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
5|$|Crispi’s good {{intentions}} {{got lost in}} the outcry for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries <b>that</b> <b>refused</b> to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished. Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally that asked for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia.

Neither of them explain why such duress would cause a truthful answer to be more consistent with the categorical imperative than refusing to answer. Subsequent commentators on the challenge often point out that there is likely no such reason.|$|R
