There are three main heat loads in the tanks of which two can be controlled to a certain extent through operational considerations. These two are mixing pump heat and heat of chemical addition. The third heat source is radionuclide content which can only be controlled by what wastes are pumped to the tank and whether it is diluted prior to pumping.

This work focuses on initial mixing within a direct filtration treatment scheme, {{in order to gain}} some insight into the nature of the mixing process. A direct filtration pilot plant incorporating a variable speed, baffled <b>tank</b> <b>mixer</b> was operated with various mixing intensities during the investigation. Filtrate quality and filter head-loss data from the pilot plant were used to establish the effectiveness of a given mixing condition. Also, mixing within a hydraulic jump was similarly investigated in order to compare hydraulic mixing to mechanical (stirred baffled tank or backmix reactor) mixing. An idealized mixing model, which was based on the interaction of the coagulant carrying turbulent microscales with colloid particles, was proposed. The results of the pilot plant studies indicate that a colloid-microscale size correlation similar to the correlation proposed by the mixing model may exist. Also, a method_was proposed for calculating the mean velocity gradient (G-value) of a hydraulic jump occurring on a sloping channel. The usefulness of this calculation method was confirmed in this study. Finally, the pilot plant data collected during this investigation indicated that the hydraulic jump was comparable to the baffled tank for initial rapid mixing (based on similar velocity gradients).

40|$|The {{capability}} to vent in zero gravity without resettling is a technology need that involves practically all uses of sub-critical cryogenics in space, and would extend cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle capabilities. However, {{the lack of}} definition regarding liquid/ullage orientation coupled with the somewhat random nature of the thermal stratification and resulting pressure rise rates, lead to significant technical challenges. Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a <b>tank</b> <b>mixer</b> to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule-Thomson (J-T) valve to extract thermal energy from the propellant. Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) {{was used to test}} both spray-bar and axial jet TVS concepts. The axial jet system consists of a recirculation pump heat exchanger unit. The spray-bar system consists of a recirculation pump, a parallel flow concentric tube heat exchanger, and a spray-bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. The operation of both concepts is similar. In the mixing mode, the recirculation pump withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the heat exchanger, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to vent in zero gravity without resettling {{is a fundamental}} technology need that involves practically all uses of subcritical cryogenics in space. Venting without resettling would extend cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle capabilities. However, the lack of definition regarding liquid/ullage orientation coupled with the somewhat random nature of the thermal stratification and resulting pressure rise rates, lead to significant technical challenges. Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a <b>tank</b> <b>mixer</b> to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule- Thomson (J-T) valve to extract then-nal energy from the propellant. In a cooperative effort, Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (N 4 HTB) {{was used to test}} a unique "spray bar" TVS system developed by Boeing. A schematic of this system is included in Figure 1. The system consists of a recirculation pump, a parallel flow concentric tube, heat exchanger, and a spray bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. In the mixing mode, the recirculation pump withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it radially into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the spray bar heat exchanger element, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. Figure 2 is a plot of ullage pressure (P 4) and liquid vapor pressure (PSAI) versus time. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses. The primary advantage of the spray bar configuration is that pressure reduction is achieved independent of liquid and vapor location, thereby enhancing the applicability of normal gravity test data to zero gravity conditions. The in-tank components are minimized with the proposed TVS design. Because the recirculation pump is external to the tank, no electrical power penetration of the tank is required for pump or valve operation. This is especially desirable for L 02 tanks since the presence of an electrical ignition source in oxygen represents a critical failure mode. Also, since the critical components (pump, motor, valve, orifice) are external to the tank, system checkout and ground servicing/replacement are easier. For zero-g operation, component replacement external to the tank may be a significant benefit. In addition to satisfying the zero g TVS design objectives, the TVS concept tested offers additional benefits to the integrated subcritical cryogenic storage and launch system...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} kinetics of surfactants at the solid [...] liquid interface is of fundamental interest {{to a wide}} variety of process including detergency, wetting of solid surfaces, agricultural sprays and paper processing. Accordingly, a significant body of work has been carried out to understand this field. Much of this work has used the optical techniques of ellipsometry and optical reflectometry or mass measurements from the quartz crystal microbalance. These methods have the time resolution to measure surfactant {{adsorption kinetics}} but are insensitive to chemical composition and thus produce limited information on the adsorption of surfactant mixtures. The technique I adopt here, total internal reflection (TIR) Raman spectroscopy, provides detailed information about the chemical composition of the surface with a time resolution of 2 s. The short penetration depth of the probe laser into solution (∼ 100 nm) provides surface sensitivity. The different components of the adsorbed film are distinguished by their vibrational Raman spectra. The Raman signal from a component in the adsorbed layer is linearly proportional to the amount of that component present, allowing straightforward interpretation of the acquired data. I use principal component analysis to deconvolute the recorded spectra. First I look at the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the adsorption of two model surfactants to a flat silica surface as single component systems: the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the non-ionic surfactant Triton X- 100. Use of the well-defined wall jet geometry provides known hydrodynamics allowing the mass transport to the surface to be modelled. The mass transport model is coupled with a kinetic model consistent with the Frumkin isotherm allowing the whole adsorption process to be captured. The fit between the model and the experimental results helps to understand interactions on the surface. Secondly I look at the two model surfactants adsorbing to silica as a mixed system. The adsorption isotherm shows strong synergistic behaviour with the addition of small amounts of CTAB (∼ 2 % of the 2 mM total surfactant concentration) doubling the adsorbed amount of Triton X- 100. This synergism has a marked influence on the kinetics: for example, when Triton X- 100 replaces CTAB the Triton X- 100 surface excess overshoots its equilibrium value and returns only very slowly to equilibrium. For systems above the cmc, the repartitioning of surfactant between micelles and monomers results a local increase in the monomer concentration of Triton X- 100 resulting in a temporary spike in the Triton X- 100 surface excess during the rinsing of a mixed layer. Finally I study alternative model surfaces to silica. The adsorption to CTAB and Triton X- 100 to a cellulose surface is studied, and detailed equilibrium isotherms obtained by slow variation of the bulk concentration controlled with a continuous stirred <b>tank</b> <b>mixer.</b> The preparation of the model cellulose surface is also followed spectroscopically. Spectra are also acquired from mica surfaces in optical contact with silica hemispheres; it is unfortunately not yet possible to acquire useful data on adsorption at the mica [...] water interface.

Here, a high temperature solar cooling system is coupled with a conventional combined cycle, in order to pre-cool gas turbine inlet air {{in order to enhance}} system efficiency and electrical capacity. In this paper, the system is analyzed from an exergetic point of view, on the basis of an energy-economic model presented in a recent work, where the obtained main results show that SACC exhibits a higher electrical production and efficiency with respect to the conventional CC. The system performance is evaluated by a dynamic simulation, where detailed simulation models are implemented for all the components included in the system. In addition, for all the components and for the system as whole, energy and exergy balances are implemented in order to calculate the magnitude of the irreversibilities within the system. In fact, exergy analysis is used in order to assess: exergy destructions and exergetic efficiencies. Such parameters are used in order to evaluate the magnitude of the irreversibilities in the system and to identify the sources of such irreversibilities. Exergetic efficiencies and exergy destructions are dynamically calculated for the 1 -year operation of the system. Similarly, exergetic results are also integrated on weekly and yearly bases in order to evaluate the corresponding irreversibilities.

Side-effects that might reduce the applicability of this technology, are gas production at both electrodes (and especially at the negative one) and significant corrosion at the positive electrode due to electrochemical reactions at metal surfaces.

5000|$|In a batch high-shear mixer, the {{components}} to be mixed (whether immiscible liquids or powder in liquid) are fed {{from the top}} into a mixing <b>tank</b> containing the <b>mixer</b> on a rotating shaft {{at the bottom of}} the tank. A batch high-shear mixer can process a given volume of material approximately twice as fast as an inline rotor-stator mixer of the same power rating; such mixers continue to be used where faster processing by volume is the major requirement, and space is not limited. [...] When mixing sticky solutions, some of the product may be left in the tank, necessitating cleaning. However, there are designs of batch high-shear mixers that clean the tank as part of the operating run. Some high-shear mixers are designed to run dry, limiting the amount of cleaning needed in the tank.|$|R
40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{performed}} mixer tests using 3 -kW (4 -hp) Flygt mixers in 1. 8 - and 5. 7 -m-diameter tanks at the 336 building {{facility in}} Richland, Washington to evaluate candidate scaling relationships for Flygt mixers used for sludge mobilization and particle suspension. These tests constituted {{the second phase}} of a three-phase test program involving representatives from ITT Flygt Corporation, the Savannah River Site (SRS), the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and PNNL. The results of the first phase of tests, which were conducted at ITT Flygt's facility in a 0. 45 -m-diameter tank, are documented in Powell et al. (1999). Although some of the Phase B tests were geometrically similar to selected Phase A tests (0. 45 -m tank), none of the Phase B tests were geometrically, cinematically, and/or dynamically similar to the planned Tank 19 mixing system. Therefore, the mixing observed during the Phase B tests is not directly indicative of the mixing expected in Tank 19 and some extrapolation of the data is required to make predictions for Tank 19 mixing. Of particular concern is the size of the mixer propellers used for the 5. 7 -m tank tests. These propellers were more than three times larger than required by geometric scaling of the <b>Tank</b> 19 <b>mixers.</b> The implications of the lack of geometric similarity, as well as other factors that complicate interpretation of the test results, are discussed in Section 5. 4...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{simulation}} {{model of a}} novel solar heating and cooling system based on innovative high temperature flat plate evacuated solar thermal collector is presented. The system configuration includes: flat-plate evacuated solar collectors, a double-stage LiBr-H 2 O absorption chiller, gas-fired auxiliary heater, a closed loop cooling tower, pumps, heat exchangers, storage <b>tanks,</b> valves, <b>mixers</b> and controllers. The novelty of this study lies in the utilization of flat-plate stationary solar collectors, manufactured by TVP Solar, rather than concentrating ones (typically adopted for driving double-stage absorption chillers). Such devices show ultra-high thermal efficiencies, even at very high (about 200 °C) operating temperatures, thanks to the high vacuum insulation. Aim of the paper is to analyse the energy and economic feasibility of such novel technology, by including it in a prototypal solar heating and cooling system. For this purpose, the solar heating and cooling system design and performance were analysed {{by means of a}} purposely developed dynamic simulation model, implemented in TRNSYS. A suitable case study is also presented. Here, the simulated plant is conceived for the space heating and cooling and the domestic hot water production of a small building, whose energy needs are fulfilled through a real installation (settled also for experimental purposes) built up close to Naples (South Italy). Simulation results show that the investigated system is able to reach high thermal efficiencies and very good energy performance. Finally, the economic analysis shows results comparable to those achieved through similar renewable energy systems...|$|R
40|$|A Flocculation {{system for}} water {{treatment}} facilities comprises of a flocculation tank having {{a plurality of}} baffle which divide {{the interior of the}} flocculation tank into a plurality of components. The baffle are arranged to provide inter compartmental openings between adjacent upstream and downstream compartment, which in turn are arranged to provide a serpentine flow path through the flocculation <b>tank.</b> A mechanical <b>mixer</b> is mounted in each compartment for supplementing the mixing energy provided by the serpentine flow, particularly during period of low water flow rates. The aim of this research work is to construct a model of a flocculation tank capable of contributing in the water treatment process to provide domestic water supply for NDA permanent site. The objective of construction of coagulation /flocculation chamber is to produce a settled water of low turbidity which in turn will allow reasonably long filter run using suitable coagulants type and required amount or dosage and achieving an effective floc formation...|$|R
