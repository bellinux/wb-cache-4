5|$|Baird defended another Conservative {{government}} decision to cut funds for climate science research, arguing that further studies are largely superfluous {{in light of}} recent United Nations reports. Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed, claiming that further research is the best way <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> changing climate.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, {{as well as in}} abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E

5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before {{the opening of the}} season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker George A. Romero {{was brought}} in with {{a vision of a}} zombie-style horror movie similar to Night of the Living Dead, but which also relied heavily upon {{elements}} of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens {{as a result of his}} preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.|$|E

In response to the problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries' policies on world trade GATT could not manage etc.), the eighth GATT round – known as the Uruguay Round – was launched in September 1986, in Punta del Este, Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{the process}} of gene {{transcription}} affects patterns of gene expression and, thereby, allows a cell <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival.

In Escherichia coli bacteria, more than 100 transcription factors have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.|$|E
25|$|High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI) {{is a high}} {{dynamic range}} (HDR) {{technique}} used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity than is possible with standard digital imaging or photographic techniques. The aim is to present a similar range of luminance to that experienced through the human visual system. The human eye, through adaptation of the iris and other methods, adjusts constantly <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see {{in a wide range}} of light conditions.|$|E
50|$|Island {{species are}} often very inbred, as their {{isolation}} from the larger group on a mainland allows natural selection {{to work on their}} population. This type of isolation may result in the formation of race or even speciation, as the inbreeding first removes many deleterious genes, and permits the expression of genes that allow <b>a</b> population <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ecosystem. As the adaptation becomes more pronounced, the new species or race radiates from its entrance into the new space, or dies out if it cannot adapt and, most importantly, reproduce.|$|R

25|$|If {{effective}} protection {{were implemented}} immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this {{would create a}} bigger population of genetically impoverished bongos. These animals would be less able <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason, the 'metapopulation management plan' must occur concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance in situ population growth. This initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{is important}} because it allows an individual <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> changing environment and can ultimately alter their evolutionary path. It not only plays an indirect role in defense as individuals prepare themselves physically to take on the task of avoiding predation through camouflage or developing collective mechanical traits to protect a social hive, but also a direct one. For example, cues elicited from a predator, which may be visual, acoustic, chemical, or vibrational, may cause rapid responses that alter the prey’s phenotype in real time.|$|E
25|$|Most ethologists {{believe that}} {{aggression}} confers biological advantages. Aggression may help an animal secure territory, including {{resources such as}} food and water. Aggression between males often occurs to secure mating opportunities, and results in selection of the healthier/more vigorous animal. Aggression may also occur for self-protection or to protect offspring. Aggression between groups of animals may also confer advantage; for example, hostile behavior may force a population of animals into a new territory, where the need <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new environment may {{lead to an increase}} in genetic flexibility.|$|E

Correspondingly, the infrastructure in a software radio system is generally required to use reconfigurable VLSI hardware components such as DSP chip sets [12], FPGAs [13], embedded processors [14], and even general purpose processors [15].|$|R
25|$|The {{bull shark}} is diadromous, meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease. These fish also are {{euryhaline}} fish, able <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range of}} salinities. The bull shark {{is one of the}} few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems. Many of the euryhaline fish are bony fish such as salmon and tilapia and are not closely related to bull sharks. Evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect, one being that the bull shark encountered a population bottleneck that occurred during the last ice age. This bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the Elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system.|$|E
25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way}} as thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} {{in the region and}} in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time led to Clement Attlee appointing him Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948.
