40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and testing of}} a seven shank, three point ripper built for de Graaf Ranch. This ripper will replace older equipment that was not built to withstand the horsepower developed by more modern tractors that are used by de Graaf Ranch. This tillage device is designed to meet ASABE standards for horsepower requirements of farm equipment. This implement incorporates a shear pin design that will protect the frame from damage {{in the event that}} the ripper encounters a subsoil obstacle that would significantly damage the equipment. The shank was designed to reduce the disturbance of the topsoil while causing more disturbance in the subsoil, thus reducing the need for post <b>till</b> <b>operations,</b> increasing efficiency, and helping to preserve the environment. Testing of the ripper on eight hundred plus acres of various types of soil confirms that the shank design is an improvement from older designs by reducing the topsoil disturbance.

40|$|Sources of {{regional}} particulate matter (PM), particularly agricultural operations, {{must be understood}} in order to manage the air quality in irrigated dry climates. Direct monitoring measurements alone are useful, but not sufficient, to estimate regional PM source concentrations. This paper combines modeling with ground (point) and airplane (spatial) measurement methods to estimate regional PM 10 (PM diameter <= 10 mu m) contributions from agricultural operations. Hourly data from three {{air quality monitoring stations}} positioned at a 2 -m height located on the west and east mesas of New Mexico's Mesilla Valley and in the valley at Anthony, NM were acquired from the New Mexico Air Quality Bureau. The study spanned the agricultural tilling season, March 1 to April 30, for the years 2008 to 2012. One-second spatial PM 10 concentrations at 200 m above the valley floor were measured during a two-hour controlled field <b>tilling</b> <b>operation</b> on April 1, 2008. The HYSPLIT 4. 0 (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory version 4) model was run at the corresponding times and heights, outputting PM 10 concentrations from all potential agricultural <b>tilling</b> <b>operations.</b> The calculated percentage contribution (modeled PM 10 concentration/measured PM 10 concentration) indicated that the near-surface (2 -m height) proportion from the agricultural operations for five seasonal averages ranged from 0. 7 % to 1. 5 % on the west and east mesas and 1. 3 % for the valley site at Anthony. There were 71 hourly high values of contribution ratios ranging from 30 to 100 % at the three sites, depending on the wind speed and direction...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a guidance-assistance system for agricultural vehicles in land preparation and <b>tilling</b> <b>operations.</b> The proposed system is a potential replacement for markers on the implement toolbar. The new automatic steering system controls the vehicle path based on the trace of the previous <b>tilling</b> <b>operation</b> on the field. Hough transform method was adapted to process forward view images of the tractor captured by a digital camera. For traces coinciding with center line of the images no correction is necessary, otherwise the relative position of the trace with respect to image center line would be an indication of the need for steering wheel adjustment. The proposed system was evaluated at various conditions including three illumination levels, previous plant residue levels (9, 24 and 50 %) and soil surfaces tilled by one of the three implements (plow, subsoiler and row-crop plant furrow opener). For each test accuracy of algorithm was determined and Line Prediction Error (LPE) was calculated by the algorithm. Tests were conducted in field at three forward speeds; 4, 7. 5 and 11 km h - 1 and three steering angles; 10 o, 16 o and 20. 5 o. Distance error (DE) and response time (RT) for each forward speed and steering angle was measured and compared. Results indicated that various illumination and residue levels have not distorted the output of the system proposed (LPE was limited to ± 1. 72 cm). Response time was decreased for increasing forward speed and steering angle. Effect of forward speed on DE was significant whereas effect of steering angle on DE was not significant (0. 05 p). </p...|$|R

40|$|Ambient {{measurements}} {{suggest that}} source inventories of PM 10 from geologic sources are overestimated by 50 percent or more. This discrepancy {{may be due}} to inaccurate emission calculations and/or due to the rapid deposition of PM 10 after entrainment into the atmosphere. A two-wavelength scanning backscatter lidar was used to investigate PM 10 deposition rates from artificially generated fugitive dust. Dust was generated by vehicles on unpaved roads, a <b>tilling</b> <b>operation,</b> and from a blower fan, that dispersed known amounts of finely ground calcium carbonate or native soils. The size and concentration of the resulting dust plumes were monitored for up to a half-hour and a distance of several kilometers. The changes in these dust plumes’ characteristics with time are depicted using a lidar to measure the relationship between backscatter and extinction at two wavelengths. An outdoor test chamber was prepared and used to examine the particulate size distribution and optical scattering properties of several different natural dust types and different preparations of powdered CaCO 3 samples under controlled conditions.

40|$|THE AIM of {{this study}} was to analyze {{patients}} suffering from penetrating colon injuries management, clinical outcomes and factors, which predict higher morbidity and complications rate. METHODS: this was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients with injured colon from 1995 to 2008. Age, time <b>till</b> <b>operation,</b> systolic blood pressure, part of injured colon, fecal contamination, PATI were registered. Monovariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine higher morbidity predictive factors. RESULTS: 61 patients had penetrating colon injuries. Major fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg are independent factors determining the fecal diversion operation. Primary repair group analysis establish that major fecal contamination and systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg OR= 4, 2 and 0, 96 were significant risk factors, which have contributed to the development of postoperative complications. And systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg and PATI 20 predict OR= 0, 05 and 2, 61 higher morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity and hypotension were determined to be crucial in choice of performing fecal diversion or primary repair.
