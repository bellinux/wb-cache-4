50|$|To {{capture the}} American market, the 6T Thunderbird used {{a variant of}} the earlier Speed Twin's {{parallel}} twin engine, bored out from 500 cc to 650 cc to give the added horsepower American customers demanded. The concept of enlarging the Speed Twin, the Thunderbird name and its 'paper dart' logo were thought up by managing director Edward Turner on one of his regular trips to Triumph's operations in the USA. The 'paper dart' logo was embossed onto <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> cover on Thunderbirds from 1955 to 1962 and can be seen upon closer examination on the supplied photograph of the 1962 model. Previously, it appeared as a decal on the headlamp nacelle.|$|E

By comparing the experimental data with the DMRG results carefully, we finally obtain the ratio of the nearest and next-nearest exchange couplings as J_ 1 /J_ 2 = 0. 25 with J_ 2 /k_B= 16. 3 K.
