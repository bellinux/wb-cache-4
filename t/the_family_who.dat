5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a friend of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> {{was a member}} of the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E

He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>who</b> tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E

5|$|Clan Maclachlan claims {{descent from}} Lachlan Mor, {{who lived on}} the shores of Loch Fyne in the 13th century. Lachlan belonged to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> {{originally}} emigrated from Ireland to Scotland in the 11th century. The progenitor of this family, Anrothan, son of Aodh O'Neil, king of the north of Ireland, is said to have married the heiress of the King of Scots and gained lands campaigning there. Moncreiffe wrote that it was more likely Anrothan married a daughter of the local king of Argyll or a sub-king of Cowal and through this marriage, Anrothan's descendants gained control of the lands of Knapdale and Cowal, and several Scottish clans claim a descent from him including Clan MacNeil of Barra, Clan Lamont, Clan MacEwen of Otter, and the MacSweens who became the Irish Sweeney Clan who left Scotland and returned to Ireland in the 14th century as leaders of Gallowglass.|$|E

As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists fled into the dense jungles of the Mekong Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards. From 1777 onwards, the military balance between the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E
5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E

5|$|The first {{industries}} {{to develop in}} the town were coal mining and salt panning, which {{date back to the}} early sixteenth century. Early manufacturing both in Kirkcaldy and neighbouring Pathhead consisted of coarse cloth and nailmaking; the latter of which went to the Royal Master of Works for repairs at Holyrood Palace until the seventeenth century. Linen weaving, which began in 1672, became important to the town, with yarn imported from Hamburg and Bremen. The pottery industry, which was originally established in 1714 as an offshoot of the Linktown Brick and Tile Works, was centred around Linktown, Gallatown and Sinclairtown. The Fife Pottery, built by Andrew and Archibald Grey in 1817, produced Wemyss Ware, named after <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> owned Wemyss Castle.|$|E

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship {{and how it is}} housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|E

5|$|The central {{business}} district, {{also known}} as the Village Center, is located on Briarcliff Manor's main street on Pleasantville Road and continues on North State Road. The area has numerous businesses lining Pleasantville Road, a large expansion from the three stores that existed there in 1906. The business district is home to the village hall and a pocket park, and has brick sidewalks, period street lighting, and free parking. Farther south along the road is the Walter W. Law Memorial Park, and further east along the road are the three schools of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District. The Village Center contains a number of pre-Revolutionary War houses, including the Whitson House, built during the 1770s and the former home of Richard Whitson (one of the Whitson brothers, after whom Whitson's Corners was named); Buckhout House, also dating to the 1770s and named for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>who</b> lived there for over a century and the oldest, Century Homestead, dating to about 1767 and first owned by Reuben Whitson. The Washburn House, another pre-Revolutionary house, was sold by the New York State Commission on Forfeiture to Joseph Washburn in 1775.|$|E
