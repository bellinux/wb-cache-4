5|$|In April 1966, {{at the age}} of 26, Chatwin was {{promoted}} to a director of Sotheby's, a position <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of objects from the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance {{of the battlefield}} from a hilltop. He saw that the Egyptians {{had set up a}} strong blocking position defending the junction, composed of Egyptian tanks situated in hull-down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and the now-dry irrigation ditches of the Chinese Farm. The infantry were from the 16th Brigade's right-flank battalion and had the support of recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and some manually guided AT-3 Sagger missiles. Reshef discovered that the Egyptians had mined both sides of Lexicon Road, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost several of his tanks.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which}} the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

5|$|While {{he would}} not appoint any Democrats, Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation's diverse interests, and so apportioned the seats geographically. He also avoided {{choosing}} prominent Whigs, sidestepping such obvious selections as Clay. He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration, offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State, but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just been elected. Taylor settled instead on Senator John M. Clayton of Delaware, a close associate of Crittenden's.|$|E
5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought {{a lot on the}} outskirts of town for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order.

He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E

5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E
5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all {{the advantages of the}} previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E
5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states {{that he was so}} hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E

5000|$|In response, {{some black}} {{leaders such as}} Bishop Charles Henry Phillips of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church asked black people to shun {{violence}} in favor of [...] "patience" [...] and [...] "moral suasion." [...] Phillips opposed propaganda favoring violence, and he noted the grounds of injustice to the black people: I cannot believe that the negro was influenced by Bolshevist agents in the part he took in the rioting. It is not like {{him to be a}} traitor or a revolutionist who would destroy the Government. But then the reign of mob law <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> so long lived in terror and the injustices <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> submit have made him sensitive and impatient.|$|R

5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur {{had to deal with}} deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E
5|$|Ida's grandson, Æthelfrith, united Deira {{with his}} own kingdom, killing its king Æthelric to form Northumbria around 604. Ætherlric's son {{returned}} to rule both kingdoms after Æthelfrith had been defeated and killed by the East Anglians in 616, presumably bringing with him the Christianity <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> converted while in exile. After his defeat and death {{at the hands of}} the Welsh and Mercians at the Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633, Northumbria again was divided into two kingdoms under pagan kings. Oswald (r. 634–42), (another son of Æthelfrith) defeated the Welsh and appears to have been recognised by both Bernicians and Deirans as king of a united Northumbria. He had converted to Christianity while in exile in Dál Riata and looked to Iona for missionaries, rather than to Canterbury. The island monastery of Lindisfarne was founded in 635 by the Irish monk Saint Aidan, who had been sent from Iona at the request of King Oswald. It became the seat of the Bishop of Lindisfarne, which stretched across Northumbria. In 638 Edinburgh was attacked by the English and at this point, or soon after, the Gododdin territories in Lothian and around Stirling came under the rule of Bernicia. After Oswald's death fighting the Mercians, the two kingdoms were divided again, with Deira possibly having sub-kings under Bernician authority, but from this point the English kings were Christian and after the Synod of Whitby in 664, the Northumbrian kings accepted the primacy of Canterbury and Rome. In the late 7th century, the Northumbrians extended their influence north of the Forth, until they were defeated by the Picts at the Battle of Nechtansmere in 685.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
