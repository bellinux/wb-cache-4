50|$|Thus, the <b>terminal</b> <b>value</b> {{allows for}} the {{inclusion}} of the value of future cash flows occurring beyond a several-year projection period while satisfactorily mitigating many of the problems of valuing such cash flows. The <b>terminal</b> <b>value</b> is calculated in accordance with a stream of projected future free cash flows in discounted cash flow analysis. For whole-company valuation purposes, there are two methodologies used to calculate the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Value.</b>|$|E
50|$|T0 is {{the value}} of future cash flows. This {{equation}} is a perpetuity, which uses a geometric series to determine the value of a series of growing future cash flows. To determine the present value of the <b>terminal</b> <b>value,</b> one must discount the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Value</b> at T0 by a factor equal to the number of years included in the initial projection period. If N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Value</b> is divided by (1 + k)5. The Present Value of the <b>Terminal</b> <b>Value</b> is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied enterprise value.|$|E

In the research, the following methods were applied: The Scale of Religious Experience by Głaz—in order to define the level of religious experience: God’s presence and God’s absence, and Mehrabian and Epstein’s Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy—in order to define the level of empathy.

5000|$|Discounted {{cash flow}} models are powerful, {{but they do}} have shortcomings. DCF is merely a {{mechanical}} valuation tool, which makes it subject to the principle [...] "garbage in, garbage out". Small changes in inputs can result in large changes in the value of a company. Instead of trying to project the cash flows to infinity, <b>terminal</b> <b>value</b> techniques are often used. A simple perpetuity is used to estimate the <b>terminal</b> <b>value</b> past 10 years, for example. This is done because it is harder to come to a realistic estimate of the cash flows as time goes on involves calculating the period of time likely to recoup the initial outlay.|$|E
