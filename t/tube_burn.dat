Nanoenergetic composites, or nanoenergetics, have high surface areas, small diffusion scales, and consequently dramatically faster reaction rates. This thesis reports work done {{to characterize the}} combustion performance of silicon-based nanoenergetic composites {{in order to give}} us a better understanding of their properties {{so that they can be}} tailored to specific applications. Specifically, the combustion properties of silicon nanopowder(nSi) energetic composites and nanoporous silicon (nPSi) energetic composites are studied. ^ This thesis contains a thorough review the current state of silicon-based reactives, focusing on fabrication and combustion of nPSi-based energetic composites and also on the combustion of nSi-based energetic composite. ^ The Combustion properties of nSi composites were studied by performing equilibrium calculations, “flame tests”, instrumented <b>burn</b> <b>tube</b> experiments and micro capillary <b>tube</b> <b>burns.</b> Equilibrium calculations show that the maximum predicted flame temperature for many Si/oxidizer systems is about 3000 K, with some exceptions. Specifically, the calculated flame temperatures for Si/metal oxides systems ranged from 2282 to 2978 K. Theoretical maximum gas production of the Si composites ranged from 350 - 6500 cm 3 /g, with Si/NH 4 ClO 4 producing the most gas and Si/Fe 2 O 3 producing the least. ^ Composites consisting of nSi/NH 4 ClO 4, nSi/KMnO 4, and nSi/NaClO 4 x H 2 O were tested in instrumented <b>burn</b> <b>tubes.</b> The composite nSi/NH 4 ClO 4 showed the fastest burning rates which approached 530 m/s. ^ Micro-capillary tubes were loaded with nSi/CuO and nSi/Bi 2 O 3 composites. Successful combustion propagation of these systems was achieved in capillary tubes with inner diameters of 150 and 250 μm. ^ The combustion performance of oxidizer filled nanoporous silicon (nPSi) was also studied. nPSi samples with diameters of 2. 54 cm were fabricated by electrochemical etching. The porosity of the samples ranged from 50 % to 82 %. The samples were cut into 3 - 5 mm strips and filled with an oxidizer. The nPSi samples were filled with the oxidizers NaClO 4 x 1 H 2 O, Ca(ClO 4) 2 x 4 H 2 O, sulfur and perfluoropolyether (PFPE). The loaded nPSi was then burned by igniting the sample with a hot Nichrome™ wire. The experiments were recorded using high speed photography from which burning rates were calculated. The burning rates did showed a strong dependency on quality of the oxidizer loading. The nPSi loaded with NaClO 4 x 1 H 2 O produced burning rates that ranged from 115 - 550 cm/s. nPSi loaded with Ca(ClO 4) 2 x 4 H 2 O had burning rates of 145 - 285 cm/s. A sulfur filled nPSi sample burned a rate of 16 to 290 cm/s, and perfluoropolyether loaded PSi burned at a rate of 1. 4 cm/s. ...|$|R

Bacterial infections of patients and on the medical devices used to treat them represent {{a significant source of}} morbidity and mortality. There is also a significant economical impact to the healthcare system attributed to HCAIs. While bacterial infections per se are not a novel problem, the discovery of an adherent polymicrobial phenotype called a biofilm is. A biofilm is defined by its structure and the community of bacteria therein. This study investigated bacteria biofilms in a number of pertinent clinical scenarios. To achieve this, samples were taken from five different but related clinical areas where biofilms are known to infect or are suspected to, namely endotracheal <b>tubes,</b> tracheostomy <b>tubes,</b> <b>burn</b> wounds, chronic wounds and chronic wound dressings. Samples were analysed using microbiological and molecular analysis techniques, the latter included polymerase chain reactions, species-specific PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to assess microbial diversity. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization was used subsequently to analyse species orientation and biofilm structure within the biofilm. This study showed a diverse bacterial population in all the samples, with the presence of oral biota in the ETT specimens, changing to commensal bacteria over time. Large threedimensional biofilm structures were present in the specimens confirming the presence of biofilms, and within one of the chronic wound dressings where a complex biofilm was visible within the matrix of the dressing itself. These findings have considerable significance clinically, not only in demonstrating the need for biofilm targeted diagnostic techniques, but also in highlighting the need for specific biofilm treatment modalities in critical care, burn services and chronic wound management...|$|R

The reactivity of aluminum based {{energetic materials}} is greatly enhanced {{with the use of}} nanometric reactants. Silicon sees order of magnitude increases in burning rate when nano silicon is used in place of micron sized silicon. A broad characterization of the combustion of these composites has been undertaken. Theoretical equilibrium calculations have been performed, as well as characterization of combustion in the instrumented <b>burn</b> <b>tube</b> at various mixture ratios, and pressed pellet burns at different mixture ratios and applied pressures. A comparison of two morphologically different Al materials was also carried out using the instrumented <b>burn</b> <b>tube.</b> ^ Spectroscopic measurements were made of deflagrating SiTV and AlTV pellets. High-speed images were also recorded, and the synchronization of these with the emission spectra provided details the macro scale combustion behavior. Time dependent emission intensity was caused by growing product layers {{on the surface of the}} pellets. Temperatures for each mixture ratio were measured by emission spectroscopy and used as input to three simple combustion models. The Ward, Son, and Brewster model (WSB), the Koch model, and the Williams model were applied to AlTV combustion. The modeling results provided further support of the non constant pressure exponent theory, i. e., that AlTV burns in a transition region between a coupled flame and a condensed phase controlled reaction, resulting in pressure exponents that increase with pressure. ^ Micron sized doped silicon powders were manufactured by ball milling commercially obtained doped silicon wafers. Four powders using different dopants and dopant concentrations were manufactured. These powders were characterized to determine their average particle size, specific surface area, crystalline content, and electrical and thermal properties. The effect of the doping on combustion was investigated by way of pressed pellet burning rate measurements. The burning rate was found to correlate with dopant concentration, regardless of the dopant type. It is proposed that the doping effect can be explained by increased electron mobility or increased lattice defects, both of which are proportional to dopant concentration. ...|$|R

This work represents one of the first attempts to establish a relationship between bench- and large-scale toxic product yields for burning cables. This is difficult because the cables have been formulated for low flammability, and therefore do not <b>burn</b> consistently. The <b>tube</b> furnace <b>burns</b> the cable completely, whereas the large-scale test effluent {{is the result of a}} combination of flame spread and toxic product yields, both of which are fire scenario dependant. There is significant differentiation between cable types based on composition, and arising because only a portion of the cables burn in the large-scale test, accompanied by possible decomposition of hydrate sheaths. The fire stage of the large-scale test appears to have been replicated in an appropriate manner, given the correspondence of the CO 2 /CO ratios. The yields of CO 2, CO, HCl and smoke show reasonable agreement, given the differences in the extent of burning, and the accuracy of the mass-loss data available for the large-scale test. The yields and extent of burning have been combined to demonstrate the estimation of toxic hazard for a particular fire scenario based around the large-scale test, which shows only marginal sensitivity to the differences in toxic product yield between the SSTF and the large-scale test.

50|$|This {{very high}} power {{dissipation}} in the tube heats the glass walls to {{a temperature of}} several hundred degrees Celsius, and any dirt and impurities within are drawn off in the gasified form by the vacuum pump. The greatest impurities that are driven off this way are the gases that coat the inside wall of the tubing by adsorption, mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, and especially water vapor. The current also heats the electrode metal to over 600oC, producing a bright orange incandescent color. The cathodes are prefabricated hollow metal shells with a small opening (sometimes a ceramic donut aperture) which contains in the interior surface of the shell a light dusting of a cold cathode low work function powder (usually a powder ceramic molar eutectic point mixture including BaCO2), combined with other alkaline earth oxides, which reduces to BaO2 when heated to about 500 degrees F, and reduces the work function of the electrode for cathodic emission. Barium Oxide has a work function of roughly 2 eV whereas tungsten at room temperature has a work function 100 times more, or 4.0 eV. This represents the cathode drop or electron energy required to remove electrons {{from the surface of}} the cathode. This avoids the necessity of using a hot wire thermoelectric cathode such as is used in conventional fluorescent lamps. And for that reason, neon tubes are extremely long lived when properly processed, in contrast to fluorescent tubing, because there is no wire filament as there is in a fluorsecent <b>tube</b> to <b>burn</b> out like a common light bulb. The principal purpose of doing this is to purify the interior of the tube before the tube is sealed off so that when it is operated, these gases and impurities are not driven off and released by the plasma and the heat generated into the sealed tube, which would quickly burn the metal cathodes and mercury droplets (if pumped with argon/mercury) and oxidize the interior gases and cause immediate tube failure. The more thorough the purification of the tube is, the longer lasting and stable the tube will be in actual operation. Once these gases and impurities are liberated under pre-filling bombardment into the tube interior they are quickly evacuated by the pump.|$|R
40|$|The design {{principle}} of a specially adapted solid-oxide fuel cell power plant {{for the production}} of electricity from hydrocarbons without the emission of greenhouse gases is described. To achieve CO 2 separation in the exhaust stream, it is necessary to burn the unused fuel without directly mixing it with air, which would introduce nitrogen. Therefore, the spent fuel is passed over a bank of oxygen ion conducting tubes very similar in configuration to the electrochemical tubes in the main stack of the the fuel cell. In such an SOFC system, pure CO 2 is produced without the need for a special CO 2 separation process. After liquefaction, CO 2 can be re-injected into an underground reservoir. A plant simulation model consists of four main parts, that is, turbo-expansion of natural gas, fuel cell stack, periphery of the stack, and CO 2 recompression. A tubular SOFC concept is preferred. The spent fuel leaving the cell <b>tube</b> bundle is <b>burned</b> with pure oxygen instead of air. The oxygen is separated from the air in an additional small tube bundle of oxygen separation tubes. In this process, mixing of CO 2 and N- 2 is avoided, so that liquefaction of CO 2 becomes feasible. As a design tool, a computer model for tubular cells with an air feed tube has been developed based on an existing planar model. Plant simulation indicates the main contributors to power production (tubular SOFC, exhaust air expander) and power consumption lair compressor, oxygen separation). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.

40|$|The {{refractive}} index (RI) {{is an important}} parameter in describing the radiative impacts of aerosols. It is important to constrain the RI of aerosol components, since there is still significant uncertainty regarding the RI of biomass burning aerosols. Experimentally measured extinction cross-sections, scattering cross-sections, and single scattering albedos for white pine biomass burning (BB) aerosols under two different burning and sampling conditions were modeled using T-matrix theory. The refractive indices were extracted from these calculations. Experimental measurements were conducted using a cavity ring-down spectrometer to measure the extinction, and a nephelometer to measure the scattering of size-selected aerosols. BB aerosols were obtained by burning white pine using (1) an open fire in a burn drum, where the aerosols were collected in distilled water using an impinger, and then re-aerosolized after several days, and (2) a tube furnace to directly introduce the BB aerosols into an indoor smog chamber, where BB aerosols were then sampled directly. In both cases, filter samples were also collected, and electron microscopy images were used to obtain the morphology and size information used in the T-matrix calculations. The effective radius of the particles collected on filter media from the open fire was approximately 245 nm, whereas it was approximately 76 nm for particles from the <b>tube</b> furnace <b>burns.</b> For samples collected in distilled water, the real part of the RI increased with increasing particle size, and the imaginary part decreased. The imaginary part of the RI was also significantly larger than the reported values for fresh BB aerosol samples. For the particles generated in the tube furnace, the real part of the RI decreased with particle size, and the imaginary part was much smaller and nearly constant. The RI is sensitive to particle size and sampling method, {{but there was no}} wavelength dependence over the range considered (500 – 680 nm). Our values for the RI of fresh (white pine) biomass burning aerosols ranged from 1. 33 + i 0. 008 to 1. 74 + i 0. 008 for 200 -nm, 300 -nm, and 400 -nm diameter particles. These are within the range of RI values in the most recent study conducted during the Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiments (FLAME I and II), which were 1. 55 to 1. 80 for the real part, and 0. 01 – 0. 50 for the imaginary part, for fresh BB aerosols with diameters of 200 – 570 nm. There is no clear trend on the dependence of the RI values on particle size. The RI values derived from measurements of aerosols produced from the combustion of hydrocarbons and diesel cannot be used for BB aerosols...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{time delay}} {{detonators}} {{are used to}} control blasting operations in mines and quarries. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed for long time delays. However, soluble barium compounds may pose environmental and health risks. Hence {{it is necessary to}} consider replacing the barium sulfate with an alternative green oxidant that has similar burn properties. Anhydrous calcium sulfate was identified as a suitable, inexpensive alternative green oxidant. The initial part of the investigation focused on characterising the burn properties of the Si-CaSO 4, as well as proposing a viable reaction mechanism for this composition. Thermochemical calculations indicated that stoichiometry corresponds to a composition that contains ca. 30 wt. % silicon (Si). Combustion was only supported in the range 30 70 wt. % Si. In this range the bomb calorimeter data and burn tests indicate that the reaction rate and energy output decrease with increasing silicon content. The compositions were filled into rigid aluminium elements and assembled into full detonators. Burn rates ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 5 mm s? 1. The reaction product was a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous calcium silicate phase. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations is proposed. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 pyrotechnic delay compositions are employed commercially for intermediate to long time delays. However, there is very little information on this composition available in the open literature. The reactivity of this composition was therefore characterised and compared with that of Si-CaSO 4. The Si-BaSO 4 composition supported combustion in the range of 20 to 60 wt. % Si in the bomb calorimeter. However, burning was only sustained between 20 and 40 wt. % Si in rigid aluminium <b>tubes.</b> The <b>burn</b> rates varied between 8. 4 and 16 mm s? 1. These values are comparable to those for the Si-CaSO 4 system (6. 9 12. 5 mm s? 1). However, the CaSO 4 -based formulations tended to have a higher energy output and produced a more pronounced transient pressure response than the barium sulfate compositions. Both the calcium sulfate- and barium sulfate-based formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to contain water-soluble barium compounds. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg Ba per gram of barium sulfate reacted. The burn rates of delay compositions used in detonators can be modified by varying a range of parameters in addition to the stoichiometry. With this in mind, the effect of additives and fuel particle size distribution on the burn rate of the silicon-calcium sulfate pyrotechnic delay compositions was investigated. The burn rate decreased with increase in fuel particle size, while the enthalpy remained constant. The addition of fuels to a base composition of 30 wt. % Si-CaSO 4 increased the burn rate, with an increase from 12. 5 mm s- 1 to 43 mm s- 1 being recorded on the addition of 10 wt. % Al. Ternary mixtures of silicon, calcium sulfate and an additional oxidiser generally decreased the burn rate. The exception was bismuth trioxide which increased it. The Si-CaSO 4 formulation was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of inert material as the addition of as little as 1 wt. % of fumed silica stifled combustion in the aluminium tubes.
