40|$|Accreting {{millisecond}} pulsars show significant {{variability of}} their pulse profiles, especially at low accretion rates. On the other hand, their X-ray spectra are remarkably similar with not much variability {{over the course}} of the outbursts. For the first time, we have discovered that during the 2008 outburst of SAX J 1808. 4 - 3658 a major pulse profile change was accompanied by a dramatic variation of the disc luminosity at almost constant total luminosity. We argue that this phenomenon is related to a change in the coupling between the neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disc. The varying size of the pulsar magnetosphere can influence the accretion curtain geometry and affect the shape and the size of the hotspots. Using this physical picture, we develop a self-consistent model that successfully describes simultaneously the pulse profile variation as well as the spectral transition. Our findings are particularly important for testing the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>accretion</b> on to magnetized neutron stars, better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>accretion</b> geometry as well as the physics of discmagnetosphere coupling.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} {{of the results of the}} ASCA survey of LMXB with the Inogamov and Sunyaev <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>accretion</b> flow spreading on the surface of neutron stars. The ASCA survey of LMXB of Church and Balucinska-Church (2001) revealed a systematic variation of the luminosity of blackbody emission from the neutron star spanning 3 decades in total X-ray luminosity suggesting that the level of blackbody emission is controlled by the physics of the inner disk/stellar interface, which we can hope to understand. Two types of explanation exist: firstly that there is radial flow between the inner disk and star at all vertical positions above the orbital plane so that the height of the disk directly determines the area of star emitting. Secondly, the height of the emitting region on the star is not directly related to the disk properties but depends on the mass accretion rate as suggested by Inogamov and Sunyaev (1999) in their <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>accretion</b> flow spreading on the stellar surface. We find that the survey results for the emitting area agree with this theory at the lowest luminosities. However, for higher luminosities, the blackbody emission is stronger than predicted by spreading theory suggesting that the emitting area is controlled by radial flow between disk and star.
