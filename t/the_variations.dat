Seven European water bodies were sampled to assess <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> in pigment concentrations and population densities attributed to water body, station and sample levels. It was found that the main proportion of <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> between pigment measurements was explained by <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> between stations (12 - 91 % of <b>variation)</b> followed by <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> between water bodies (0 - 89 % of variation).

40|$|Textural-based {{processing}} of airborne magnetic data {{is becoming a}} recognised tool for image enhancement. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> method of fractal dimension (FD) estimation {{is a measure of}} texture that can resolve subtle textural contrasts as well as edge features that are otherwise difficult to discern. Application of <b>the</b> <b>variation</b> method to synthetic fractal datasets highlighted its ability to distinguish textural contrasts when using local estimates of FD. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> method was also able to enhance thin linear anomalies, linear ramp anomalies and sinusoidal ramp anomalies contained in synthetic datasets. <b>The</b> <b>variation</b> method clearly resolved these features even in the presence of Gaussian noise. The results demonstrated that smaller window sizes will more effectively discriminate and enhance edges.
