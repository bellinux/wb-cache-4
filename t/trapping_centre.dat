40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the thermoluminescence (TL) yield of silica-based optical fibres is demonstrated. Using silica obtained from a single manufacturer, three forms of pure (undoped) fibre (capillary-, flat-, and photonic crystal fibre (PCF)) and two forms of Ge-doped fibre (capillary- and flat-fibre) were fabricated. The pure fibre samples were exposed to 6 and 21 MeV electrons, the doped fibres to 6 MV photons. The consistent observation of large TL yield enhancement is strongly suggestive of surface-strain defects generation. For 6 MeV irradiations of flat-fibre and PCF, respective TL yields per unit mass of about 12. 0 and 17. 5 {{times that of the}} undoped capillary-fibre have been observed. Similarly, by making a Ge-doped capillary-fibre into flat-fibre, the TL response is found to increase by some 6. 0 times. Thus, in addition to TL from the presence of a dopant, the increase in fused surface areas of flat-fibres and PCF is seen to be a further important source of TL The glow-curves of the undoped fibres have been analysed by computational deconvolution. <b>Trap</b> <b>centre</b> energies have been estimated and compared for the various fibre samples.

40|$|The use of {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to date Pleistocene sediments is tested using light-sensitive centres in quartz: the Al hole <b>trapping</b> <b>centre</b> and the Ti-Li and Ti-H electron trapping centres. These centres have high saturation doses {{with the potential to}} date sediments throughout the Quaternary period. Samples from aeolianites of the Bridgewater Formation from the Coorong-Gambier coastal plain in southeastern South Australia were chosen for the test. These barriers have previously been investigated in detail and sufficient age control for the validation of ESR ages are available, with the oldest structure being beyond the Brunhes-Matuyama magnetic reversal at about 780 ka. The Al, Ti-H and Ti-Li centres were studied in 28 samples from twelve aeolianite units and tested in regard to gamma irradiation, bleaching, partial bleaching and isochronal heating. Equivalent doses using the multiple aliquot additive and regenerative methods were compared for selected samples. Regeneration measurements were carried out following bleaching and thermal annealing. Sensitivity changes were monitored using dose-recovery tests and spectral analysis. The applied doses in the dose-recovery tests could be recovered from the Al and Ti-H centres. Changes in the line width and amplitude for the Ti-Li and Ti-H centre occurred, whereas the ESR signal of the Al centre did not show any changes. On exposure to natural sunlight, the Ti-Li centre bleached slower than the Al centre, with the T-H centre bleaching the fastest. Equivalent doses for samples, using the Ti-Li centre, gave systematic overestimates compared to the doses obtained from the Al and Ti-H centres, which were the same for most samples. After consideration of the methodological results, the Al centre was chosen for age calculations. The majority of the resulting ESR ages calculated for the samples are in good agreement with the age-control data. The ESR signals for the older, Middle and Early Pleistocene samples were not yet saturated. These results are very promising and show the potential of ESR spectroscopy to date sediments throughout the Quaternary period...|$|E
40|$|The dose {{response}} of LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD- 100) chips was measured from 1 to 50 000 Gy using 100 keV X rays at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility. Glow curves were deconvoluted into component glow peaks using a computerised glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) code based on first-order kinetics. The normalised dose response, f(D), of glow peaks 4 and 5 and 5 b (the major components of composite peak 5), {{as well as}} peaks 7 and 8 (two of the major components of the high-temperature thermoluminescence (HTTL) at high levels of dose) was separately determined and theoretically interpreted using the unified interaction model (UNIM). The UNIM is a nine-parameter model encompassing both the irradiation/absorption stage and the thermally induced relaxation/recombination stage with an admixture of both localised and delocalised recombination mechanisms. The effects of radiation damage {{are included in the}} present modelling via the exponential removal of luminescent centres (LCs) at high dose levels. The main features of the experimentally measured dose response are: (i) increase in f(D) max with glow peak temperature, (ii) increase in Dmax (the dose level at which f(D) max occurs) with increasing glow peak temperature, and (iii) decreased effects of radiation damage with increasing glow peak temperature. The UNIM interpretation of this behaviour requires both strongly decreasing values of ks (the relative contribution of localised recombination) as a function of glow peak temperature and, as well, significantly different values of the dose-filling constants of the <b>trapping</b> <b>centre</b> (TC) and LC for peaks 7 and 8 than those used for peaks 4 and 5. This suggests that different TC/LC configurations are responsible for HTTL. The relative intensity of peak 5 a (a low-temperature satellite of peak 5 arising from localised recombination) was found to significantly increase at higher dose levels due to preferential electron and hole population of the trapping/recombination complex giving rise to composite glow peak 5. It is also demonstrated that possible changes in the trapping cross section of the LC and the competitive centres due to increasing sample/glow peak temperature do not significantly influence these observations/conclusions...|$|E

We found for silicon samples processed with plasma and subsequently boron implanted that the anomalous diffusion of the dopant atoms {{at the beginning of the}} annealing process is almost completely suppressed. This phenomenon is interpreted in terms of capture of the ion beam generated interstitials by the dislocations induced by the plasma processing. At room temperature the dislocations are observed to grow in size after the boron implant, attesting their efficiency as <b>trapping</b> <b>centres</b> for interstitials. Moreover, varying the plasma process conditions we can establish a general relation between the presence of the <b>trapping</b> <b>centres</b> induced by the plasma processing and the suppression of the transient diffusion.
