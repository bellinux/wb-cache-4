5000|$|The other switcharoo {{that we did}} ... is {{that this}} is a family that is run by women. Women have {{complete}} control and power in this mini-micro world. In typical television, we see the men run the family, and the women being nurturing and supportive. We flipped all of that. The women are in power, and the men stay at home and <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> This is a way of kind of celebrating the power of women, and being able to show the many layers of what they are capable of doing." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song is very {{meaningful}} to Fantasia {{because it was}} written as an anthem to inspire single mothers across the United States to follow their dreams. Fantasia has stated that [...] "Baby Mama" [...] is dedicated to [...] "all of those single moms out there who tough it out to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and work two jobs, go to school". Critics have accused the song sending the wrong message about sexual activity and pregnancy to teens. The song takes its title from the slang term baby mama. A parody of the song was made by comedian Rickey Smiley.|$|E

Going home to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> when the man doesn't: Is that a waste of a woman's time? There's no evidence that it is." [...] This view was then criticized by economist Charles Jones, who stated, [...] "Productivity could be 9% to 15% higher, potentially, if all remaining barriers were eliminated." ...|$|E

She took the knife and started to inflict wounds on my husband. Afterwards, she threw handful of salt onto my husbands exposed wounds. They tortured him like that for ten minutes. Afterwards, they forced a young Georgian boy (they killed him after) to dig a hole with the tractor. They placed my husband in this hole and buried him alive. The only thing I remember him saying before he was covered with the gravel and sand was: “Dali <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids!</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, saying [...] "Thanks to an {{invasion}} of green mold, the family shuts down the restaurant and hangs out at Mort's Mortuary apartments for a few days. Linda decides that this means it's time for the honeymoon they never had. Bob decides it's time to build {{the model of the}} bus from Speed he's been waiting to do since, well, Speed. The kids decide to go crazy, as they do. And Mort, being a gracious host, decides (initially) that he wants to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> Which is a great plan, until it means that Louise sets him up on a hot mortician's date and gets all the adults out of the building to explore the morgue. Hilarity most definitely ensues. It's not deep, and it's not quite as delirious as “Art Crawl”, but gags like Jimmy Pesto's Jamaican night are consistent winners. I think episodes like this are Bob's Burgers' baseline moving forward - weird, funny, and occasional springboards to episodes of sheer genius." ...|$|E
50|$|After another {{conversation}} in the kitchen, O'Reily finally manages to get Keane to agree to take out Ortolani, as Ortolani's victim in the shower was Keane's own brother. Meanwhile, Schillinger congratulates Ortolani on attacking a black and gay inmate, but Ortolani {{is not interested in}} neo-Nazi's opinions. He continues to brood and be of little help to the AIDS ward, mostly harassing his charge Emilio Sánchez about why he has AIDS. Sanchez reveals that he did heroin, and Ortolani says he never did heroin but dealt it, and Sanchez ironically suggests that maybe he got AIDS because of Ortolani. That doesn't go over well, and later, Ortolani angrily tells McManus that his job in the AIDS ward is not going to change him. McManus speaks to Sister Peter Marie and vindictively cancels Ortolani's conjugal visit, replacing it with a behind-the-glass visit between Ortolani and his immediate family. When Ortolani and his wife speak through the glass, he asks her to make sure she can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> but that she needs to go on with her life as though he were dead, which upsets her greatly.|$|E

5000|$|In two weeks, she builds {{herself up}} and even gets a {{well-defined}} washboard stomach (much to Homer's delight). She dashes {{out to the}} garden to get some lemons and, realizing {{that she is not}} afraid anymore, starts running around town. She runs into her mugger; even though the mugger does not move a finger against Marge, she beats him to a bloody pulp out of revenge in a scene that references the 1972 film The Godfather, when Sonny Corleone beats his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi. The cops arrive and arrest the crook, and Marge starts exercising even more. One day, as she jogs by an open-air gym at the beach, she runs into Ruth Powers, her old neighbor (seen in episodes [...] "New Kid on the Block" [...] and [...] "Marge on the Lam"). Ruth is also very muscular, and tells Marge that she owes it all to steroids. She talks Marge into using them, and also advises Marge to enter a women's bodybuilding contest. Using the steroids, Marge exercises harder than ever, becoming very muscular and estrogen-depleted, which results in a short temper and a violent streak. Homer, seeing these changes, finds himself less attracted to her. When Homer refuses Marge's sexual advances the night before the contest, she callously ignores his worries and then proceeds to pin him down and rapes him, before leaving him completely sore and exhausted to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> the next morning.|$|E
5000|$|Greg is {{also given}} the {{responsibility}} of waking himself up. He tries a better alarm clock than his older one, which didn't work, a wind-up clock. He put it under his bed so {{he would have to}} get out of bed to find it. But with the clock ticking loudly under his bed, he feels like he is on top of a bomb and therefore gets no sleep. As a result, Greg accidentally sets off the fire alarm at school in his sleep-deprived state. The entire school has to evacuate, and the fire brigade is called. After everyone goes back in, the head teacher says that whoever set off the alarm will be suspended and should turn themselves in. Greg does not get caught, but a rumor goes around that the fire alarm squirts out an invisible liquid when you pull the handle and the teachers could detect it with a special wand. Then everyone thinks that the teachers used this as a trick to see which kid goes to wash his hands first. No one goes to wash their hands, and since it is the middle of flu season, the school has to close early.Susan then announces to the family that they will get a maid named Isabella, since both parents are busy, who will help <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> after school. However, instead of doing her responsibilities, such as doing the laundry, Isabella spends her time watching T.V. and eating the Heffley's snacks, leaving Greg and the rest of the family work ...|$|E
40|$|Jennifer, 15, is {{a sophomore}} at Middlefield High School who has made an office {{appointment}} with Dr. Wilson, an ob-gyn, for the first time. During the new patient history, Dr. Wilson asks, “Are you sexually active now, or {{do you plan to}} be?” Jennifer hesitates to answer. Instead, she tells Dr. Wilson that the visit will be charged to her parents ’ insurance and asks whether what she says will be confidential. Dr. Wilson replies, “Conversations that teens have with their physicians about matters of sexuality and drug use are kept confidential. We want you to be able to discuss things that are of concern to you and your health without fearing that we will ‘tell on you ’ to you parents or anyone else. ” “Whew, ” Jennifer says. She then tells Dr. Wilson that she recently entered a pact with her friends. Each girl promised the others she would get pregnant within the next year. “And I want you to be my doctor, ” she concludes. “My goodness, Jennifer. That is quite a serious pact. We must talk some more about this. We must think about how having a child will influence the rest of your life, and how profound and difficult the consequences of this decision can be, especially at your age. How many of your friends are in this pact?” Jennifer responds, “Four of them. Our families will help us <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> We all know that. We just want to go through this together, before we separate and go to college or something. ...|$|E
