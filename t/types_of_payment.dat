25|$|To perform artisanal logging, the logger {{needs to}} obtain permit {{from the local}} government. With {{approval}} by the community chief, loggers can obtain a permit; yet, they have to report the harvest to local forestry technicians. These local forestry offices are considered the appropriate entity for approving the logging permits while {{they do not have}} the capacity to conduct forest inventory and forest mapping. Since the forest code does not have comprehensive mechanism to stop such logging activities, loggers continue to purchase logging rights from the local community. Depending on the scale of the logging, the community would demand different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> from loggers. One community in the North Kivu area, they demanded the logger to give them a 4x4 truck and upgrade the public infrastructures, which are not well provided for by the local government. Although the logger did not accept the request, this illustrates why locals want artisanal logging to exist.|$|E

However, for mobile payment to go fully mainstream, mobile devices like smartphones that are NFC-enabled must first become universal. This would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing (2017) as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become NFC-enabled for such a purpose. For instance iPhone 6 is fully NFC-enabled for mobile payment while iPhone 5 and older models are not. The aforesaid disastrous security risks connected with processing payment card usage through a POS system would then be greatly diminished.|$|E

50|$|The Form W-4 {{is used by}} {{employers}} to {{determine the amount of}} tax withholding to deduct from employees' wages. The form is not mailed to the IRS but retained by the employer. Tax withholdings depend on employee's personal situation and ideally should be equal to the annual tax due on the Form 1040. When filling out a Form W-4 an employee calculates the number of Form W-4 allowances to claim based on his or her expected tax filing situation for the year. The amount of money withheld as federal income tax is reduced for each Form W-4 allowance taken. No interest is paid on over-withholding, but penalties might be imposed for under-withholding. Alternatively, or in addition, the employee can send quarterly estimated tax payments directly to the IRS (Form 1040-ES). Quarterly estimates may be required if the employee has additional income (e.g. investments or self-employment income) not subject to withholding or insufficiently withheld. There are specialized versions of this form for other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> (W-4P for pensions as an example).|$|E
40|$|The {{essay is}} about the farmworkers that worked within a system <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> This {{consisted}} {{in one part of}} a small amount <b>of</b> salary as <b>payment</b> in money and the other two was for food and a place to live.

The use of debit cards in 2014 increased by 18% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. As for credit cards, it increased by 26% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. These two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> methods combined make up for more transactions than cash. Card transaction data has increased through the expansion of payment channels available to customers. Additionally, incentive and reward programs have increased the use of electronic cards for their benefits. The use of contactless and e-commerce payment has also allowed for a growth in card transaction data to increase due to the simplicity of the transaction. The use of Interact Debit transactions have increased rapidly in the last 6 years according to Interact Debit statistics. However, Canada has a lower rate debit use transactions by inhabitant in comparison to the United States, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, and Great Britain.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{different}} combinations of health insurance and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> and their influence on physicians' prescribing of antihypertensive drug therapy. Design: The study was based on information collected in physicians' practices, obtained from medical records and physician visits. The analysis uses simple logistic and ordinal logistic regressions {{in order to test}} the influence of {{different combinations of}} insurance profiles and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> on antihypertensive drug prescribing. Special attention was given to Medicare patients {{due to the lack of}} coverage for prescription drugs in this program. Patients and Participants: A sample of 1844 individuals diagnosed with hypertension was extracted from the 1996 US National Ambulatory Care Survey, a national probability sample survey conducted among physicians. Results: There was a significant reduction in the likelihood of access to drug therapy for patients insured with Medicare only compared to those patients with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> insurance. Patients with Medicare cover only that were in a Health Maintenance Organization or had a prepaid <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> were twice as likely to be prescribed antihypertensive drug therapy than patients with Medicare cover only and whom had other forms <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> such as fee for service or payment within a Preferred Prescriber Organization. Conclusions: The results suggest that the health insurance status of patients does have some influence on physician prescribing decisions for patients with hypertension, especially for patients covered by Medicare alone. This indicates that the lack of additional coverage for prescription drugs in the US health insurance system may limit access to antihypertensive drug therapy.
