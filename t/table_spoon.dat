Após responderem questionário com informações profissionais e sobre a TRO, os ACS a prepararam por três métodos. O teor de glicose e de sódio das TRO foi determinado e comparado ao proposto pela OMS. Na análise estatística foram utilizados ANOVA, Tukey e odds ratio. Participaram do estudo 52 ACS, majoritariamente mulheres e com ensino médio completo (90, 4 %). A adequação da TRO foi de 3, 9; 9, 8 e 28, 9 % para a colher caseira, colher medida e punhado pitada, respectivamente. O preparo da TRO com a colher caseira resultou em 88, 0 % das amostras com teor de sódio perigoso à saúde (> 101 mmol/L).

However, result of estimation of iodine content in salt maybe influenced by the obsener. This paper present the influenced of observers in the estimation of iodine content in salt using semi quantitative tes kit. Methods. Forty five house wives and forty five cadres in Bantul District, Yogyakarta were selected purposively as observer. Every test observer was asked to bring salt sample (3 <b>tables</b> <b>spoon).</b> The observation was conducted twice where the second observation was done 2 weeks after the first observation.

The results showed that observation test from 60, 46 % of house wives and 71, 10 % cadres at the first obsenation was similar to with the reference method. However, at the second observation test, only 52, 38 %, of house wives and 56, 82 % of cadres was similar to with the reference method (p> 0. 05).
