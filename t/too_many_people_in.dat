25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
500|$|Initial {{inquiries}} {{suggested that}} the collapse was probably due to overcrowding. This was backed up by neighbors, who told authorities that the balconies were designed to hold only between twenty and thirty people. Chicago's fire chief said that [...] "It {{appears to be a}} case of <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a small space." [...] Norma Reyes, the city’s building commissioner, said [...] "I have no indication of any substandard problems or insufficiencies with the porch at this time.

500|$|As {{a static}} structure, castles could often be avoided. Their {{immediate}} {{area of influence}} was about [...] and their weapons had a short range even early {{in the age of}} artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important. Cost also meant that in peace time garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glyndŵr's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.|$|E

50|$|Maclean later {{described}} his writing process:I drew a cross square, lines down representing the characters, lines across representing chapters 1-15. Most {{of the characters}} died, in fact only one survived the book, but when I came to the end the graph looked somewhat lopsided, there were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> dying <b>in</b> the first, fifth and tenth chapters so I had to rewrite it, giving an even dying space throughout. I suppose it sounds cold blooded and calculated, but that's the way I did it.|$|R
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{provides}} more {{detail about the}} einherjar. Gangleri says that [...] "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle {{since the beginning of}} the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E

5000|$|People cannot help {{being born}} and being there, {{but the concept}} of {{overpopulation}} can easily suggest {{that part of the}} people do not really deserve to be there, or that they should not exist. From there, it is only another step to hating part of the human race, and to feel justified in wiping that part out (or at least subject people to compulsory sterilization). If people believe that each human being has a right to be there and enjoy life, there cannot be [...] "overpopulation". At most one could say that there are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> living <b>in</b> a particular area. Even so, people can get used to living with remarkably little personal space.|$|R

60|$|So {{it is not}} all {{prayers for}} help that are heard, or deserve to be heard. And indeed--I {{do not wish to}} be hard, but the truth must be spoken--there are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world who pray to God to help them, when they are in {{difficulties}} or in danger, or in fear of death and of hell, but never pray at any other time, or for any other thing. They pray to be helped out of what is disagreeable. But they never pray to be made good. They are not good, and they do not care to become good. All they care for, is to escape death, or pain, or poverty, or shame, when they see it staring them in the face: and God knows I do not blame them. We are all children, and, like children, we cry out when we are hurt; and that is no sin to us. But that is no part of godliness, not even of mere religion.|$|E

It was {{more than an hour}} before Valentin returned, but when he did so he was able to announce that he had found one of his desired friends, and that this gentleman had taken upon himself the care of securing an associate. Newman had been sitting without lights by Valentin's faded fire, upon which he had thrown a log; the blaze played over the richly-encumbered little sitting-room and produced fantastic gleams and shadows. He listened in silence to Valentin's account of what had passed between him and the gentleman whose card he had in his pocket--M. Stanislas Kapp, of Strasbourg--after his return to Mademoiselle Nioche's box. This hospitable young lady had espied an acquaintance {{on the other side of}} the house, and had expressed her displeasure at his not having the civility to come and pay her a visit. [...] "Oh, let him alone!" [...] M. Stanislas Kapp had hereupon exclaimed. [...] "There are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the box already." [...] And he had fixed his eyes with a demonstrative stare upon M. de Bellegarde. Valentin had promptly retorted that if there were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the box it was easy for M. Kapp to diminish the number. [...] "I shall be most happy to open the door for YOU!" [...] M. Kapp exclaimed. [...] "I shall be delighted to fling you into the pit!" [...] Valentin had answered. [...] "Oh, do make a rumpus and get into the papers!" [...] Miss Noemie had gleefully ejaculated. [...] "M. Kapp, turn him out; or, M. de Bellegarde, pitch him into the pit, into the orchestra--anywhere! I don't care who does which, so long as you make a scene." [...] Valentin answered that they would make no scene, but that the gentleman would be so good as to step into the corridor with him. In the corridor, after a brief further exchange of words, there had been an exchange of cards. M. Stanislas Kapp was very stiff. He evidently meant to force his offence home.|$|E
6000|$|Pray {{for that}} spirit, I say; for {{we all need}} help. There are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world--too many, perhaps, among us here--who are not {{what they ought to}} be, and what they really wish to be, because they are weak. [...] They see what is right, and admire it; but they have not courage or {{determination}} to do it. Most sad and pitiable it is to see how much weakness of heart there is in the world--how little true moral courage. [...] I suppose that the reason is, that there is so little faith; that people do not believe heartily and deeply enough in the absolute necessity of doing right and being honest. They do not believe heartily and deeply enough in God to trust Him to defend and reward them, if they will but be true to Him, and to themselves. And therefore they have no moral courage. They are weak. They are kind, perhaps, and easy; easily led right; but, alas! just as easily led wrong. Their good resolutions are not carried out; their right doctrines not acted up to; and they live pitiful, confused, useless, inconsistent lives; talking about religion, and yet denying the power of religion in their daily lives; playing with holy and noble thoughts and feelings, without giving themselves up to them in earnest, to be led by the Spirit of God, to do all the good works which God has prepared for them to walk in. Pray all of you, then, for the spirit of faith, to believe really in God; and for the spirit of ghostly strength, to obey God honestly. No man ever asked earnestly for that spirit but what he gained it at last. And no man ever gained it but what he found the truth of St Peter's own words, [...] "Who will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?" ...|$|E
