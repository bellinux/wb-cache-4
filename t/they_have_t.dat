40|$|The {{promising}} clinical {{results achieved}} at the heavy ion tumor therapy project at GSI Darmstadt [1] prompted {{the construction of}} a hospital-based facility at the Heidelberg University Clinics. Here, delicate therapeutic situations are expected to be treated with a rotating beam delivery (gantry) equipped with a dedicated in-beam PET system. The detectors of such a PET system should cover a large solid angle, be of small volume and minimal weight and insensitive to magnetic fields due to the proximity to the beam bending magnets. The combination of crystals of cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) and avalanche photodiode arrays (APDA) could solve this problem. While similar detectors have shown their applicability to tracer imaging [2], their performance for inbeam PET is unknown up to now. Thus, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|H- 2 K mice injected, {{intravenously}} in saline or intraperitoneally in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, {{with large}} quantities of the immunodominant I-E k –restricted epitope from moth cytochrome c (MCC) 88 – 103 fail to respond to subsequent immunization with this epitope when administered in complete Freund’s adjuvant. This state of tolerance can be broken by immunization with certain MCC 88 – 103 analogues that are heteroclitic antigens as assessed on representative MCC 88 – 103 specific T cell clones. In this paper, the mechanism of breaking tolerance by heteroclitic antigens was investigated. The following observations were made: (a) T cell hybridomas derived from tolerance-broken animals required higher concentrations of MCC 88 – 103 to be stimulated than hybridomas derived from normal immune animals, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>T</b> cell receptors (TCRs) of lower affinity; (b) in contrast to normal immune animals whose MCC-specific TCRs are typically V� 3 � /V� 11 �, none of the hybridomas derived from tolerance-broken animals expressed V� 3, although they were all V� 11 �. Also, the V � complementarity determining region 3 (CDR 3) regions from the tolerance-broken animals did not contain the canonical structure and length characteristics of the normal MCC 88 – 103 immune repertoire; and (c) adoptive transfer and tolerization of MCC-specific V� 3 � /V� 11 � transgeni...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} {{the relationship between}} serum PSA and clinical variables to eliminate bone scanning in patients with prostate cancer having a low probability of bone metastasis. Methods: The study included 366 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer between 1999 and 2005. Bone metastasis was studied for its correlation with various clinical and pathological variables in these patients. Results: Bone metastasis was found in 28 (7. 7 %) of 366 patients. Fourteen patients had skeletal symptoms related to bone metastasis. The risk for bone metastases increased con-siderably with increases of PSA level, clinical T stage and Gleason score. The metastasis was not found in 161 patients with serum PSA concentration of 10 ng/ml or lower. In 95 patients with the concentration between 10 and 20 ng/ml only two had the metastasis. These two patients had T 2 disease and Gleason scores of 7 or greater. In 204 patients with clinical stage T 1 disease, one (0. 5 %) had the metastasis. In 117 patients with Gleason scores of 6 or less, the metastasis was found in two (1. 7 %). Conclusions: For patients with serum PSA levels of 10 ng/ml or lower, bone scanning may be eliminated because of the negligible risk of bone metastases. In addition, scanning may not be necessary for those with PSA levels between 10 and 20 ng/ml, when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>T</b> 1 disease and Gleason scores of 6 or lower.

40|$|High {{performance}} microprocessors employ various advanced circuit {{techniques to}} achieve high clock frequencies. Critical {{sections of the}} design are often implemented in domino logic, a popular style of dynamic logic. This paper describes a new model for analyzing the temporal behavior of sequential circuits containing both static logic and domino logic. Our model integrates naturally with the SMO model for static timing analysis of sequential circuits. CSE-TR- 295 - 96 : MODELING DOMINO LOGIC FOR STATIC TIMING ANALYSIS 1 1 Domino Logic Domino logic is a popular dynamic logic family. A generic Domino gate is depicted in Figure 1. The operation of the circuit is as follows. When the clock φ is low, the internal node z is precharged, and the output node y is set to 0. The period in which φ is low is called the precharge phase. A rising transition on the clock permits to conditionally discharge the internal node y through the pulldown network. The values of the inputs determine whether the discharge actually takes place. This phase is called the evaluate phase. Once z is discharged, it will stay low {{for the rest of}} the evaluate phase no matter what values the inputs assume. Therefore, either the inputs have to settle to their stable value before the start of the evaluate phase, or they can settle to their stable value (a high value) by making a single rising transition during the evaluate phase. This condition, of inputs making at most one rising transition, during the evaluate phase is actually too strict, as will be illustrated later in Figure 5. The condition can be relaxed as follows. Inputs are allowed to make a single rising transition in the beginning of the evaluate phase. After this rising transition, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
