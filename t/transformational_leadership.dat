25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership,</b> which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E
2500|$|Accidents {{and safety}} in the {{workplace}} have become areas of interest to I/O psychology. Examples of psychosocial injury hazards of interest to I/O psychology include fatigue, workplace violence, workplace bullying, and working night shifts. I/O researchers conduct [...] "stress audits" [...] that can help organizations remain compliant with various occupational safety regulations. Psychosocial hazards can affect musculoskeletal disorders. A psychosocial factor related to accident risk is safety climate, which refers to employees' perceptions {{of the extent to}} which their work organization prioritizes safety. By contrast, psychosocial safety climate refers to management's [...] "policies, practices, and procedures" [...] aimed at protecting workers' psychological health. Research on safety leadership is also relevant to I/O psychology. Research suggests that safety-oriented <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership</b> is associated with a positive safety climate and safe worker practices.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: <b>Transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> is an {{important}} variable that influences team members’ perception of the team as psychologically safe enough to engage in learning behaviours. Research purpose: The study was aimed at investigating the relationship between psychological safety and learning behaviour in teams, {{as well as the}} moderating role of <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> in this relationship. Motivation for the study: For a team to be effective, adaptive and innovative and engage in learning behaviours, the transformational team leader must set the right climate in the team, where he or she welcomes the team members’ opinions, questions and feedback at no risk to their image. An understanding of this will be important in team leader selection and training. Research design, approach and method: Using a cross-sectional survey design, 57 work teams comprising 456 respondents in teams of 7 – 9 members were purposively sampled from five financial institutions in Accra, Ghana. Hierarchical regression and moderation analyses were run on the data at the team level. Main findings: Results indicated a positive relationship between team psychological safety and team learning behaviour, with <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> moderating this relationship. Practical/managerial implication: <b>Transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> is important in creating a climate of psychological safety that will enable team members to engage in learning behaviours. Contribution/value-add: The study provided theoretical and empirical evidence that, in organisational contexts, <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> is {{an important}} variable that can facilitate psychological safety and learning behaviour in teams. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{academic}} exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership {{have not done}} so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ. Antonakis argued that EI might not be needed for leadership effectiveness (he referred to this as the [...] "curse of emotion" [...] phenomenon, because leaders who are too sensitive to their and others' emotional states might have difficulty making decisions {{that would result in}} emotional labor for the leader or followers). A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only ρ = 0.11 with measures of <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership.</b> Interestingly, ability-measures of EI fared worst (i.e., ρ = 0.04); the WLEIS (Wong-Law measure) did a bit better (ρ = 0.08), and the Bar-On measure better still (ρ = 0.18). However, the validity of these estimates does not include the effects of IQ or the big five personality, which correlate both with EI measures and leadership. In a subsequent paper analyzing the impact of EI on both job performance and leadership, Harms and Credé found that the meta-analytic validity estimates for EI dropped to zero when Big Five traits and IQ were controlled for. Joseph and Newman meta-analytically showed the same result for Ability EI.|$|E

Knowledge sharing in work teams {{is one of}} the critical team processes. Without sharing of knowledge, work teams and organizations {{may not be able to}} fully utilize the diverse knowledge brought into work teams by their members. The purpose of this study was to investigate antecedents and underlying mechanisms influencing the extent to which team members share their knowledge with one another. Specifically, this study aimed to examine whether and how team members' team identification, psychological safety mediate the effects of perceived disparity on employee knowledge sharing. In addition, this study seek to investigate the moderating effects of <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership.</b> A correlational design was used to collect and analyze survey data. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of 240 Korean employees of for-profit organizations in South Korea. The findings of this study indicated that perceived disparity (PD) negatively predicted knowledge sharing behavior (KSB). Also, both team identification (TI) and psychological safety (PS) mediated the relationship between PD and KSB. Furthermore, the strength of the mediated relationships between PD and KSP via TI became weaker or nonsignificant under high <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> than under low <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership.</b> However, the strength of the mediated relationships between PD and KSP via PS became stronger and significant under high <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership</b> than under low <b>transformational</b> team <b>leadership.</b> The findings of this study can provide the conceptual basis for interventions that are designed to promote knowledge sharing within work teams.

Previously, Jakarta’s local governments lacked government transparency, holding high-level meetings under a close-door policy, sustaining a critical and fundamental flaw in policy-making and fueling government inefficiency and corruption. Social media radically increased the speed, reach and transparency of information. Yet, social media-enabled government transparency has not been sufficiently investigated. This research presents strategic use of YouTube by Jakarta’s new local government to “open doors” to high-level political meetings and other reform-oriented government activities for greater local government transparency. We conducted an analysis of 250 government-generated videos on YouTube viewed and liked by Jakarta’s 7. 8 -million net-savvy citizens. We conclude <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership’s</b> political will and strategic use of YouTube are the keys to advancing local government transparency and facilitating citizen engagement with government’s reform initiatives...|$|R

This particular leadership style is commonly used in organizations, due to its positive outcomes such as higher work engagement, motivation, and creativity in employees. Parker and Mason's 2010 study introduced a relationship between <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership</b> with work adaptation and work performance. The study stated that <b>transformational</b> <b>leadership</b> relates to adaptive performance by having team members become creative in the different strategies that can be used when approaching a certain situation which eventually leads to a higher performance.
