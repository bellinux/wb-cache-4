30|$|With {{regard to}} <b>the</b> CBPP <b>fences,</b> 83 % {{of the villagers}} think that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> provide {{positive}} benefits to livelihoods, when given the option between positive, negative or no change. From the remaining pastoralists, 13 % see <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> as having {{a negative impact on}} livelihoods, often stating that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> reduce livestock grazing, prevent the movement of meat, and cut off shortcuts to regional villages and cattleposts. When the 83 % of informants who see <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> as positive were questioned about their reasoning, 54 % replied that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> stop disease spreading from the north and 42 % stated that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> stop cattle from straying and reduce stock theft (4 % saw no positive impact).|$|R

5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton side of <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two {{get into a}} fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E

40|$|This chapter aims to ‘complicate’ <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> and fencing of Ceuta and Melilla. It {{discusses}} the emerging theoretical literature concerned with walls and fences in both {{historical and contemporary}} settings and examines <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> within their historical and geopolitical context {{as well as the}} tensions between security and humanitarianism that have been progressively reflected in their architecture. Furthermore, the chapter examines <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> as productive sites. This is done through a focus on the communities that encounter <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> in their everyday practice and a discussion of how <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> are producers of and sites of resistance. The chapter contributes to recent work on walls and fences that has argued for a more sociological approach to these complex architectures, seeing walls and fences as more than blockaders of movement or defenders of territory...|$|R

50|$|Also in 1990, Mendelson voiced his {{opposition}} to iron <b>fences</b> on <b>the</b> Duke Ellington Bridge in Rock Creek Park that were intended to prevent people from jumping off the bridge. He said <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> did not prevent suicide because there were more suicide attempts from the bridge after <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> were erected. An increase in suicide attempts from the nearby Taft Bridge demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> merely diverted, rather than deterred, suicide attempts in his opinion. Mendelson argued against putting fences up again after the Duke Ellington Bridge's scheduled reconstruction and instead post phone numbers for suicide prevention hotlines on the bridge. He was also opposed to building <b>fences</b> on <b>the</b> Taft Bridge.
