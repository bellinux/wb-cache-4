5000|$|Yosef was {{sometimes}} {{willing to accept}} rulings which rely on <b>the</b> <b>rulings</b> of <b>the</b> Ari zal, provided that these do not contradict rulings by Karo.

This position is contrary to many (but not all) traditional long-standing Sephardic rulings on Halakha, including by many Sephardic poskim to this day. In contrast with the position of Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai, who wrote that, [...] "None may reply after the Ari" [...] (that is, none may dispute <b>the</b> <b>rulings</b> of <b>the</b> Ari), Yosef argues that no special weight should be attached to <b>the</b> <b>rulings</b> of <b>the</b> Ari, and the ordinary principles of Halakhic ruling should continue to apply.
