50|$|Jordan {{was born}} in Ludlow, the {{youngest}} of 5 children. His date of birth has been given in various sources as 16 October 1922 {{but this is an}} error arising from Peter Kennedy’s inaccurate date of birth published in an old EDFSS magazine and repeated also on Fred’s first LP sleeve. At the age of 6 he won a £1 prize for his singing of “The Gypsy’s Warning”.At the age of 14 he left school to work as a farm labourer for three shillings (£0.15) per week. He learnt his songs from his father and mother, fellow farm workers and <b>travelling</b> <b>families,</b> supplemented with some from printed sources. His repertoire included songs which had been handed-down by the oral tradition from {{as far back as the}} era of Samuel Pepys and from the music halls of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He mainly sang these songs in pubs.|$|E
50|$|The Yenish, Yeniche (French spelling), or Jenische (German spelling), are {{the third-largest}} {{population}} of nomadic {{people all over}} Europe, living mostly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and parts of France. They {{are one of the}} most geographically widespread groups in Western Europe. They often claim to be descendants of the Celtic Helvetii, but it is commonly believed that the origin of the Yenish can be attributed to members of the marginalized and poor classes of society of the early modern period and the 19th century. Features of this historic Yenish were their economic, legal and social exclusion from the majority population and a consequent permanent migration. In this regard and also in their lifestyle, they resemble the Scottish and Irish Travellers.There are about 700,000 Yenish people all over Europe, over 200,000 in Germany, 35,000 in Switzerland, 3,000 in Luxembourg and the rest spread all over France, Belgium, and Austria. In the Netherlands the 'Woonwagenbewoners' are a small community of <b>travelling</b> <b>families</b> related to the Yenish people. In Romania the Yenish are known as 'deitsche Zigeiner' which means 'German Gypsies'. In Pennsylvania there are Yenish families with roots in Switzerland, Germany and Luxembourg. They are called Dutch Gypsies or Black Dutch.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 19 th century, {{political}} debates emerged in Sweden and Norway {{as well as}} in Finland concerning <b>Travelling</b> <b>families</b> – in this article defined as indigenous itinerant families whom the settled population pejoratively designated with terms such as ‘tatere’ (Norway), ‘tattare’ (Sweden) or ‘zigenare’ (Finland). In this article, these debates are compared, and the transfer of ideas and proposals between the three countries is analysed. It is argued that, on a local level, similar politics of ‘territorial exclusion’ were enacted in all three countries. This was, however, challenged by ‘liberal social politics’, a strategy aiming not at exclusion but at forced assimilation by means such as, for example, removing children from their parents. This strategy was proposed in all three countries, and socio-political agents were well aware of the debates in the neighbouring countries. But it was only in Norway that the most far-reaching proposals were realized. This is explained mainly by pointing at the way in which leading agents chose to act when trying to implement their proposals. The article also problematizes some conclusions drawn in earlier research, where the emergence of debates on <b>Travelling</b> <b>families</b> has been explained by pointing at the rise of ethnic nationalism. Instead, the article argues, the emergence of the so-called ‘social question’ in Western Europe in the 19 th century should be considered as an at least equally important background factor...|$|E
40|$|Since the 16 th Century, {{there has}} been <b>Travelling</b> <b>families</b> in Sweden, earning their living by {{itinerant}} trades such as horse-trading, scrap-metal-dealing and tinplating. The authorities often labelled these families “tattare”. They suffered from severe discrimination, and authorities as well as scientists claimed {{that they were a}} threat against society. These claims were often made with a racialized rhetoric. In the period ca 1880 - 1955, there was a heated debate on what kind of political measures should be taken against these families. This debate, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis, was sometimes referred to as the ‘tattare question’. Three main political strategies were proposed or adopted in the ‘tattare’ question. In the countryside, small rural districts invented a variety of techniques in order to exclude <b>Travelling</b> <b>families,</b> such as imposing fines on persons who accommodated them. Government authorities and philanthropist saw assimilation as a goal rather than exclusion. They proposed various types of programs, e. g. establishing orphanages in which children labelled as ‘tattare’ should be detained and transformed into “decent” and “hard-working” citizens. Especially in the 1930 ’s and 1940 ’s, there were also proposals for a policy of more or less complete extinction of the whole group. In these proposals, persons labelled as ‘tattare’ were to be systematically sterilized. Although none of these extreme proposals were carried out, the debate did without a doubt influence the implementation of the general sterilization and childcare acts. Many persons whom the authorities labelled as ‘tattare’ were sterilized or detained at closed institutions for children and juveniles in the 20 th century...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} asthma in travelling schoolboys and settled controls {{to determine whether the}} travelling lifestyle may be a protective factor in the development of asthma. Information was collected by parental responses to the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) questionnaire. The design was a cross-sectional study with descriptive and analytical components. The subjects were six to twelve year old schoolboys from all male travelling children in Cork and from a selection of settled schoolboys. In addition the study collected information on the predictor variables [...] age, passive smoking and number of siblings. The questionnaire was administered to 54 travelling boys and 129 controls. The parent reported prevalence of wheeze and related symptoms were all more common in controls compared with the travelling boys. The values were significant for wheeze in the last year (31. 3 % v 14. 8 %; OR- 5. 6, p = 0. 025), and for doctor diagnosed asthma (25. 6 % v 11. 1 %; OR = 5. 1, p = 0. 04). Schoolboys from <b>travelling</b> <b>families</b> have less wheeze and doctor diagnosed asthma than controls.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} initial {{findings from}} {{an investigation into}} the <b>travel</b> experiences of <b>families</b> where one family member has a developmental disability. In order to gain in-depth information on the subject, a survey and a small group interview were conducted with attendees at an international conference for family members of individuals with developmental disabilities. During the interviews, informants described their experiences of traveling with their family member with a developmental disability. Family members’ disabilities included Autism Spectrum Disorders and Down syndrome. Key themes and concepts that emerged included: preparations for <b>travel,</b> <b>family</b> members’ responses to <b>travel,</b> and <b>family</b> needs when traveling. Findings from this preliminary study supported the hypotheses that individuals with developmental disabilities do travel and that they have unique needs which, if addressed, can enhance their travel experiences. Suggestions for future research include assessing the tourism industry’s knowledge of and preparedness to provide services for individuals with developmental disabilities, and developing an action plan to involve and educate tourism service providers...|$|R
