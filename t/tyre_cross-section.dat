50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal <b>tyre</b> <b>cross-section</b> to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{motorcycle}} tyres {{is a clear}} progression of steady improvement in grip, allowing better acceleration, braking, and turning, along with improved comfort, safety, durability, and reliability. This progression has generally meant a steady increase in tyre width, {{so much so that}} Kevin Cameron noted the assumption among riders that [...] "bigger must be better in every way", leading to, [...] "the temptation to overwhelm motorcycles with the biggest tyres the owner can find." [...] While many advances in tyre materials and construction have yielded unalloyed benefits, at a given level of technological sophistication, every design choice, such as <b>tyre</b> width, diameter, <b>cross-section</b> curvature, and the geometry of the motorcycle the tyres are intended for is a trade-off and a compromise.|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the relationships between the tyre strain feature and tyre operating conditions based on finite element analysis and experiments {{for the development of a}} strain-based intelligent tyre system, which could estimate the tyre operating characteristics for optimising vehicle dynamics control and improving vehicle safety. A 175 / 505 R 13 tyre is adopted as the subject of this study. An efficient and effective material property determination procedure is developed for investigating the rubber and reinforcement material properties by experiment. Considering the possibility of the absence of tyre composite profile due to proprietary protection by tyre manufacturer, a novel imagebased method is developed to capture the tyre geometry feature from the <b>tyre</b> product cut <b>cross-section.</b> Both the 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models are created in the commercial finite element code ABAQUS. The generated finite element tyre models are validated with experimental data and then adopted to construct the comprehensive relationship between tyre strain feature and tyre operating characteristics. Experimental validation of these estimation models are implemented based on a custom designed test system. Finally, some recommendations are presented for improving the capability of the finite element tyre model and the strain-based intelligent tyre test system.
