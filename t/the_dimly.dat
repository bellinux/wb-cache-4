5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|Programmed from {{a desktop}} {{computer}} with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.|$|E

2500|$|The Australian {{broadcaster}} {{and critic}} Clive James gave a negative {{appraisal of the}} series. He called it [...] "...classically awful British television SF...no apostrophe in the title, no sense in the plot." [...] James continued [...] "The depraved space queen Servalan...could never quite bring herself to volatilize <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> heroic Blake even when she had him square in the sights of her plasmatic spasm guns. The secret of Blake’s appeal, or Blakes appeal, for the otherwise infallibly fatale Servalan remained a mystery, like the actual wattage of light bulb on which the design of Blake’s spaceship, or Blakes spaceship, was plainly based." [...] Screenwriter Nigel Kneale, whose work included The Quatermass Experiment and other science fiction, was also critical. He described [...] "the very few bits I've seen" [...] as [...] "paralytically awful", claiming that [...] "the dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist {{of a kind of}} childish squabbling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forming {{the western}} {{antechamber}} {{is an impressive}} gavit of 1261, decorated with splendid khachkars and {{with a series of}} inscribed gravestones in the floor. Note the famous carvings over the outside lintel. [...] The church houses Prince Smbat Orbelian's mausoleum. [...] The gavit was probably a four-pillar one. In 1321 the building, probably destroyed by an earthquake, was covered with a new roof in the shape of an enormous stone tent with horizontal divisions, imitating the wooden roof of the hazarashen—type peasant home. This made the structure quite different from other Armenian monuments of the same kind. The ceiling has four rows of brackets forming stalactite vaulting with a square lighting aperture at the top. A broad protruding girth over the half-columns, the deep niches with khachkars and the low tent-like ceiling almost devoid of decoration give <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit interior a gloomy look.|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{there it}} was far in <b>the</b> north, <b>dimly</b> {{outlined}} against <b>the</b> dark void of space that stretched illimitably beyond it, the faint suggestion of a flier passing, unlighted, through the Barsoomian night.|$|R
60|$|He {{held the}} door for the lad to pass out. As they stood in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted passage he closed it softly after them, and turned the key in the lock.|$|E
60|$|The baggage was {{carefully}} stowed away, and, after {{a look around}} <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted wagon-house, Miss Burroughs and Uncle Beamish got into the sleigh, and I tucked the big fur robe around them.|$|E
60|$|With an unceremonious kick {{he pushed}} the door further open and strode in. A woman was {{standing}} in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted passage. As the stranger walked in she bobbed him a respectful curtsey.|$|E
60|$|Far in <b>the</b> distance, <b>dimly</b> through <b>the</b> many {{thicknesses}} of intervening crystal, as in a haze {{that made}} them seem unreal and ghostly, I discerned the figures of eight people--three females and five men.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. He stared down at <b>the</b> bones, <b>dimly</b> visible in <b>the</b> recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down? ...|$|R
60|$|French, {{with his}} start, {{was the first}} to reach a horse. The cowboys galloped off through <b>the</b> shadows. <b>Dimly</b> visible, they now and then caught a glimpse of their quarry; {{sometimes}} he faded out of sight altogether.|$|R
60|$|She was silent, and in {{the gloom}} of <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit {{apartment}} {{he could not see}} her face. He drew a little breath of relief. The worst was over now. He continued tenderly, almost affectionately.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} one {{o'clock in the}} morning when I {{returned}} to the hotel, yet the porter who admitted me pointed toward the figure of a man who stood waiting in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit hall.|$|E
60|$|Her light form glided {{from the}} room, {{while she was}} yet speaking; and flitting along <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted passages, it {{disappeared}} {{in one of those}} turnings that led to the more secret apartments of the abbey.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked slowly}} along the gallery, and paused {{not far from the}} top of the short flight of oak steps. She seemed to be hesitating a little, as if afraid to venture farther into <b>the</b> large, <b>dimly</b> lighted hall.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> ladies <b>dimly</b> {{feeling that}} liberty {{was a safe}} thing to cheer, clapped their hands softly {{under the cover of}} the nosier {{clapping}} of a few radicals who knew what the speaker was really saying. Bradley did not cheer--he was thinking too deeply.|$|R
60|$|As {{the train}} started to glide away Miss Hammond walked towards <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted station. As {{she was about}} to enter she {{encountered}} a Mexican with sombrero hiding his features and a blanket mantling his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Lothaw hardly {{recognized}} those wasted Hellenic outlines as {{he entered}} <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lighted room of the dying woman. She was already a classic ruin,--as wrecked and yet as perfect as the Parthenon. He grasped her hand silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{know what}} the meaning is of the noise in here?" [...] said George Strong severely, as he gazed around <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> lit apartment, for the lamp was turned low. [...] "You boys are--gracious me! What's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|With a sharp {{catch in}} his breath he stood motionless. Inside the room the candle, {{fluttering}} in <b>the</b> draught, showed <b>dimly</b> <b>the</b> grotesque {{attitudes of the}} sleepers. Beyond the door there seemed to his over- wrought imagination a strange and stealthy unrest. He tried to whistle, but his lips were parched, and in a mechanical fashion he stooped, and began {{to pick up the}} cards which littered the floor.|$|R
60|$|They wound about, {{always going}} upward, for some time. The lights from <b>the</b> {{lanterns}} <b>dimly</b> showed <b>the</b> way, {{but it was}} a gloomy journey, and they were pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were coming to a second landing.|$|R
60|$|No reply. The {{voice came}} out of a cloud; <b>the</b> ship <b>dimly</b> showing like a ghost. We had desisted from rowing, and hand over hand were now hauling in upon the rope {{attached}} to the breaker, which we soon lifted into the boat, instantly resuming our oars.|$|R
