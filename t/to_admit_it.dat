5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Padang in {{the early}} 20th century Dutch East Indies, Samsulbahri and Sitti Nurbaya–children of rich noblemen Sutan Mahmud Syah and Baginda Sulaiman–are teenage neighbours, classmates, and {{childhood}} friends. They begin to fall in love, but they are only able <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> after Samsu tells Nurbaya {{that he will be}} going to Batavia (Jakarta) to study. After spending the afternoon at a nearby hillside, Samsu and Nurbaya kiss on her front porch. When they are caught by Nurbaya's father and the neighbours, Samsu is chased out of Padang and goes to Batavia.|$|E

5|$|The {{students}} learn {{during their first}} day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. Doris, overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity in the lunchroom, flees and meets Montgomery. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Doris befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. Leroy and his English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, clash over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that Leroy is illiterate and ashamed <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa {{that she is not}} working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is {{significantly}} more common among people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their sleeping partner since individuals with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} are often unaware of the condition. There is a stigma associated with loud snoring, {{and it is not}} considered a feminine trait. Consequently, females {{are less likely to be}} told by their partners that they snore, or <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> to themselves or doctors. Furthermore, CPAP is also perceived negatively by females, and less likely to be utilized to its full extent in this group.|$|E
25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative word here being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but even there he has <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> is only as suspicion.|$|E

25|$|In November 1952 Harold W. Parsons, an art {{historian}} and one of Warren's past companions, took responsibility for selling the cup and approached the New York collector Walter Baker, however Baker was hesitant to proceed. In February 1953 it was posted by Thomas to Walter Baker, however US Customs impounded the box requiring a decision from Washington <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> as pornography, it was refused entry to the US on this basis and took until October 1954 {{to be returned to}} the UK, by which time Thomas had died. After this event, a number of museums declined to buy it. Thomas' widow sold the cup to the dealer John K. Hewett. Hewett offered the cup to Denys Haynes, Keeper of the Greek and Roman department at the British Museum who then sought an opinion from his friend Lord Crawford, a trustee of the museum. However the decision went no further as they thought that they would never persuade the museum's trustees who were chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
25|$|While {{planning}} {{what to do}} next, Banzai and the Cavaliers are met by John Parker (Carl Lumbly), {{a messenger}} from John Emdall (Rosalind Cash), {{the leader of the}} alien Black Lectroids of Planet 10, currently in Earth's orbit. Emdall explains that they have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, but had managed to banish them to the eighth dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' leader, John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen others to escape. Now that Banzai has perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids. Emdall had shocked Banzai previously to allow him to see the Lectroids for who they are, and now tasks him with stopping Whorfin or otherwise the Black Lectroids will fake a nuclear explosion to start World War III that will annihilate the Earth and the Red Lectroids with it. The Cavaliers track down the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey, finding that their arrival in 1938 was told by Orson Welles' broadcast of The War of the Worlds until the Lectroids forced him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> was a work of fiction. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the eighth dimension under the pretense of a new United States Air Force bomber.|$|E
500|$|Burke premiered {{the song}} on 25 August 2009, on The Chris Moyles Show. [...] Before its release, The Sun had leaked lyrics from the song online.

500|$|... "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{generated}} controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line: [...] "Not even talkin' to Nicki, {{communication is}} breakin' / I {{dropped the ball}} on some personal shit, I need to embrace it / I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> / Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'," [...] Speaking of the line, Drake {{said in an interview}} with MTV News: [...] "That line in 'Tuscan Leather' isn't exactly where I am in my life right now, but like a year ago...eight months, seven months ago, it was how I felt, I'd done something wrong, and I wasn't speaking to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie later {{struggles to}} deal with Ruby's {{relationship}} with Casey. Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: [...] "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't {{want to see her}} getting hurt. She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo, and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly." [...] Casey's brother Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) tries to advise Ruby through her troubles. Although she was not prepared to listen, Darryl gave her a new understanding, a development that is said to [...] "surprise" [...] Ruby.

500|$|It {{is unknown}} in the {{official}} timeline whether or not Sonic returns any romantic feelings to Amy. In text, SEGA has alternated between stating that he sees her as somewhat of an annoyance, and declaring that he does indeed like her but is simply too shy <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> The few times that he has shown interest in her, it {{has been at the}} discretion of the player, such as in Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) where the player has the option of choosing her or Princess Elise in the Test of Love (although the events of this game technically did not take place), and in Sonic Unleashed, where the player can either accept or decline her proposal to go on a date. Furthermore, although the canonicity of the game is debated, [...] features an option to romance Amy through dialogue, and eventually confess feelings for her.|$|E

500|$|Floyd's {{position}} was that Congress had allowed Missouri {{to become a}} sovereign state and that now its only choice was whether or not <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> into the Union. Missouri came up again during the Presidential election of 1820. At issue was whether its electoral votes were valid, since it was still awaiting final approval of its constitution by the Congress. Floyd argued for counting its votes and the [...] "debate which followed precipitated one of the liveliest 'scenes' ever witnessed...". Disorder followed, and both Floyd and John Randolph were [...] "so persistent in their interruptions as to necessitate an adjournment of the joint session". A compromise was brought forward to count it as [...] "so many with the vote of Missouri and so many without it", but both Randolph and Floyd opposed this, which later prompted John Quincy Adams to describe their action as [...] "an effort to bring Missouri into the Union 'by storm.'" ...|$|E
500|$|One notable {{citation}} as {{an influence}} was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "I {{was trying to}} write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> [...] When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I {{should have been in}} that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 In Utero at the request of Cobain.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "Phases and Stages/Washing the Dishes", {{with the woman}} tired of caring for her unfaithful husband, {{emphasizing}} her domestic chores. This is followed by [...] "Phases and Stages/Walkin'" [...] where, after consideration, she leaves her husband at night, saying [...] "Walkin' is better than runnin' away, and crawlin' ain't no good at all". In [...] "Pretend I Never Happened", she advises him to forget her and continue with his life. In [...] "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Joint", her [...] younger sister describes the woman moving back home and sleeping late. Eventually, she overcomes her grief and begins a social life at the corner beer joint, representing her liberation with the lyrics [...] "(she's) dancin' on a hardwood floor, her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before". The final song of side one depicts the woman falling in love again but reluctant <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> because she fears that her story will be repeated.|$|E
50|$|Josh confronts Jamie {{in private}} at the event, admonishing him for compromising {{the truth and}} genuineness of his story for {{dramatic}} purposes. When Josh forces Jamie <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in front of Leslie, he excuses it, saying that it's a good story regardless of the fabrication, which throws Josh into a rage, but not before admitting that Leslie was right about changing his film. Outside, Josh and Cornelia reconcile.|$|R

500|$|Doggett phones Scully to {{tell her}} that Kobold claims Richman is at an old marina near Annandale, Virginia. Scully drives there, but is {{attacked}} by Richman. When Doggett and Reyes arrive, they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Richman dead. Scully explains that he was holding her at gunpoint until they arrived, then shot himself. After Scully's lecture to FBI cadets, Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and got away with it. Explaining that the word [...] "Dae/moni/cus" [...] was code for the chosen victims' names, in a game Kobold devised to culminate in his eventual escape from the asylum. That the [...] "demons" [...] angle was merely to get the X-files' involvement and that they were all thoroughly [...] "checkmated" [...] by Kodold. Reyes, though accepting of Doggett's theories, is still nevertheless disconcerted with the true feeling of evil that she experienced, and believes Doggett was equally out of sorts because, though loath <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it,</b> he too felt its presence.|$|E
500|$|Their {{action was}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference on 29 April 1963. The following day they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many white people supported them. In an editorial, the Bristol Evening Post pointed out that the TGWU opposed apartheid in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it,</b> but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, {{so you have to}} look for other options... I knew that the decision could go either way, but were expecting a yes. The hard thing is going to be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> doesn't work. But at least I would have tried." ...|$|E
