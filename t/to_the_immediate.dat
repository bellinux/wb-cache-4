5|$|Access to {{the park}} from the {{mainland}} is limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent {{to the park}} headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near {{the north end of}} the park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E

By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie.|$|E
5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed drumsticks, is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland on sandstone soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are divided and narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of drumsticks. The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E

5|$|Old Pine Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments, the oldest section of which is located <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> east {{and south of the}} church building. The earliest remaining gravestone dates from 1834, but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as 1759. The church's sign along U.S. Route 220 erroneously lists the date of the cemetery's oldest interment sites as 1792.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Homestead {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Ledyard, Connecticut and faces south on Avery Hill Road. The house overlooks 100 acres (40.46 hectares) of stone-walled pasture land that extends south to Stoddards Wharf Road. The two-story house has a shed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> east and a two-story barn to the southeast. Past the barn is a farm pond that is located in a small valley formed by Billings-Avery Brook. The brook extends west for a mile (about 1.6km) before joining the Thames River.|$|E

5|$|The Nazis {{implemented}} more anti-tobacco policies {{at the end}} of the 1930s and by {{the early}} years of World War II, the rate of tobacco usage declined. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht, the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. According to a survey conducted in 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> pre-World War II years. The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} effectively illegalised the ROIA and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> {{release of}} O'Brien {{and the other}} detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.|$|E

Along this stretch, NY9N serves numerous lakeside hamlets, the southernmost of which is Diamond Point, a community just south of the Lake George–Bolton town line. The route continues on, passing through the hamlets of Bolton and Bolton Landing, the latter of which is home to The Sagamore, a resort situated on an island in Lake George.|$|E

The incident resulted in an investigation by the Nuclear Reactor Advisory Committee into its review processes for reactor experiments, after the AEC determined there was inadequate review of the UW experiment. The staff were praised by the AEC for their actions to avoid endangering the public, by sealing the materials and evacuating the building for six hours.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> {{south-west}} of {{the church}} building, St Botolph's Aldersgate owned an irregularly shaped churchyard enclosed by Aldersgate Street to the east, the Christ Church Greyfriars burial ground to the west, housing and the burial ground of St Leonard, Foster Lane, {{to the south and}} housing along Little Britain to the north. The churchyard was used as a burial ground and as a public open space. As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available burial space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as a burial ground.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E

5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{civilian}} morale in occupied Belgium {{reached an}} all-time low. The early {{successes of the}} Ludendorff Offensive {{in the spring of}} 1918 were believed to have made liberation virtually impossible in the foreseeable future. However, during the Hundred Days Offensive, the Allied and Belgian armies launched a series of successful offensives on the Western Front. The Belgian army, restricted to the Yser salient since 1914, advanced as far as Bruges. German forces on the front in Belgium launched a wide retreat. On 11 November 1918, the German army signed an armistice. The ceasefire did not, however, lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> liberation of Belgium and sporadic fighting continued. The Belgian army gradually advanced into the country, behind the evacuating German occupying force.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{surveyors}} on behalf of Lord Fairfax had laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence along with other public buildings. Later in 1762 following the establishment of Romney, the school was rebuilt in stone on the same site. The stone building was erected on the site <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy. The stone building was a rugged square building that served as Romney's cultural center before the school was formally incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly, but the exact date of its construction is unknown. Romney Academy was first incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814.|$|E
