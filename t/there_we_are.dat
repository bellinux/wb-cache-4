25|$|The roundarm {{controversy}} {{came to a}} head {{before the}} 1827 season and MCC agreed to the staging of three trial matches between Sussex and All-England. Roundarm's supporters made the grandiose claim that their campaign was a march of intellect. It is difficult to discern anything intellectual about propelling a cricket ball with arm outstretched vis-à-vis propelling it with hand below elbow, but <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> What the bowlers were really after was of course to claim an advantage over the batsmen.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} {{generated}} controversy {{over whether the}} band's musical style and major-label status constitutes [...] "true punk". In reaction to both the style of music and {{the background of the}} band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented, [...] "So <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do." ...|$|E
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> smiling." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} theme in Engelmann’s work refers to professional manipulators engaging others in activity {{for its own}} sake regardless of its nature or consequences. In his last paper, [...] "Science under Siege", he warned of two sorts of religion edging their way into science. The first is the supernaturalist view, the sort of view held by Creationists. The second is more subtle. It is the naturalist view. Advocates of either notion urge us to believe things that cannot be put to the test. Whether God created the heavens and the earth in six days or whether there are parallel universes have nothing whatsoever to do with science no matter how gladly true believers would have it so. Central to all science is the testable hypothesis. If it is not <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not talking about science.|$|E

50|$|The {{three months}} we spent in Cambodia were dreadful. Sheer hell. A nightmare. <b>There</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> all of us, knee deep in lizards {{and all kinds}} of horrible insects. And {{everyone}} hating us. Awful.|$|R
