5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> <b>and</b> of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{has been}} measured in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> using astronomical observations. Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided {{as a side}} effect of the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E
5|$|In March 1801, Frederick Accum {{was offered}} a {{position}} at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford. Accepting the position, he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy, who had been hired {{at the same time}} as director of <b>the</b> <b>laboratory,</b> <b>and</b> would later become the president of the Royal Society. Accum’s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been the driving force behind securing a position for Accum.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} effort initially concentrated on a gun-type fission weapon using plutonium called Thin Man. In April 1944, the Los Alamos Laboratory {{determined that the}} rate of spontaneous fission in plutonium bred in a nuclear reactor was too great due to the presence of plutonium-240 and would cause a predetonation, a nuclear chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. Oppenheimer then reorganized <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> orchestrated an all-out and ultimately successful effort on an alternative design proposed by John von Neumann, an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was called Fat Man. A variant of the gun-type design known as Little Boy was developed using uranium-235.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> then {{returned}} to the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E

5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element that has only been created in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> has not been observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers {{to the city of}} Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60milliseconds. A fifth isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Observed {{by humans}} {{since the dawn}} of history, the {{behaviour}} of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures. Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Cyathus stercoreus, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of taxa in the basidiomycetes that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Basidiospores produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After dispersal, the spores germinate and grow into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic (containing two nuclei) mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After {{a period of time}} (approximately 40 days when grown from pure culture in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory)</b> <b>and</b> under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R.crustosa. R.virescens fruits singly or scattered {{on the ground in}} both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees such as oak, European beech, and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R.virescens has a ribonuclease enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> in the textile industry.|$|E

5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} used in <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order}} of , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.|$|E
