Using the RMT- 150 C rock {{mechanics}} test system, the instantaneous triaxial compression tests for muddy siltstone {{were carried out}} under different <b>confining</b> pressures, and <b>the</b> instantaneous mechanical properties of soft rock were obtained. The {{results show that the}} strength parameters of sample have a positive linear relation with <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> pressure, and <b>the</b> sensitivity of peak strength on <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> pressure is higher than that of residual strength. The elastic and deformation modulus of sample linearly increase with <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> pressure going up, and the elastic modulus is more sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> pressure. <b>The</b> soft rock sample shows typical ductility failure characteristic, while the damage characteristic is mainly shear failure and the shear failure angle linearly decreases with <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> pressure going up...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>confining</b> stress {{acting on}} the {{concrete}} in a concrete-filled steel tube {{is dependent on the}} lateral strain of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> concrete whilst <b>the</b> lateral strain of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> concrete is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> stress. Hence, <b>the</b> lateral strain and confining stress are inter-related. Up to now, it remains a difficult task to evaluate the lateral strain of concrete confined by a steel tube and <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> stress {{acting on the}} concrete. To resolve this problem, a theoretical model for evaluating the lateral strain and confining stress in a concrete-filled steel tube system at various stages of loading is developed. The theoretical model is first applied to analyze concrete-filled steel tube specimens tested by other researchers to verify its accuracy and then used to work out the required thickness-to-diameter ratios of steel tubes for achieving different levels of ductility...|$|R

The use of the isobaric-isothermal ensemble allows estimating the effect of confinement and surface chemistry on the density of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> ionic liquid. <b>The</b> structure of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> ionic liquid is investigated using density profiles and structural order parameters while its dynamics is assessed by determining the mobility and ionic conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> phase. Despite <b>the</b> important screening of the electrostatic interactions (owing to the small Debye length in ionic liquids), the local structure of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> ionic liquid {{is found to be}} mostly driven by electrostatic interactions. We show that both the structure and dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> ionic liquid can be described as the sum of a surface contribution arising from the ions in contact with the surface and a bulk-like contribution arising from the ions located in the pore centre; as a result, most properties of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> ionic liquid are a simple function of the surface-to-volume ratio of the host porous material.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} review on our recent {{experimental}} investigations into the phase behavior of the deeply cooled water confined in a nanoporous silica material, MCM- 41, with elastic neutron scattering technique. Under such strong confinement, the homogeneous nucleation process of water is avoided, which allows <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> water to keep its liquid state at temperatures and pressures that are inaccessible to the bulk water. By measuring the average density of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> heavy water, we observe a likely first-order low-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) transition in the deeply cooled region of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> heavy water. <b>The</b> phase separation starts from 1. 12 +- 0. 17 kbar and 215 +- 1 K and extends to higher pressures and lower temperatures in the phase diagram. This starting point could be the liquid-liquid critical point of <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> water. <b>The</b> locus of the Widom line is also estimated. The observation of the liquid-liquid transition in <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> water has potential to explain the mysterious behaviors of water at low temperatures. In addition, it may also have impacts on other disciplines, because <b>the</b> <b>confined</b> water system represents many biological and geological systems in which water resides in nanoscopic pores or {{in the vicinity of}} hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>confining</b> {{stress in}} FRP (fiber {{reinforced}} polymer) confined concrete {{is dependent on}} the lateral strain of the concrete but the lateral strain of the concrete is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>confining</b> stress.

60|$|But {{the truth}} of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that in the Superficies interceding two {{transparent}} Mediums, (such as are Air, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island Glasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or less refracting Power. For in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of Air and Sal-gem 'tis stronger than in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of Air and Water, and still stronger in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before; and still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting Liquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Turpentine. If Water be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, the Reflexion in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of those two parts is none at all. In <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis something greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still greater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their refracting Powers. Hence in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of common Glass and Crystal, {{there ought to be a}} weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried this. But in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> of two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible Reflexion; as was shewn in the first Observation. And the same may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass, or Crystal,) have no sensible Reflexion but in their external Superficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.|$|R
