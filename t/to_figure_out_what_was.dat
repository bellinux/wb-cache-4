2500|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information. [...] Ambulance service moved from 'first come...first served' or giving priority to whoever sounded the most panicked, to trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> actually happening, and the assignment of resources by priority of need. [...] This occurred slowly at first, with local initiatives and full-time ambulance dispatchers making best guesses. [...] Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. [...] As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to help them make the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that decision-support.|$|E

He explained to me what my character {{was going to be}} and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
