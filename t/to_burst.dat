Using this approach we show that bursting in coupled systems can have interesting behavior.

In particular, we show that Hopf/Hopf mode interactions can lead <b>to</b> <b>bursting</b> between in phase and out of phase periodic solutions and symmetry-breaking Takens-Bogdanov singularities can lead <b>to</b> <b>bursting</b> that randomly chooses between two (symmetrically related) limit cycles. 1...|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria <b>to</b> <b>burst.</b> In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
30|$|Complex dynamics, {{including}} quick {{period doubling}} cascades in square wave bursters [19, 20] {{can also be}} {{explained in terms of}} codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations, including inclination-switch and orbit-flips, that occur at the transition [21, 22] from tonic spiking <b>to</b> <b>bursting.</b> Recent breakthrough examples of novel transitions <b>to</b> and from <b>bursting</b> due <b>to</b> reciprocal interactions of slow-fast dynamics include various homoclinic of saddles and saddle-foci, the blue sky catastrophe, bistability due non-transverse homoclinics to saddle-node periodic orbits, canard-tori [13, 16 – 18, 23 – 26].

On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and had a propensity <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> into flames. More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along {{the east coast}}, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10–15inches (250–380mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam <b>to</b> <b>burst,</b> killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Stromboli, which has been erupting continuously for centuries. Strombolian eruptions are driven by the bursting of gas bubbles within the magma. These gas bubbles within the magma accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles, called gas slugs. These grow large enough to rise through the lava column. Upon reaching the surface, the difference in air pressure causes the bubble <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> with a loud pop, throwing magma {{in the air in}} a way similar to a soap bubble. Because of the high gas pressures associated with the lavas, continued activity is generally in the form of episodic explosive eruptions accompanied by the distinctive loud blasts. During eruptions, these blasts occur as often as every few minutes.|$|E
40|$|We study {{statistical}} {{properties of}} the irregular bursting arising {{in a class of}} neuronal models close to the transition from spiking <b>to</b> <b>bursting.</b> Prior <b>to</b> the transition <b>to</b> <b>bursting,</b> the systems in this class develop chaotic attractors, which generate irregular spiking. The chaotic spiking gives rise <b>to</b> irregular <b>bursting.</b> The duration of bursts near the transition can be very long. We describe the statistics of the number of spikes and the interspike interval distributions within one burst as functions of the distance from criticality. Bursting oscillations are ubiquitous in the experimental and modeling studies of excitable cell membranes. Many models generating bursting have been subject to intensive research due to their physiological significance and dynamical complexity (see [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15] and references therein). Under the variation of parameters even minimal 3 D models of bursting neurons exhibit a rich variety of periodic and aperiodic dynamical patterns corresponding to different spiking and bursting regimes. The transitions between these patterns may contain complex dynamical structures such as period-doubling cascades and deterministic chaos. In particular, it was shown that the transition from tonic spiking <b>to</b> <b>bursting</b> in a class of bursting neuron models, so-called square-wav...|$|R

5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636–37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may have helped create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak might also have helped <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> the bubble.|$|E
5|$|With Gustave Bertrand's 1973 {{publication}} of his Enigma, substantial information {{about the origins of}} Ultra began to seep out; and with F. W. Winterbotham's 1974 best-seller, The Ultra Secret, the dam began <b>to</b> <b>burst.</b> Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) fight to get the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Although only a {{depression}} at final landfall, this was officially counted as {{a tropical storm}} hit on the United States {{as much of the}} circulation was on land before landfall in the area of St. Petersburg, Florida. In preparations for Marco, a tropical storm warning was issued for nearly the entire Gulf and Atlantic coast of Florida. In Florida, Marco caused flooding damage to houses and roads, in addition to producing tropical storm force winds across the state. However, Marco is more notable for the impact from the remnants, especially in Georgia and South Carolina, where rainfall from the storm peaked at 19.89in (505mm) near Louisville, Georgia. In combination with the remnants of Hurricane Klaus, Marco caused heavy rainfall in South Carolina, causing a dam <b>to</b> <b>burst,</b> leading to three fatalities. Several more fatalities were caused by the remnants of Marco and Klaus, and the system caused 12 deaths. It also caused $57million (1990USD, $ USD) in damage, most of it from damage or destruction of residences in Georgia.|$|E

The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since.

Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency.
