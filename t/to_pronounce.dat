5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E

5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name would be difficult <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{having taken}} Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in Westminster Abbey in January 1533. This was made easier {{by the death}} of Archbishop Warham, a strong {{opponent}} of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, going so far as <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> the judgment that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533). Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.|$|E
5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. They {{grew up on a}} farm in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname, however, as they all adopted ring names. One of the brothers explained that the brothers' real names were too hard <b>to</b> <b>pronounce,</b> so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E

5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the screen at a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E
5|$|M. N. Rajam {{was cast}} as Manohari, {{the queen of}} Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a {{character}} driven by jealousy and malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written {{in such a way}} that she would find it easier <b>to</b> <b>pronounce</b> them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R. Ramsingh was selected for the role of Madhana and Bhupathi's father, Veerabahu, after Ramachandran was impressed by his performance in one of the stage plays he featured in. J. P. Chandrababu played Veerangan's friend and sidekick, Sagayam. T. P. Muthulakshmi was cast as Nagamma, a native of Kanni Theevu, who wants a husband. G. Sakunthala played Manohari's lady-in-waiting Nandini and K. S. Angamuthu the restaurateur Pappa respectively.|$|E

5|$|As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a {{probable}} hub of illicit trade, and Francesco {{was forced to}} leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to illegal activity. Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town in the municipality of San Germán, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don ("of noble origin"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Cofresí, which was easier for his neighbors <b>to</b> <b>pronounce.</b> Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met María Germana Ramírez de Arellano, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ramírez de Arellano y del Toro, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano. Her family, descended from the aristocracy of Navarre, owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city.|$|E
