50|$|The <b>tidal</b> <b>dock</b> {{is almost}} entirely used for the import of timber from Scandinavia, Russia and the Baltic states, {{particularly}} the ports of Hamina (Finland), Kalmar (Sweden), St.Petersburg (Russia), Tallinn (Estonia) and Riga (Latvia).

50|$|From 1910 onwards {{capacity}} issues {{meant that}} the more modern and less <b>tidal</b> Barry <b>Docks</b> took over as the largest volume export point of coal. Until the early 1920s, Cardiff docks continued to boom {{as a location for}} shipping companies, but the fall in demand for Welsh coal caused a dramatic fall in exports. By 1932, {{in the depths of the}} Great Depression which followed the General Strike in 1926, coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tonnes and dozens of locally owned ships were laid-up. Despite intense activity at the port during the Second World War (which led to the attentions of the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Cardiff Blitz), coal exports continued to decline, finally ceasing in 1964. In 1950, imports outstripped exports for the first time in the port's history. The 1970s saw a short-term import boom, and in the 1980s the port experienced a slight rise in traffic, while much of the former port area began to be regenerated into non-port uses. The port found a niche as an important local centre for general cargo operations.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{container}} traffic was {{the driving force}} behind the growth in cargo handling in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Between 1995 and 2005 container traffic almost tripled, enabling Antwerp to increase its market share in the Hamburg-Le Havre range. Moreover, various recent studies indicate that container traffic will continue to grow strongly in the years to come. In order to be able to respond to these growth perspectives and to safeguard the future position of the port of Antwerp as a container mainport, a new <b>tidal</b> container <b>dock</b> has been built on the left bank of the river Scheldt, the so-called Deurganckdock. This dock will lead to large flows of internal port container traffic between both river banks. As the traditional hinterland transport modes offer insufficient capacity to accommodate the increasing number of containers in the long-term, it seems worthwhile to consider the idea of constructing a dedicated underground logistics system (ULS) to transfer containers between both river banks. This paper presents a first analysis of different variants of such a ULS...|$|R

The first terminal in this dock was opened on July 6, 2005. The full capacity of the dock is estimated at more than [...] The Deurganck dock has a wharf length of 5.5 km and consists of a total of 1,200,000 cubic metres of concrete. The Kieldrecht Lock, a new lock {{at the end of the}} Deurganckdock, giving access to the docks in the port area on the left bank opened in June 2016 and is the largest dock in the world. The lock is deeper than the Berendrecht Lock, the previous largest, in response to the trend towards ever-larger ships. The lock, which represents an investment of 340 million euros, is the second lock into the enclosed harbours and represents a failsafe feature; had the sole lock failed, any vessels inside would have been trapped, whereas it is highly improbable that both locks might simultaneously fail. On the landward side, facing the dock complex, the lock leads into the Waasland canal. From there the ships have easy access to all the other docks on the left bank: the Doel dock, the Verrebroek dock, the Vrasene dock and the North and South mooring docks.|$|R
