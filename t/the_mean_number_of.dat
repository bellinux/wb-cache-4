5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients being treated in hospice facilities {{on any given day}} was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E

One nodule selected at random {{was removed from}} each of 576 adult males, and examined by histology. The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> male and female worms/nodule, {{and the status of}} the female worms (fecund, non-fecund, or dead) were recorded. The observations were analysed to evaluate whether <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> worms of each category varied in relation to the patient's age, the level of endemicity in his village, the anatomical localization of the nodule, the weight of the nodule, and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> palpable nodules harboured by the patient.

Methods: Thirty adult male mice of the NMRI strain were selected {{at the age of}} 5 - 6 weeks and were randomly divided into 2 groups. In control group, 5 animals per cage (3 cages) and in stress group, 15 animals per cage were housed for a period of two months. All animals were anesthetized with an intrapritoneally injection of ketamine and xylazine after two months. The sample of blood from left ventricle of heart was provided by heparinized syringe. Serum samples were used for hormonal study by radioimmunoassay. Spleen was weighted after removing and the samples of spleen were fixed for light microscopic study. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> macrophage and megakaryocyte cells were determined. The data has been compared using statistical methods (t-test and Mann-Whitney test). Results: <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> weight of spleen and corticosterone level of serum was insignificantly reduced in stress group compared to control group. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> macrophage cells in stress group were insignificantly increased compared to control group.
