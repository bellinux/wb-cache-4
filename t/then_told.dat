5|$|Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert {{have both}} voiced Meg Griffin. Chabert left the series because of time {{conflicts}} with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five. When Kunis auditioned for the role, {{she was called}} back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He <b>then</b> <b>told</b> {{her to come back}} another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E
5|$|In Earth 2, Green Lantern Alan Scott was {{revealed}} as gay. In issue 3, Scott is revealed {{to have a}} boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so, however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash {{was caused by a}} force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is <b>then</b> <b>told</b> that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world.|$|E
5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, <b>then</b> <b>told</b> {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> she <b>told</b> him, whilst he {{sat there}} hunched and shuddering.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> Leonard <b>told</b> Soa what he {{had heard}} by the slaver's fire.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> I <b>told</b> our names, and in {{an instant}} the front door opened.|$|R
5|$|The nine-year-old Edward {{wrote to}} his father and {{stepmother}} on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his new year's gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January 1547, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay {{the announcement of the}} king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were <b>then</b> <b>told</b> of the death of their father and heard a reading of the will.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode to have Mila Kunis {{providing}} the voice of Meg. Lacey Chabert, the original voice of Meg, left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, {{in part due to}} her performance on That '70s Show. Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and <b>then</b> <b>told</b> her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were <b>then</b> <b>told</b> not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> Kurt <b>told</b> Anderson of {{the plot}} against his {{fortunes}} and his life.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>told</b> her {{the purpose}} of his visit, talking through the interpreter.|$|R
60|$|He laughed heartily. <b>Then</b> he <b>told</b> her the story. She {{listened with}} grave face.|$|R
5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|The White House sent a {{cable to}} the US Embassy, Saigon on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn {{and his mother}} needed evacuation. General Đổ Cao Trí, the {{commander}} of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him safe passage out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was <b>then</b> <b>told</b> that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise safe passage in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet Cẩn. On the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The electors were <b>then</b> <b>told</b> {{to break}} up the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> Reeve <b>told</b> {{about what}} Leo {{had done and}} what the boy’s {{aspirations}} were.|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> Godfrey <b>told</b> {{her that}} there was {{something}} else, and indeed all about the business.|$|R
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and {{the focus was on}} the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and <b>then</b> <b>told</b> of a wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler <b>then</b> <b>told</b> a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|In early 1914, Ruth {{signed a}} {{professional}} baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing {{are not known}} with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He <b>then</b> <b>told</b> Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>told</b> her--well, {{not quite}} everything, for he omitted his father's disparaging remarks about herself.|$|R

5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is <b>then</b> <b>told</b> by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{school in}} 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey {{tried to get}} a job at the Ford plant, <b>then</b> <b>told</b> his family he {{intended}} to become a greengrocer. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the Co-op, delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique, but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule. About a year later, during the 1937–38 season, Ramsey was spotted by Ned Liddell, a scout from Portsmouth, then a well-established top-flight club. Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post. Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again. He spent the next two years working at the Co-op while playing cricket in the summer and football in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after midnight, in {{the first}} minutes of 1 January 1966, Bokassa and Banza {{organized}} their troops and told them of their plan {{to take over the}} government. Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He <b>then</b> <b>told</b> the soldiers that they had to act now to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a matter of hours. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.|$|E
