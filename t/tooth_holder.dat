40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{study was}} to {{investigate}} if argon laser irradiation of enamel can increase the retention of fluoride. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Ninety-eight teeth in 12 patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) EF group: 40 teeth were only treated by fluoride gel (application for 5 minutes followed by 1 minute rinsing with distilled water). (2) EFL group: 40 teeth were treated the same way as in the EF group but they were lased after fluoridation. (3) E group of 18 teeth were kept without any treatment and considered as reference. In order to quantify the fluoride content in the enamel samples, the teeth were analyzed by proton beam delivered by a tandem accelerator (PIγE, particle induced gamma-ray emission). The fluoride content of enamel surface is not homogeneous. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the same enamel area after each treatment. Each tooth was maintained in a fixed <b>tooth</b> <b>holder</b> which was designed to analyze the tooth enamel surface at the same place (1 mm 2 and around 20 μm in depth) after various treatments. A low energy density of argon laser beam was used: 10. 74 J/cm 2, 30 seconds of irradiation time and 340 m W of output power. Results: The results after 7 days showed that the lased enamel still retained 157. 4 ± 23. 371 ppm or 42. 29 % of fluoride after fluoridation process whereas the unlased enamel retained 45. 59 ± 9. 377 ppm or 12. 25 % of fluoride. Conclusions: We concluded that the use of argon laser at low energy density (10. 74 J/cm 2) significantly increases the fluoride retention in lased enamel which had approximately three times more fluoride than the unlased enamel. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: This ex vivo study {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} the Root ZX electronic apex locator (EAL) (J Morita Corp, Kyoto, Japan) in determining the working length during retreatment of canals sealed with 2 different carrier-based obturating materials (ProTaper Obturator [Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland] and GuttaCore [Dentsply Maillefer]) and also evaluated whether they influenced its accuracy differently. Methods: Fifty extracted single-rooted human teeth with sound apices were selected for the study. We measured canals with the direct visual technique using a # 10 K-file and shaped them with ProTaper Universal instruments (Dentsply Maillefer) up to this predetermined length. After instrumentation, we determined the canal length again using the visual technique (direct length [DL]). This value was considered the ‘‘reference point. ’’ Specimens were then placed in a <b>tooth</b> <b>holder</b> (Pro-Train; Simit Dental, Mantova, Italy), and the canal length was electronically measured (electronic length 1 [EL 1]). Specimens were then obturated with ProTaper Obturators (group 1, n = 25) and GuttaCore (group 2, n = 25). Seven days later, a new electronic length was determined (electronic length 2 [EL 2]) during retreatment procedures {{in the presence of the}} obturating material. EL 1 and EL 2 values were compared with DL using the Bland and Altman method. The different influences of the tested materials on {{the accuracy of the}} EAL were calculated with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Both EL 1 and EL 2 values provided a statistically significant overestimation of the actual canal length (DL [P <. 05]), with the EL 2 values higher from DL. The 2 different materials did not influence the accuracy of the EAL differently (P =. 486). Conclusions: The measurements obtained with the EAL tested during orthograde retreatments can lead clinicians to overinstrumentation and consequent overfilling of the endodontic space.

40|$|Authors: Michelle Lee, Florian Muller, Elisa Aquilanti, Baoli Hu & Ronald DePinho ### Abstract Xenografting {{of human}} cancer cell lines {{injected}} subcutanously in nude mice {{has become the}} standard testing platform for dissecting mechanistic aspects of tumorigenesis and for pre-clinical drug development. However, subcutanous xenografts do not model tumors in their tissue of origin and thus may have some clinically relevant limitations. Xenografted human tumor cells directly injected into their relevant organ may present a more accurate model of human tumors. Here, we describe a rapid protocol for the injection of tumor cell lines into the mouse brain {{for the establishment of}} orthotopic tumors. ### Introduction Subcutaneuous growth of human tumor cells in immunodeficient mice is a mainstay of cancer research and anti-cancer drug development. However, it is known that the microenvironment influences tumor growth as well drug response. To better model human tumors in immunocompromised mice, cancer cells can be injected into the organ of origin (orthotopically), allowing organotypical interactions between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Orthotopic tumors may more properly recapitulate human tumor biology, as the interactions of tumor cells with normal tissue cells as well as stromal, vascular, and immunologic cells could have effects on cell survival and migration, and even developmental potential. Similarly, orthotopic tumors may recreate some physiologic barriers and could reveal important issues in drug penetration and metabolism. Located within the microenvironment of the highly specialized and protected central nervous system, orthotopic brain tumor models may have higher clinical relevance than conventional subcutaneous xenografts for understanding tumor behavior and for predicting drug efficacy. ### Reagents 1. Anesthetic (Ketamine) - Analgesic (Buprenorphine) - 1 cc syringes and 30 g needles - Sterile phosphate-buffered saline - Ethanol 70 % - Sterile water - Hamilton syringe and cleaning solution - Betadine - Alcohol wipes - Sterile cotton swabs - Disposable scalpels - Sterile ocular lubricant (Puralube vet ointment) - Forceps - Autoclip applier and 9 mm clips - Clip remover - Cells on ice: enough for 100, 000 cells per 3 ul injection - Immunocompromised mice: We use typically either use female SCID (B and T cell deficient; Taconic # ICRSC-F) or Nude (T-cell deficient, Taconic # NCRNU-F) mice between the ages of 6 to 20 weeks. ### Equipment 1. Micromotor drill and bits (Foredom 1070) - Stereotaxic device (Stoelting Elliptic Lab Standard ™ Stereotaxic Instrument) - Heating pad - Microscope light - Timer ### Procedure The procedure described below details how to perform intracranial tumor cell injection in mice. This is a major surgery and all procedures must be approved by IACUC or other animal use committee. Prepare cells for injection: - In the tissue culture room, typsinize cultured cells. - Wash cells with sterile PBS, and then resuspend in sterile PBS to an adjusted final volume of at least 100, 000 cells per 3 ul injection. - Cells should be transported to the injection area on ice. Set up: - Assemble the stereotaxic device according to manufacturer’s instructions. - Lay out the drill and drill bit. - Turn on the heating pad and monitor its temperature with a thermometer. Load Hamilton syringe with cells: - Prepare the Hamilton syringe by rising in 70 % Ethanol and then sterile PBS. - Gently resuspend trypsinized cells in PBS. - Draw cells to 3 uL in the Hamilton syringe, carefully avoiding bubbles. - Position the syringe in the stereotactic device, and tighten the screw to lock the syringe in the correct position. Surgical procedure: - Preoperative preparation: - Anesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine 100 mg/kg. Confirm anesthetic effectiveness by toe pinch. Wipe the mouse’s head 3 times with sterile cotton swab dipped in betadine, then swab with an alchohol wipe. Protect the mouse’s eyes by coating with sterile ocular lubricant. Make a 1. 5 cm sagittal incision in the mouse’s scalp from the front to the back. - Stereotactic immobilization: - Position the mouse in the stereotactic apparatus: first displace the tongue to the side with the wooden end of a sterile cotton swab, then position the front teeth in the <b>tooth</b> <b>holder,</b> next tighten the nose holder until firm, and finally place both ears in the ear holders. Once the mouse is in the correct position, tighten the ear holders until firm. Wipe the skull with a sterile cotton swab to remove the shiny membranes and to aid idenification of the bregma suture. - Cell injection: - Drill a hole 2 mm right and 1 mm anterior to the bregma suture. Lower the Hamilton syringe needle {{to the edge of the}} hole. Lower the needle 3. 5 mm, into the brain. Raise the needle 1 mm and wait 1 minute. Inject 1 uL of cells, raise the needle 1 more mm, and wait 1 minute. Inject 1 uL, raise 1 mm, and wait 1 minute. Then inject the final 1 uL. Completely remove the needle from the mouse’s brain. Remove the mouse from the stereotaxic device. - Recovery: - Close the skin incision by holding the edges with forceps and applying one clip. Place the mouse on the heating pad until the effects of anesthetic wear off, at which time the mouse can be returned to its cage. Follow up: - Clean the Hamilton syringe with Hamilton cleaning solution, then 70 % Ethanol, then sterile water. - Administer analgesic twice a day for the first 3 days after surgery. - Remove sutures after 10 days. - Monitor mice daily for signs of neurologic compromise. ### Timing After proper setup of an efficient system, 3 - 4 mice injected per hour can be passed through the procedure, which includes, anesthesia, injection, and recovery. ### Troubleshooting Some typical problems include injection of cells in the sub-cutaneous areas of the skull or into the membranes (dura, pia) covering the brain, rather than the brain itself. The ideal location is in the frontal cortex, with tumors cells located within the brain parenchyma near the lateral ventricles. As with all mouse surgical procedures requiring deep anesthesia, death from hypothermia can be an issue, which must be minimized by appropriate supportive care including monitoring and the use of a heating pad. It is of course advisable to include a positive control when first performing this procedure. Many established glioma and non-glioma cell lines rapidly and consistently form intracranial tumors when injected in this manner, including U 87 cells. A negative control would consist of normal, immortalized but non-transformed human astrocytes. ### Anticipated Results The tumor latency is dependent on both the cell line and the number of cells injected. The typical time to onset of neurological symptoms is about 3 months but can be as long as 6 months, or even longer. Volumetric measurement of intracranial tumors by MRI is possible but not practical, and is cost-prohibitive when using a large number of animals. Therefore, neurological symptoms, specifically abnormalities of gross motor function, are used as an endpoint for tumor latency. Neurological symptoms are indicative of a tumor that is sufficiently large to have displaced or infiltrated the mouse brain or to have caused obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow with resultant increased intracranial pressure. Dormant, non-tumor forming cells can remain alive in the cerebrospinal fluid for a prolonged time after injection: using anti-human NUMA (Epitomics 3402 - 1) that specifically detects human but not mouse cells, we have observed residual, non-tumor forming cells as long as 6 months after orthotopic injections. ### References Zheng H, Ying H, Yan H, Kimmelman AC, Hiller DJ, Chen AJ, Perry SR, Tonon G, Chu GC, Ding Z, Stommel JM, Dunn KL, Wiedemeyer R, You MJ, Brennan C, Wang YA, Ligon KL, Wong WH, Chin L, DePinho RA, 'p 53 and Pten control neural and glioma stem/progenitor cell renewal and differentiation.

40|$|Background/Aims: To {{assess whether}} {{childhood}} socio-economic status modifies {{the relationship between}} childhood caries and young adult oral health. Methods: In 1988 – 1989, a total of 7, 673 South Australian children aged 13 years were sampled, with 4, 604 children (60. 0 %) and 4, 476 parents(58. 3 %) responding. In 2005 – 2006, 632 baseline study participants responded (43. 0 % of those traced and living in Adelaide). Results: Adjusted analyses showed significant interactions for card status by DMFT at age 13 for decayed, missing and filled teeth at age 30, but not for DMFT. Higher DMFT at age 13 was associated with more decayed teeth at age 30 for those with no health card, while there were similar numbers of decayed <b>teeth</b> for card <b>holders</b> regardless of their DMFT at age 13. While higher DMFT at age 13 was associated with more missing teeth at age 30 for card holders, there were similar numbers of missing teeth for those with no card regardless of their DMFT at age 13. The interaction for filled teeth {{showed that even though}} higher DMFT at age 13 was associated with more fillings at age 30 for both card holders and those with no card, this relationship was more pronounced for card holders. Conclusions:SES modified the relationship between child oral health and caries at age 30 years. Card holders at age 13 were worse off in terms of their oral health at age 30 controlling for childhood oral health, supporting social causation explanations for oral health inequalities. D. S.

40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Thursday My darling husband- Well, at last it’s Thursday and you’re {{supposed}} to call tonight. I’ve been keeping my fingers crossed that you’ll {{be able to get}} off this weekend. Golly, darling, it’s been so darned long since I saw you last. Seems like a few years instead of eight days. Lord this time has gone slowly since you left last Wednesday. Nest Sunday we’ll have been married for two weeks. Yeh, married for two weeks + been together less than three days! That’s a great way to start! Everytime [sic] I wait for a call from you I’m a nervous wreck! Lord, honey, I’m all shaky + I’ve got butterflies during a rumba + golly, honey, I’m really bad off. Just wrote Mother + Daddy a letter. Send them the list of announcements. They’ll never be able to read it. Golly, darling, it’ll probably be about an hour no two hours before you call. My butterflies are really cutting up tonight. Golly, darling, it really is an emergency. We just got married + everything. He should understand. Maybe he’s not married though. This suspense. Time passing Well, honey, it’s seven o’clock now. Then after to be exact + I’m just about going crazy. That fool phone hasn’t even tingled. Why doesn’t it ring. I’ve tried to read + to eat + everything but, golly, honey, I just can’t do anything except wait. Golly, honey, I hope you’ll be able to get off this weekend. This suspense is awful. Washed my hair at Alice’s today. Her husband thinks I’m crazy. Mrs. Moseley just brought in a salad to me- she’s so nice. I was sure lucky to get a nice landlady. Most of them are awful stinkers from what the girls have told me. They go through their things + - oh listen to their conversations and are just about as agreeable as a zombie. Golly, won’t that phone ever ring – Wonder if it’s out of order or something- It’s seven fifteen now my nerves are really shot. If you can get off, honey, I have to leave here on a bus at 5 : 50. What an hour. All I’ve done since we’ve been married is get up at horrible hours of the night but {{if you were going to}} be there I’d get up at anytimes. Golly, I hope you got that pass I’m so excited about seeing you again. Golly, darling I hope it’s going to be all right. Can’t write any more. I’ll wait until after you call, honey. Nothing I say will be intelligent (no remarks) now. I love you so, Judd + hope we can be together this weekend. Here’s an example of what you’ll be up against when- “Crouched beneath a palm (tree) I heard a voice yell, “Hey, Lieutenant, what’ll I do with these prisoners?” Down the path sauntered a tall G. I. shepherding two disheveled Tojos. I was furious- “Listen” I hissed. “Don’t you know these woods are lousy with Jap snipers just laying for Officers? Call me Joe. Call me anything but don’t call me ‘Lieutenant’!” “Okay, Stupid, what’ll I do with these prisoners?” The Alabama jokes are even cornier than the ones from Pelham. A salesgirl was explaining the merits of a shaving kit to a prospective customer around Christmastime. (These were for overseas servicemen- “It consists of a pig skin case, military brushes, <b>tooth</b> brush <b>holder,</b> soap dish, gold plated razor, and a handy folding carton for him to send it all back home in. ” Well, I’m still waiting, honey. Darling you finally called an golly, honey, I’m so sorry that we can’t be together this weekend. It would have been wonderful though. Gee, honey, this certainly has been some marriage. It will be two weeks this Sunday and we’ve only been together two and a half days. Christmas, honey, we can’t go on much longer like this. I’m just about going crazy, honey. It’s awful. I’m so awfully lonesome + no matter how many people I meet it still doesn’t help any because you’re the only one who will make me happy. Good lord, honey, this is awful. I don’t think I can take much more of this. When you go overseas, darling, I really will go crazy. Hope it won’t be for a good long time though, honey. There isn’t any chance of your being made an instructor, honey. Darn it. I would like it but I guess that would be too easy. Lord, I wish this war would end. Golly, honey, I never minded being alone before but now I really dread it. I mean without you- as long as I know you’re coming home every night it’s all right. But I’ve developed the worst fear of being alone without you. Ever since the night we were married. Gee, honey, you think it’s bad for you- at least you have planes to keep you happy but it really hasn’t been so awfully bad. I just like to gripe about it. That was some conversation we had. All we both did was complain about how tough everything was. But, gee, honey, it certainly isn’t fair to have everything happen to us. Don’t know what I’ll do if you can’t live off the Post. That will be too much. So you think we’ll be heading for Lincoln, huh. Oh, well, I like traveling. How long will we be there? It will probably be over for you after that, won’t it, honey. What happened to this old pool they’ve had here for so long. Darn it. Everyone was here for at least a month after they graduated- usually three or four. Why does everything happen to us. Christmas, honey, what are they trying to do to us. I’ve definitely decided the Army doesn’t like wives. In fact I think they dislike them intensely. We must have the same weather here that you do because it poured here Tuesday, too. Yesterday + today were real nice. As I told you I’ve been trying to get a tan but all I got was freckles on my nose- they look horrid! Golly, honey, I love you so. Why can’t we be together- and listen, stop opening my mail. And after you finish reading it how about sending it to me- it’s a fine thing! Golly, honey, you’d better find those cards! And another thing- what was that remark you made about me doing some cooking because we’d get sick of eating out. You know as well as I do that we’d be a lot sicker if I cooked. Besides Mrs. Moseley won’t let me cook. She just lets me keep a few things in the ice box. Like milk + peanut butter. Going to get some fruit tomorrow, honey. Very exciting thought. Wish I had something to throw! I’m in a horrible mood. Besides I’m mad at the Army. They’re ruining our married life and they can’t do that to you. Golly, another thing I don’t like the way they don’t send your mail to you. Here I write + write + write and they don’t bother to send it down to you. That movin’ pitchers they have down there must be great. Eglin must really be a wonderful place. They certainly don’t run things right. Let’s you and I change things. Golly you’ve been down there over a week now and have only fired 600 rounds out of 3, 000. That’s really great. I’m just so happy. Why couldn’t they wait until the weather was going to be nice before they sent you down. What are weather observers, or whatever they have, for- Golly. I don’t like the way the Army runs things. Especially our lives. Why don’t you tell them how they should change that program. It sounds pretty dumb to me, too, honey. After all the trouble they take to train you to fly there to rush you through some course in 17 days that will be your life when you’re in combat. Ah, yes, the efficient little Army. They’re really doing great. Just great. Don’t tell me we’re going to get a leave. They’ll probably decide against it the day before we’re ready to leave. Did you know that everyone who graduated from Craig got 15 days! Why didn’t you to Craig. Golly, darling, we sure get all the breaks. (There are cadets who get the 15 days). By the way darling, how is your stiff neck? And how pray tell did you get it? Thought there were no women around there. My family are going to think its mighty queer when they receive my letters and none of them say very much about you. But, golly, I don’t want to lie to them. Well, honey, this certain has been a novel way to spend a honeymoon. You down at Eglin + me here at Selma. Nothing like a few hundred miles between a couple on their honeymoon. DO you think we will ever have one, honey? Honey, what do they put in that Florida sunshine or is it the PX that makes you write such crazy letters. You’re really getting crazier by the day. Gee, honey, it was so good to hear your voice. I’m sorry you couldn’t hear me very well but it was just as well because I didn’t have much to say. I am very discusted [sic]. I want a husband with me + a honeymoon + oh, honey, I just miss you so darned much. Guess, I’d better be getting to bed now. It’s getting kinda late now. Maybe I’ll feel better in the morning. There’s not much hope of that, at least not until Easter morning, anyway. Gee, darling, we’ll have to begin all over again. I don’t even feel married any more. Maybe I can get me a tan by the time you get back. I certainly will have enough time anyway. Why can’t they send you back Saturday night instead of Sunday morning? That would be the nicest thing to do. But no- They have to keep you down in that hole another night. Well, maybe we can be together on our third anniversary. Everyone around here thinks it’s a big joke. Hah, hah, hah- does that sound bitter. Well, at this point it certainly should. Everyone practically has hystories [sic] over the way things happened. We sure get all the breaks- Oh, well, it can’t go on like this- can it? Well, darling it won’t be much longer now. You should be home Sunday. I’ll be hoping anyway. Took $ 35 out of the bank today + in the mood I’m in I’d better hurry and get it back before I go out + spend it all. I’d take a fiendish delight in doing something like that right now. Good thing all the stores are closed. Gee, darling, I wish these 17 days would hurry. I love you so much. Honey, I really need you. You’re so essential to me. They should know better than to try to separate us. I’m just lost without you, darling. Well, maybe in about ten more days you’ll be back. Golly, darling, that’s a heck of a long time. There’s nothing we can do about it though, except wait. Tomorrow I won’t get a letter from you, honey, because you said you didn’t write last night. Oh well. Hope that you start receiving mine, honey, not that they’re anything to read but I know how much I look forward to your letters, honey. It’s just awful not to get one. Well, sweetheart, it’s not getting any earlier. That’s a brilliant statement. So I guess it’s way past my bedtime. Say hello to Tom + D. A. for me. If you get a stack of letters all at once you’re going to spend quite a while saying hello to Tom + D. A. for me. Oh, Julie + Betty Joe said hello from then (to you.) They’re sorry that we couldn’t be together, too. Not half as sorry as I am. Well, darling, only about ten more nights. I hope less and we’ll be together. Do you think you’ll be able to be together? It would really be awful if you had to go back every night. Well, again, goodnite [sic], honey. I miss you so. I love you so, Judd + hope we can be together again. You’ll always have all my love and devotion + I love you so. Your devoted wife (who is slightly lonesome) Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
