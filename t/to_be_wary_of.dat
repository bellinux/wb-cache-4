5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{reported}} that their security teams and law enforcement were investigating the possibility of Halo 4 content being leaked on the internet in October 2012. Jessica Shea, Community Manager at 343 Industries, warned fans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> Halo 4 spoilers that were posted on the internet. O'Connor stated at New York Comic Con that leaks {{of the game and}} footage would not have any impact on how the game is released or marketed and that unlicensed uploading of high-profile games is inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E

5|$|Chicago hosted Arizona in week two, the 92nd meeting all-time; the Bears, who {{possessed a}} 58–27–6 record against the Cardinals {{entering}} the game, won {{the most recent}} meeting in 2012 28–13, though Arizona won the last game at Soldier Field in 2009 41–21. The Bears faced a 3–4 defense {{for the second consecutive}} week, and the Cardinals had a blitz-heavy defense. To attack it, Jeff Joniak wrote Matt Forte would have to be utilized. When passing, the Bears had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> left-side cornerback Patrick Peterson; in 2014, Arizona's opponents only threw passes of at least ten yards to that side 29 times, the fifth-lowest in the NFL. As a result, teams attempted to throw ti the right, with 51 deep passes, though only 29.4 percent were completed, the sixth-lowest in the league. Defensively, the Bears had to provide pressure to Carson Palmer, who had excelled in the season opener against the Saints with a three-touchdown game, against a line that allowed no sacks in week one, while also focusing on challenging the speed of the Arizona receivers. lineman Ego Ferguson, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, Jon Bostic, Tayo Fabuluje were inactive for the game.|$|E
5|$|Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry {{describes}} unusual {{cases where}} deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley {{as a possible}} answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the coral snake, with unprofitability when the predator has {{an increased risk of}} death, negating any learned behaviour. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. This scenario is a little more difficult to understand, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry), is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic programming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.|$|E

25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human {{is to run}} away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from {{thousands of years ago}} when they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that they have come to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} {{first decade of}} the 21st century, {{conservative}} religious leaders in northern Nigeria, suspicious of Western medicine, advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine. The boycott was endorsed by the governor of Kano State, and immunization was suspended for several months. Subsequently, polio reappeared in a dozen formerly polio-free neighbors of Nigeria, and genetic tests showed the virus was the same one that originated in northern Nigeria. Nigeria had become a net exporter of the polio virus to its African neighbors. People in the northern states were also reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005. In 2006, Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide. Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in Borno State.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reasons were}} {{initially}} posited by media sources {{and family members}} for why Menezes may have run from police, as indicated by initial reports. A few weeks prior, he had been attacked by a gang and may have perceived {{that he was in}} a similar situation upon seeing plainclothes officers chasing him. Several sources have speculated that irregularities about his immigration status may have given him reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the police; evidence that emerged {{during the course of the}} criminal trial into the Health and Safety charge showed that Menezes was lawfully in the country on 22 July 2005. This is mentioned in the Stockwell One report, at footnote 4 on page 21. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a colleague believed that Menezes ran simply because he was late for his job. It was later indicated by the leaked IPCC documents that Menezes may have run across the platform to get a seat on the train, and did not know at the time that he was being watched or pursued.|$|E

When Liu Bei first enters Yi Province in the name of helping Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord, Zhang Lu, Zhang Ren and others warn Liu Zhang <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> Liu Bei and take precautionary measures, but Liu Zhang ignores them. When Liu Zhang attends a banquet hosted by Liu Bei, Liu Bei's strategist Pang Tong instructs the general Wei Yan to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to assassinate Liu Zhang. Zhang Ren senses danger so he draws his sword and pretends to join the sword dance while secretly protecting Liu Zhang from Wei Yan's advances. When war breaks out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, Zhang Ren sets up an ambush at the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, where his archers kill Pang Tong. After Zhang Ren is captured alive, Liu Bei asks him to surrender but he firmly refuses and is executed. Liu Bei feels it was a pity so he has Zhang Ren buried with full honours.|$|E

Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber, but when the real plumber arrives, Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) that Bianca called. He learns that Derek is dead, and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), so Bianca gives him her address. He visits Alice, who gives him the box that contained the phone number, which Alice says was found by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took £10,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, {{and he has no}} reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him £500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving.

25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

5000|$|Mangrove snapper is {{a common}} target for anglers, and is highly prized for its light and flaky flesh. It can be caught {{on a variety of}} baits, but is {{typically}} caught with live or frozen shrimp, squid, minnows and occasionally on artificial lures or baits. They can be spearfished, as well, but are sometimes a tough target, as they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> divers, rather than curious, and their wariness of baits and divers tends to increase as the fish grow larger. Most mangrove snapper are caught on light to medium tackle, and typical catches range from eight to 14 in long in shallow or in-shore waters, and up to 20 in long in deeper waters. Larger fish are uncommon, but not rare.|$|R
