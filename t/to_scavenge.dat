5|$|Killer whales {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} example was the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> {{meat from the}} whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Lions prefer <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> {{when the}} {{opportunity}} presents itself with carrion providing more than 50% of their diet. They scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress. In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} {{radishes}} can be pressed to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while {{not suitable for}} human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, {{can be used as}} a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.|$|E

50|$|With {{so little}} food they were reduced <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> <b>to</b> survive. Some {{were reduced to}} eating dogs and cats — and even rats and grass—anything they could obtain. Already {{underweight}} from years of prison rations, some were at half their pre-war body weight by the end.|$|R
50|$|The {{vernacular name}} water {{scavenger}} beetles {{is not an}} accurate description of their habit. With rare exceptions, the larvae are predatory while the adults may be vegetarians or predators in addition <b>to</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Many species are able to produce sounds.|$|R
5|$|After {{their water}} ran out, the Beck/Fiszer group {{developed}} a routine whereby {{some of the}} group worked to dig a well, while others watched out for approaching Germans, and yet others ventured outside the bunker <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> for useful items. The group eventually dug their way to two water canals and built a well. On November 17, during an excursion outside the bunker, the group made contact with a small partisan unit, also in hiding, led by a Russian soldier POW who had been liberated during the uprising. Subsequently, several of the group would join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further {{research needs to be}} done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E
5000|$|Several NSAIDs {{have been}} found to be harmful <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> birds. Diclofenac, carprofen, flunixin, {{ibuprofen}} and phenylbutazone were associated with mortality. Meloxicam has thus far been found to be [...] "Vulture-Safe" [...] and its use in veterinary treatment of livestock is being encouraged.|$|R
2500|$|To {{preclude}} the pollution of earth or fire (see Zam and Atar respectively), {{the bodies of}} the dead are placed atop a tower and so exposed to the sun and <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> birds. Thus, [...] "putrefaction with all its concomitant evils... is most effectually prevented." ...|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} Paleolithic, the {{increase}} in human population density, advances in blade and hunting technology, and climate change may have altered prey densities and made <b>scavenging</b> crucial <b>to</b> the survival of some wolf populations. Adaptations <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> such as tameness, small body size, and a decreased age of reproduction would reduce their hunting efficiency further, eventually leading <b>to</b> obligated <b>scavenging.</b> Whether these earliest dogs were simply human-commensal scavengers or they played some role as companions or hunters that hastened their spread is unknown.|$|R
5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally {{trapped in the}} seeps and became bait for predators that came <b>to</b> <b>scavenge,</b> but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey <b>to</b> <b>scavenge,</b> and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would have been happy <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E

These include the various approaches <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> oxygen and chlorine, either separately or simultaneously, from powder metallurgy (PM) titanium and titanium alloys during sintering. The {{ultimate goal is}} to enable the use of inexpensive titanium powders for the fabrication of low-cost, strong and ductile titanium and titanium alloys by PM routes...|$|R

50|$|This genus is {{omnivorous}} {{and prone}} <b>to</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The foods {{of choice for}} Vulpes consist of invertebrates, a variety of small vertebrates, grasses, and some angiosperms. The typical intake per day is about 1 kg. True foxes exhibit hoarding behavior or caching where they store away food for another day out of sight from other animals.|$|R
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> if it could.|$|E
5|$|The island {{they arrived}} on {{turned out to}} be {{uninhabited}} with little food and no apparent water. After a camp had been set up ashore, White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> supplies. He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use. Whilst there, he felt Judy in the darkness, pinned in her bed under a row of lockers. He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items, along with Judy, back to the island. The lack of water was becoming an issue, until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline. It took a couple of minutes, but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone's lives. During the first night, the magazine on the Grasshopper finally caught light and exploded, sinking the vessel. The survivors continued to camp on the beach for the following few days, with Judy protecting them from snakes.|$|E

50|$|Some {{techniques}} require pre-treatment of wastewater {{to ensure}} reliable performance, {{which could be}} potentially costly and technically demanding. For instance, presence of bicarbonate ions (HCO3−) can appreciably reduce the concentration of ·OH due <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> processes that yield H2O and a much less reactive species, ·CO3−. As a result, bicarbonate must be wiped out from the system or AOPs are compromised.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scavenging</b> <b>to</b> {{return for}} deposit glass and other {{material}} {{obtained from the}} blue boxes may be restricted by bylaws; the city of Toronto, for example, passed the Residential Collection By-Law 844-20-C <b>to</b> prohibit <b>scavenging</b> but the regulation is only rarely enforced and the practice remains prevalent throughout the downtown core.|$|R
5|$|While {{anchored}} off the Galápagos, Beebe and {{his crew}} noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, {{and set out to}} investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption, and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding it was filled with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava, or drawing too close to it in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> other animals that had died.|$|E
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to create this bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{remained}} by far {{the most}} important part of the English economy during the 12thand 13th centuries. There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas where grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead. In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures, whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket-making and peat-cutting. In some locations, such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich, salt manufacture was important, including production for the export market. Fishing became an important trade along the English coast, especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough, and the herring was a particularly popular catch; salted at the coast, it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe. Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period. Sheep were the most common farm animal in England during the period, their numbers doubling by the 14th century. Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool, particularly in the Welsh borders, Lincolnshire and the Pennines. Pigs remained popular on holdings because of their ability <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> for food. Oxen remained the primary plough animal, with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century. Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century and farmed for their meat in special warrens.|$|E

5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E
5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following <b>to</b> <b>scavenge</b> wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat <b>to</b> <b>scavenge,</b> being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} {{analysis}}, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|R
5000|$|After death, the {{skeletal}} remains suffered from prolonged transport, during which many bones were lost. Although [...] "Saltriosaurus" [...] was not aquatic, {{the environment in}} which the carcass was deposited was likely pelagic, judging by the associated ammonites. The locality is also rich in crinoids, gastropods, bivalves, brachiopods and bryozoans.(Lualdi, 1999) Deposition occurred on a slope between a shallow carbonate platform and a deeper basin. Various scratches, grooves, and striations indicate that the carcass was subject <b>to</b> <b>scavenging</b> by marine invertebrates.|$|R
