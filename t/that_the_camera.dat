5|$|The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{developed}} a battery-powered pigeon camera now {{on display in}} the CIA Museum's virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a failure.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E

50|$|When {{used with}} {{somewhat}} slow lenses they {{may reduce the}} effective aperture enough <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> autofocus system will no longer work; depending on <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> system, this may range from f/5.6 to f/8.|$|R
5|$|The {{graphics}} for the game's {{characters are}} cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> views them from, {{in order to}} recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E

25|$|The {{platform}} CCTV {{system is}} {{maintained by the}} Tube Lines consortium in charge of maintaining the Northern Line; the company made a statement to The Mail on Sunday insisting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were in working order. It was also reported that London Underground sources insisted that {{at least three of}} <b>the</b> four <b>cameras</b> trained on <b>the</b> Stockwell Tube platform were in full working order, and rejected suggestions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> had not been fitted with new tapes after police took away footage from the previous day, 21 July, when suspects in the failed bombings caught trains there.|$|R

5|$|When Lincoln finds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> has not {{detected}} any motion, {{the group}} sets {{out into the}} forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a hand grenade but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E

25|$|Annual sixes in Boston were {{discontinued}} in 1933, Detroit in 1936, and Chicago in 1948. The Six Days of New York hung {{on until}} 1950. There were some revivals but none succeeded.

5000|$|To fix the problem, Heller {{changed the}} format of <b>the</b> set so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> would remain stationary. He also placed {{moderator}} John Daly and the panel in different places so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entrances and exits would not look as awkward. In addition, before the third show, Heller requested an hour rehearsal for <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crew with mock panelists and contestants. <b>That</b> rehearsal gave <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operators a better [...] "feel" [...] for how the show should go.|$|R

500|$|In November 2006, the Crown Fountain {{became the}} focus of a public {{controversy}} when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased with a $52million Department of Homeland Security grant, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> augmented eight others covering all of Millennium Park. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but not Plensa himself. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> as inappropriate and a blight on the towers. [...] <b>The</b> city said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> would be replaced with permanent, less intrusive models in several months; it contended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> similar to those used throughout Chicago in high-crime areas and at traffic intersections, had been added largely for security reasons but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out LED lights on the fountain. The Chicago Tribune published an article on <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and <b>the</b> public reaction; <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were removed <b>the</b> next day, with Plensa's support.|$|R
25|$|Douglass {{considered}} photography {{very important}} in ending slavery and racism, and believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> would not lie, even {{in the hands of}} a racist white, photographs being an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. He tended to look directly into the camera to confront the viewer, with a stern look.|$|E
25|$|Between November 1963 and January 1964, the FBI {{examined}} {{a copy of}} the Zapruder film, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> recorded at 18.3 frames per second. It is not clear from the film itself when the first and second shots occurred. It is apparent that by frame 225 the President is reacting to his throat wound. However, no wound or blood is seen on either President Kennedy or Governor Connally prior to frame 313. The fatal shot to the President occurred at frame 313 with the visible effects of the head wound.|$|E
25|$|So far {{all points}} in the 3D world have been {{represented}} in a camera centered coordinate system, that is, a coordinate system which has its origin at the camera center (the location of the pinhole of a pinhole camera). In practice however, the 3D points may be represented in terms of coordinates relative to an arbitrary coordinate system (X1',X2',X3'). Assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> coordinate axes (X1,X2,X3) and the axes (X1',X2',X3') are of Euclidean type (orthogonal and isotropic), there is a unique Euclidean 3D transformation (rotation and translation) between the two coordinate systems. In other words, the camera is not necessarily at the origin looking along the z axis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> high-definition video <b>camera</b> used {{to inspect}} the shuttle from Kennedy Space Center during launch failed prior to liftoff.

25|$|Given {{the high}} level of public {{interest}} in the outcome of the trial, Scottish broadcaster STV wrote to the then Lord Justice General, Lord Hamilton, requesting permission to film the sentencing of Gilroy. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that the sentencing diet would be filmed by a camera crew from STV and the footage made freely available to broadcasters for use on the same day. Strict conditions were placed on what could be filmed. The Lord Justice General stipulated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> should focus solely on the trial judge and court staff and that Gilroy himself could not be filmed. In addition, it was reported that filming would only commence after Jack Davidson QC had finished delivering his plea in mitigation.|$|E
25|$|Editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were {{involved}} in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrone that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{about the}} {{gameplay}} was mixed. Many reviews complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was at times frustrating and the Gummi Ship portions {{were out of}} place. GameSpot cited [...] "tedious" [...] gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as [...] "pale imitations of the Star Fox series", but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights. Dengeki Online commented on the camera controls, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> would often run into objects while being rotated by the player. GamePro compared the battle system to [...] "old N64 Zelda games" [...] and had positive comments about Donald and Goofy's artificial intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> were {{employed}} as [...] "straight reportorial tools", Jack Gould {{observed in a}} New York Times review: [...] "It was the art of video improvisation wedded {{to the art of}} musical improvisation; the effect was an hour of enormously creative and fresh TV." ...|$|R

500|$|MediEvil: Resurrection {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. It received an aggregate score of 69% from GameRankings and {{a score of}} 66 from Metacritic. General criticisms from reviewers were directed at the camera controls, which was cited as being particularly poor during combat sequences, and occasionally being the cause for frame rate drops. Jason Allen of IGN noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> angles were [...] "not as bad" [...] during open areas of the game, but became [...] "rather clumsy {{in the middle of}} a heated battle". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer expressed similar concerns with the camera work, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was [...] "sloppy" [...] and that it proved particularly difficult during combat, when enemies were to suddenly appear off screen.|$|E
500|$|Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus {{models have}} an issue where the front facing camera is somehow [...] "shifted", {{or out of}} place. Apple stated that they would replace most iPhone 6s with this issue, free of charge. Despite {{numerous}} complaints regarding this issue, {{it does not seem}} to actually affect the camera itself. It is said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.|$|E
500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera." [...] Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.|$|E

50|$|Epipolar {{geometry}} is {{the geometry}} of stereo vision. When two cameras view a 3D scene from two distinct positions, {{there are a number}} of geometric relations between the 3D points and their projections onto <b>the</b> 2D images <b>that</b> lead to constraints between the image points. These relations are derived based on <b>the</b> assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> can be approximated by <b>the</b> pinhole <b>camera</b> model.|$|R
