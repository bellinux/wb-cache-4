5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east bank that {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|In Montenegro, Bond and Vesper {{meet their}} MI6 contact, René Mathis. Bond gains {{the upper hand}} {{at the start of}} the game. During a break, Obanno, infuriated, ambushes Le Chiffre in his suite. After Obanno leaves Le Chiffre's room, Bond engages him and {{strangles}} him to death. Vesper is traumatised by the encounter, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial stake, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to kill Le Chiffre when he meets Felix Leiter, a fellow player and CIA agent who is on the same mission as Bond. Leiter, on the verge of losing, agrees <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> Bond on the condition that the CIA takes custody of Le Chiffre after his defeat.|$|E

5|$|James Brooke {{started to}} rule Sarawak (present day Kuching) in 1841 after he {{obtained}} the territory from the Bruneian Empire. In 1853, Sarawak {{has expanded its}} territory to include the Sibu region. Sibu was a small village with several shop-houses. Such shophouses were built with atap roofs, wooden walls, and floors. The earliest inhabitants of Sibu were Melanau people, followed by Ibans, and Malay people in the 1850s. There {{used to be a}} Sibu Fort (Fort Brooke), which was built by Rajah Brooke in 1862. The fort was located at the present day Channel Road in Sibu. It served as an administrative centre for the Brookes in Sibu. However, it was demolished in 1936. It was common for the White Rajah to build such forts <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> his territorial claim as well as means of protection.|$|E
5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} one Test against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. <b>To</b> <b>stake</b> a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E

5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E
5|$|With the {{retirement}} of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition. No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55, {{so there was a}} full domestic season in 1953–54 for players <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, but was unable to maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings. He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership. Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris' XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris' XI won by 121 runs.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E

Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan waters that Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E
5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes {{did not wish to}} be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated. Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy. In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

5|$|Three {{straight}} draws {{followed in}} December, the first away to league leaders Aston Villa. United were fortunate {{to pick up}} a point given their opponents dominance in the second half, and were careless at Tottenham Hotspur, throwing away a 2–0 lead. Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, tugging on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on the cusp of stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane. Chelsea grabbed a creditable draw at Old Trafford <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> their championship credentials four days later and United, who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3–2; their last defeat of the season. On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam was {{in chaos}} after the Japanese invaded {{the country during}} World War II and {{displaced}} the French colonial administration. At {{the end of the}} war, the Japanese left the country and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime, was unable to exert control. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation. During this time, Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam. At the time, Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> a claim to national leadership, having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. Cẩn helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party) and the Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Diệm for support. On 23 October 1955, Diệm toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud-ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu. Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} more county {{fixtures}} before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew {{the first two}} before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Saggers played {{in all but the}} Nottinghamshire match. Against Lancashire, Saggers came in at 6/145 and held up his end, making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204. He then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as the hosts replied with 182 before the rain-affected match ended in a draw. Saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as Hampshire made 195 in their first innings. He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets (7/98) and was last man out for 17, one of only four players to pass five, as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead {{for the first time in}} the season. He then completed another stumping in the second innings and conceded four byes as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets. Saggers' final opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stake</b> a claim for Test selection was in the match against Sussex. He did not concede a bye and took a catch in the first innings. Saggers was not required to bat as Australia declared their innings closed at 5/549, and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as Australia won by an innings.|$|E
