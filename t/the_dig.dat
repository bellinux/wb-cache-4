5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left <b>the</b> <b>dig,</b> leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{the lease}} passed to Arthur Dorrien-Smith, {{who agreed to}} pass several {{properties}} on Tresco, including the castle, into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works. The castle was partially excavated in 1954, uncovering coins, pottery and a buckle. Parts of {{the first floor of}} the battery were reconstructed from the fallen stonework uncovered during <b>the</b> <b>dig.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E

50|$|Around 1860, the old Clapier castle was {{demolished}} {{along with}} the hamlet of Clapier. The Châtelus pit {{was connected to the}} old Clapier pit and 5th layer was explored but <b>the</b> <b>digging</b> of a new pit was required. <b>The</b> <b>digging</b> of a new pit named Châtelus 2 started in 1870.|$|R
50|$|Another legend {{was about}} Naga in the Mae Khong River. The Naga wanted {{to dig a}} ditch to create the new river. During that time, a dog was ordered to watch the {{entrance}} while <b>the</b> <b>digging</b> is in progress. <b>The</b> <b>digging</b> {{took a long time}} so the dog waited until it died.|$|R
5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. <b>The</b> <b>dig</b> discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} blacksmith shop on {{the site}} is long gone, however, in 1962 an archaeological team made of students from the University of Illinois approached the Deere Company about excavating {{the site where the}} shop once stood. The team unearthed the location of the original Deere Blacksmith Shop where the first successful steel plow was developed in 1837. <b>The</b> <b>dig</b> site is preserved beneath a building, known as the pavilion. The site is surrounded by museum exhibits which include artifacts, news clippings, and photographs.|$|E
5|$|The project {{gained the}} backing of several key partners—Leicester City Council, Leicester Promotions (responsible for tourist marketing), the University of Leicester, Leicester Cathedral, Darlow Smithson Productions (responsible for the planned TV show) and the Richard III Society. Funding for the initial phase of pre-excavation {{research}} came from the Richard III Society's bursary fund {{and members of the}} Looking for Richard project, with Leicester Promotions agreeing to pick up the £35,000 cost of <b>the</b> <b>dig.</b> The University of Leicester Archaeological Services—an independent body with offices at the university—was appointed as the project's archaeological contractor.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, Leicester City Council {{set up a}} {{temporary}} exhibition about Richard III in the city's medieval guildhall. The council announced it would create a permanent attraction and subsequently spent £850,000 to buy the freehold of St Martin's Place, formerly part of Leicester Grammar School, in Peacock Lane, {{across the road from}} the cathedral. The site adjoins the car park where the body was found, and overlies the chancel of Greyfriars Friary Church. It was converted into a £4.5 million visitor centre telling the story of Richard's life, death, burial and rediscovery, with artefacts from <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> including Philippa Langley's Wellington boots and the hard hat and high-visibility jacket worn by archaeologist Mathew Morris on the day he found Richard's skeleton. Visitors can see the grave site under a glass floor. The council anticipated that the visitor centre, which opened in July 2014, would attract 100,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, {{construction}} on a full-size {{model of a}} H. missouriensis was completed and placed {{on display at the}} museum. Jetton, then Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, sponsored a dinner event for state legislators to celebrate the completion of the exhibit on March 7, 2008. The two-year project was directed by Darrough, who was also in charge of excavations at the Chronister excavation site, and is the only permanent museum exhibit to feature the species. At the opening of the exhibit, Jetton mentioned that he hoped <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> site would become part of a state park one day. Currently, excavation is being conducted by the Missouri Ozark Dinosaur Project. The site has been covered to prevent water from flowing over dig material. The Chronister dig site near Glen Allen, currently under private ownership by Stinchcomb, is the only location in Missouri where dinosaur bones have been found.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a young Native American man {{is forced}} by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, {{and one of}} the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to {{describe}} his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in agony and dies. His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists. A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found; when Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) arrives to investigate, he notices similarities between both corpses. The archaeologist in charge of <b>the</b> <b>dig,</b> Liz Michaels (Amy Steel) is adamant that the site should stay intact for further excavation, but foreman Richard Powell (Garry Chalk) and his mostly Native American crew insist building must continue.|$|E

5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple who hate each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from <b>the</b> <b>Dig</b> 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|The helmet was {{discovered}} by 71-year-old Ken Wallace, a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist. He {{and other members of}} the Hallaton Fieldwork Group had found fragments of Roman pottery on a hill near Hallaton in 2000. He visited the site with a second-hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins, which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into the clay. He also found another artifact, which he left in the ground overnight. The following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear. He reported the find to Leicestershire's county archaeologist, who called in the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) to excavate the site. <b>The</b> <b>dig</b> took place in the spring of 2003.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians said <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> {{offered a}} clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E

5|$|After {{ending his}} work at Verulamium, Wheeler turned his {{attention}} to the late Iron Age hill-fort of Maiden Castle near to Dorchester, Dorset, where he excavated for four seasons from 1934 to 1937. Co-directed by Wheeler, Tessa, and the Curator of Dorset County Museum, Charles Drew, the project was carried out under the joint auspices of the Society of Antiquaries and the Dorset Field Club. With around 100 assistants each season, <b>the</b> <b>dig</b> constituted the largest excavation that had been conducted in Britain up to that point, with Wheeler organising weekly meetings with the press to inform them about any discoveries. His excavation report was published in 1943 as Maidan Castle, Dorset. The report's publication allowed further criticism to be voiced of Wheeler's approach and interpretations; in his review of the book, the archaeologist W. F. Grimes criticised the highly selective nature of the excavation, noting that Wheeler had not asked questions regarding the socio-economic issues of the community at Maidan Castle, aspects of past societies that had come to be of increasing interest to British archaeology. Over coming decades, as further excavations were carried out at the site and archaeologists developed a greater knowledge of Iron Age Britain, much of Wheeler's interpretation of the site and its development was shown to be wrong, in particular by the work of the archaeologist Niall Sharples.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} the Delta Labs, {{the marine}} is {{contacted}} by Betruger, who is now clearly shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth. If the marine did not send the distress call to Earth, Betruger does so himself, hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth. Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marine using the toxic gases in the base's recycling facilities. Upon arriving at the Delta Labs, the marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments, expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger's increasing obsession with the tests, as well as of an archaeological dig under the surface of Mars. <b>The</b> <b>dig</b> is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars, and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube. According to a scientist the marine finds alive in the labs, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell. The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal {{at the beginning of the}} game, depositing it in Hell. The marine pursues Betruger through the labs, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for <b>the</b> <b>dig.</b> The pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E
