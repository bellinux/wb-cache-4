5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> psychiatry. The first concerns the examination {{of psychiatry}} as a science, using the tools of <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science more broadly. The second entails {{the examination of the}} concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> mind and psychopathology.|$|E

First, to answer the {{question}} is it possible to speak about some kind of Kantian turn in the transition from <b>the</b> traditional <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science to <b>the</b> contemporary one. Second, and more important, to describe the main points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science just through the discussion of above question. The author is of the opinion {{that it is possible to}} speak about Kantian turn in <b>the</b> new <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science (<b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> which underlines <b>the</b> role of an a priori and conventional conceptual framework), but he also indicates certain important differences between Kantian original position and <b>the</b> new <b>philosophy</b> <b>of</b> science...|$|R
