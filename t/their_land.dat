5000|$|Highland Clearances: many landlords forcefully evicted their tenant {{farmers from}} <b>their</b> <b>lands,</b> {{in order to}} use <b>their</b> <b>lands</b> for more {{profitable}} businesses. This was a tragic event that created strong anti-landlord sentiments in the highlands.|$|R

5|$|The road, {{like with}} nearby Hanlon Creek, {{is named after}} Felix Hanlon, {{one of the men}} who cut the first tree in Guelph along with John Galt. He was one of the {{original}} settlers in the area, and his family eventually deeded <b>their</b> <b>land</b> to the city.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} loss of <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> local {{residents}} discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.|$|E

5|$|Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned {{substantial}} {{tracts of}} land in both the District and in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry items to the garrison at Fort Bayard.|$|E
5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|As {{metropolitan}} areas in South Florida began to grow, the Miccosukee {{branch of the}} Seminoles became {{closely associated with the}} Everglades, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving eco-tours of <b>their</b> <b>land.</b> As of 2008, there were six Seminole and Miccosukee reservations throughout Florida; they feature casino gaming that supports the tribe.|$|E

5|$|Before {{turning to}} the {{district}} court's rulings, we must acknowledge a certain awkwardness in deciding whether the Act encompasses the Tribe without considering {{at the same time}} whether the Act encompasses the controverted land transactions with Maine. Whether the Tribe is a tribe within the Act would best be decided, under ordinary circumstances, along with the Tribe's specific land claims, for the Act only speaks of tribes in the context of <b>their</b> <b>land</b> dealings.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering <b>their</b> <b>land</b> and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E
5|$|During Pryer's {{tenure of}} being the first {{resident}} of Sandakan, one of his first tasks was to establish law and order. But since the local natives, although cowed by the guns of the British Navy, considered the British as transgressors in <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> they were hostile towards the authority of the British North Borneo Company. Hence, Pryer had to import his police from India and Singapore. His first contingent of police was made up of Indian Sikhs with a large body stature. The Indian police were probably from the Sepoy Company in India and were generally called 'Sipai' by the locals.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} on {{and around the}} Mesa de Maya.

50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Spanish government, and later the American government, granted the Indians title to <b>their</b> <b>lands,</b> and had ordered all whites to move from <b>their</b> <b>lands,</b> a number of the Shawnee and Delaware slowly moved west before the advance of the whites, {{establishing}} communities further west in Missouri, in Stoddard and Greene counties.|$|R
5|$|Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE {{with the}} arrival from the middle Danube area of people, who kept livestock, {{cultivated}} crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools. <b>Their</b> <b>land</b> tilling predecessors had been coming into the Balkans and then the Danube region from Anatolia beginning a thousand years earlier. They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E
5|$|From c.1824 the {{movement}} of European colonists and their farming practices onto Pallittorre lands brought the two groups into often violent conflict. The conflict increased over time. In retaliation for acts by Europeans, killings of settlers by aborigines in 1827 {{appear to have been}} part of a coordinated effort to drive the settlers away. The conflict and violence was from both Europeans and aborigines, though more the former than latter. European disease, deliberate killings, forced exile to the islands of Bass Strait, and the driving of the natives from <b>their</b> <b>land</b> and food sources reduced their population. This reduction was such that during an 1834 visit George Augustus Robinson, Protector of Aborigines, could find only one woman in the area. There are only records of two colonists killed by the Pallittorre. The number of Pallittorre killed is not recorded; Shayne Breen—Lecturer in Aboriginal Studies at the University of Tasmania—has estimated more than one hundred. The removal of the Pallittorre from <b>their</b> <b>land,</b> a pattern echoed across Tasmania, was largely intentional. Deliberate policy, promulgated by Governor Arthur, was to remove the native population from the land and grant it to European settlers.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling <b>their</b> <b>land</b> piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of <b>their</b> <b>land.</b> In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E

After {{efforts by}} Overbeck to sell northern Borneo to the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy {{for use as}} a penal colony were unsuccessful, he withdrew in 1879.
