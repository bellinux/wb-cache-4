40|$|Abstract: X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{studies on}} the radioactive ore samples from various parts of Rajasthan and Haryana have revealed the presence of several uranium and other atomic mineral occurrences in the albitite belt of western India. The primary uranium minerals (PUMs) are uraninite and brannerite, whereas, the secondary uranium minerals (SUMs) show considerable speciations: phosphate, silicate, hydrous oxide hydrate, and vanadate. Multiple oxides (MOs) are davidite, fergusonite, aeschynite-(Y), microlite, samarskite, euxenite, betafite, and columbite-tantalite. The thorium minerals are huttonite, thorite, uranoan-thorite, <b>thorianite,</b> thorutite, and brabantite. The yttrium and REE-bearing minerals are xenotime, britholite, allanite, chevkinite, tritomite, and monazite. It is noted that the measured unit cell dimension (a 0) of the investigated uraninites ranges from 5. 4110 Å to 5. 4646 Å. The highest unit cell dimension (5. 4646 Å) represents a composition (or oxidation grade) of UO 2. 05, whereas, the lowest one (5. 4110 Å) corresponds to a composition of UO 2. 54. Furthermore, it is also apparent that, with increase in oxidation grade, there is a concomitant decrease in unit cell dimension. As most {{of the values of}} a o of uraninites from the albitite belt are high (> 5. 45 Å), it may be inferred that the overall temperature of formation of uraninites of the albitite belt was higher (ca. 400 °C).

40|$|International audienceThe local atomic {{structures}} around Th in polycrystalline <b>thorianite</b> (ThO(2)) and thorite (alpha-ThSiO(4)) {{have been}} measured using Th L(III) -edge XAFS spectroscopy from room temperature to 1500 degrees C. Up to 48 spectra {{have been collected}} using the energy-dispersive mode and the heat-loop technique. Asymmetry in the Th-O pair distribution function at all temperatures has been accounted for using several anharmonic models. When the best model is used (the analytic model from Crozier and coworkers), the XAFS-derived thermal expansion, alpha, of the Th-O bond (i. e., 10 (2) and 8 (2) x 10 (- 6) K(- 1) in crystalline ThO(2) and alpha-ThSiO(4), respectively) an consistent with theoretical predictions (8 x 10 (- 6) K(- 1), Hazen and Finger's law) and the previous results (9. 98 x 10 (- 6) K(- 1) at 1500 degrees C or 9. 67 x 10 (- 6) K(- 1) at the temperature ranges of 20 - 2000 degrees C) obtained by using X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques. In thorite, where two sets of individual Th-O distances occur (at 2. 37 and 2. 47 Angstrom), the longer bonds are found to expand the most {{as compared to the}} shorter ones, again in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Based on this model, the medium-range local structure is found to exert little influence on the Th-O bond thermal expansion with increasing temperature. Therefore, anharmonicity for the Th-O bond is found to depend basically on the coordination geometry around thorium. Then, the same anharmonic model can be used to model the evolution of the local structure around Th as a function of temperature in related-, but structurally more complex materials such as radiation damaged ceramics, glasses and melts for nuclear wastes.

40|$|The thorium and rare-earth element (Th-REE) deposit at Morro do Ferro formed under {{supergene}} lateritic weathering conditions. The {{ore body}} consists of shallow NW-SE elongated argillaceous lenses that extend {{from the top}} of the hill downwards along its south-eastern slope. The deposit is capped by a network of magnetite layers which protected the underlying highly weathered, argillaceous host rock from excessive erosion. The surrounding country rocks comprise a sequence of subvolcanic phonolite intrusions that have been strongly altered by hydrothermal and supergene processes. From petrological, mineralogical and geochemical studies, and mass balance calculations, it is inferred that the highly weathered host rock was originally carbonatitic in composition, initially enriched in Th and REEs compared to the surrounding silicate rocks. The intrusion of the carbonatite caused fenitic alteration in the surrounding phonolites, consisting of early potassic alteration followed by a vein-type Th-REE mineralization with associated fluorite, carbonate, pyrite and zircon. Subsequent weathering has completely decomposed the carbonatite forming a residual supergene enrichment of Th and REEs. Initial weathering of the carbonatite has created a chemical environment that might have been conductive to carbonate and phosphate complexing of the REEs in groundwaters. This may have appreciably restricted the dissolution of primary REE phases. Strongly oxidic weathering has resulted in a fractionation between Ce and the other light rare earth elements (LREEs). Ce 3 + is oxidized to Ce 4 + and retained together with Th by secondary mineral formation (cerianite, <b>thorianite),</b> and by adsorption on poorly crystalline iron- and aluminium-hydroxides. In contrast, the trivalent LREEs are retained to a lesser degree and are thus more available for secondary mineral formation (Nd-lanthanite) and adsorption at greater depths down the weathering column. Seasonally controlled fluctuations of recharge waters into the weathering column may help to explain the observed repetition of Th-Ce enriched zones underlain by trivalent LREE enriched zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of allanite-(Ce) in the Eocene Casto granite of Idaho to hydrothermal activity has been investigated. Unaltered, igneous allanite from the Casto pluton {{is characterized by}} a narrow range of compositional variation, with little or no zoning. A representative empirical formula, based on the composition of the least-altered grain, is: (REE 0. 83 Ca 1. 07 Th 0. 04 Mn 2 + 0. 06) (Ti 4 + 0. 11 Mg 2 + 0. 04 Fe 2 + 0. 99 Fe 3 + 0. 48 Al 1. 38) (Si 3. 00 O 12) (OH 0. 95 F 0. 05), where REE represents (La 0. 14 Ce 0. 41 Pr 0. 05 Nd 0. 17 Sm 0. 03 Y 0. 03). The small amount of observed compositional variation is consistent with the coupled substitutions Ca 2 + + Th 4 + $ 2 REE 3 + and REE 3 + + Fe 2 + + Mg 2 + $ Ca 2 + + Al 3 + + Fe 3 +. Slightly altered crystals exhibit a rim in which Th is enriched, and La and Ce are depleted. Increasing alteration lead to extensive corrosion and replacement of allanite by fluorite, a REE-, Th- and P-rich phase (probably monazite), and a Th-rich phase (probably <b>thorianite).</b> In spite of attack by fluoride-rich hydrothermal solutions, the REE and Th originally in allanite were not transported significant distances, but were redeposited locally as secondary phases. The lack of significant REE and Th transport is due to the availability of phosphorus, which allowed the REE to be fixed in a secondary phosphate phase, and the removal of fluoride as fluorite.

The sedimentary country rocks have been domed. Geochemical anomalies for Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, Th, V, Zn and Mo, based on a core-drilling programme, were found to outline a mineralized zone coinciding with the crater rim, especially on the western and southern sides. The rim rocks are volcanic breccias intimately mixed and veined by decomposed, silicified and ferruginized carbonatite and carbonatitic tuff. A large variety of very fine-grained minerals {{have been identified in}} a groundmass consisting mainly of goethite and chalcedony. The principal Nb ore mineral is niobian brookite occurring as microscopic disseminated grains of several morphological types. High-Nb (12 % Nb 2 O 5) and low-Nb (8 % Nb 2 O 5) brookites have been distinguished. Some of them contain inclusions of ilmenorutile. Delicate brookite crystal aggregates crystallized in situ. No discrete V and Zn minerals could be identified but Th occurs as <b>thorianite</b> and thorite, Zr occurs in eudialyte and an unidentified KNb silicate and Y occurs as xenotime. Nepheline and eudialyte are probably xenocrysts from an unexposed body of nepheline syenite. It is concluded that mineralization took place in three overlapping stages: 1. i) primary magmatic, with concentration of Nb, Zr, Th, V in both carbonatite and associated silicate rocks; 2. ii) mesothermal, with oxidation and introduction of Fe, Ti, REE, Mo and F; 3. iii) epithermal, with hydration and dissolution of carbonates, removal of Ca and Mg, redistribution of Y, Ti, Nb, Zn and deposition of Si, Ba, Mn and other mobile elements. The suggestion is made that the preservation and extent of the third stage, which may be linked to fumarolic activity, distinguishes the multi-element mineralization at Salpeterkop from other carbonatite complexes.

40|$|International audienceLow-temperature {{alteration}} of monazite is documented in three centimeter-sized monazite crystals from Norway (Arendal), Madagascar (Ambato), and Sri Lanka. The three crystals have different chemical compositions, especially in their U, Th, Y and Pb contents and have 208 Pb/ 232 Th ages ranging from 491 to 900 Ma. Optical microscope (OM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images and electron microprobe analyses (EPMA) show {{that all three}} preserve a similar patchy texture. This texture is interpreted as resulting from an alteration reaction in which unaltered monazite (Mnz 1) reacts to form a secondary, Th-U(Y) -depleted, high-Th/U, monazite (Mnz 2) accompanied by thorite/huttonite (ThSiO 4), <b>thorianite</b> (ThO 2) and xenotime (YPO 4), the proportions of which are dependent upon the initial composition of the monazite (Mnz 1). Images reveal variably intense internal fracturing, with cracks filled with Th-rich ± Fe-rich phases. Monazite-xenotime thermometry demonstrates that the pristine monazites (Mnz 1) interacted with a low-temperature fluid. The alteration process is interpreted to follow a mechanism of fluid-mediated coupled dissolution-precipitation. Chemical dating with the electron microprobe shows no Th-U-Pb age differences between primary and secondary monazites, except {{in the case of}} the Ambato monazite, in which altered domains yield older (750 Ma) apparent ages than the pristine Mnz 1 domains. U-Pb and Th-Pb isotope dating using LA-ICP-MS yields ages consistent with electron probe dates for pristine Mnz 1 zones. However, disturbance of these systems in the altered monazite domains leads to variable age results for these, depending on sample. In the case of Sri Lanka and Arendal, only 208 Pb/ 232 Th dates provide a reasonable estimate of the age of alteration, which are constrained to be 450 and 864 Ma, respectively. U/Pb systems are disturbed due to common Pb contamination (up to 40 %) and U fractionation relative to Th during alteration, responsible for depletion of U in altered monazites (and increase of Th/U). In contrast, for the Ambato monazite, both the U-Pb and Th-Pb systems were affected and yield inconsistent older dates for altered zones. This is attributed to significant common Pb contamination (up to 80 %), which affects all Pb isotopes and explains why electron probe ages are erroneous. Th-U-silicate contamination during measurement, resulting from the presence of a numerous nano-phases and nano-fractures filled with Th-U-silicates that are visible only under TEM, also contributes to the anomalously old ages for these disturbed (Mnz 2) domains. These results demonstrate the important role of radiation damage effects, in particular swelling-induced fracturing, and the essential role of porosity and cracks, which allow fluid (charged with elements) migration through monazite during low-temperature alteration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} {{biogeochemical}} and hydrological cycles in small experimental watersheds on silicate rocks, common for the Temperate Zone, {{has not yet}} been widely applied to the tropics, especially humid areas. This paper presents an updated database for a six-year period for the small experimental watershed of the Mengong brook in the humid tropics (Nsimi, South Cameroon). This watershed is developed on Precambrian granitoids (North Congo shield) and consists of two convexo-concave lateritic hills surrounding a large flat swamp covered by hydromorphic soils rich in upward organic matter. Mineralogical and geochemical investigations were carried out in the protolith, the saprolite, the hillside lateritic soils, and the swamp hydromorphic soils. Biomass chemical analyses were done for the representative species of the swamp vegetation. The groundwater was analysed from the parent rock/saprolite weathering front to the upper fringe in the hillside and swamp system. The chemistry of the wet atmospheric and throughfall deposits and the Mengong waters was monitored. In the Nsimi watershed the carbon transfer occurs primarily in an organic form and essentially as colloids produced by the slow biodegradation of the swamp organic matter. These organic colloids contribute significantly to the mobilization and transfer of Fe, Al, Zr, Ti, and Th in the uppermost first meter of the swamp regolith. When the organic colloid content is low (i. e., in the hillside groundwater), Th and Zr concentrations are extremely low (< 3 pmol/L, ICP-MS detection limits). Strongly insoluble secondary <b>thorianite</b> (ThO 2) and primary zircon (ZrSiO 4) crystals control their mobilization, respectively. This finding thus justifies the potential use of both these elements as inert elements for isoelement mass balance calculations pertaining to the hillside regolith. Chloride can not be used as a conservative tracer of hydrological processes and chemical weathering in this watershed. Biogenic recycling significantly influences the low-Cl input fluxes. Sodium is a good tracer of chemical weathering in the watershed. The sodium solute flux corrected from cyclic salt input was used to assess the chemical weathering rate. Even though low (2. 8 mm/kyr), the chemical weathering rate predominates over the mechanical weathering rate (1. 9 mm/kyr). Compared to the Rio Icacos watershed, the most studied tropical site, the chemical weathering fluxes of silica and sodium in the Mengong are 16 and 40 times lower, respectively. This is not only related to the protective role of the regolith, thick in both cases, but also to differences in the hydrological functioning. This is {{to be taken into account}} in the calculations of the carbon cycle balance for large surfaces like that of the tropical forest ecosystems on a stable shield at the global level...|$|E
