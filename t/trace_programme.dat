40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{computer}} generated images. The thesis {{begins with an}} overview of a generalised computer graphics system, including a brief survey of typical methods for generating photorealistic images. One such technique, ray tracing, is {{used as the basis}} for the work which follows. The overview section concludes with a statement of the aim which is to: Investigate the effective use of available processing power and effective utilisation of available memory by implementing a ray tracing programme which uses space subdivision, multiple processors and a distributed world model database. The problem formulation section describes the ray tracing principle and then introduces the main areas of study. The INMOS Transputer (a building block for concurrent systems) is used to implement the multiple process ray tracer. Space subdivision is achieved by repeated and regular subdivision of a world cube (which contains the scene to be ray traced) into named cubes, called octrees. The subdivision algorithm continues to subdivide space until no octree contains more than a specified number of objects, or until the practical limit of space subdivision is reached. The objects in the world model database are distributed in a round robin manner to the ray trace processes. During execution of the ray <b>trace</b> <b>programme,</b> information about each object is passed between processes by a message mechanism. The concurrent code for the transputer processes, written in OCCAM 2, was developed using timing diagrams and signal flow diagrams derived by analogy from digital electronics. Structure diagrams, modified to be consistent with OCCAM 2 processes, were derived from the timing diagrams and signal flow diagrams. These were used as a basis for the coding. The results show that space subdivision is an effective use of processor power because the number of trial intersections of rays with objects is dramatically reduced. In addition, distribution of the world model database avoids duplication of the database in the memory of each process and hence better utilisation of available memory is achieved. The programmes are supported by a menu driven interface (running on a PC AT) which enables the user to control the ray trace processes running on the transputer board housed in the PC...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) with a fibre geometry to concentrate the sunlight has been explored, {{by means of a}} theoretical comparison with the conventional at plate LSC and by simulating the optical efficiency with the ray <b>tracing</b> <b>programme</b> PVtrace. In addition clear sky diffuse and direct spectra have been modelled for London and their contribution to the photons collected have been compared. It is found that looking at the losses caused by reflection, host absorption and the escape cone in combination with the geometrical concentration G, the fibre is found to be 1. 5 times as efficient as the flat plate LSC when 0. 1 m- 1 host absorption, low doping and normal incident light is assumed. The simulation showed that, as the path length for absorbed photons to the edge is long, maximum re-absorption occurs, in fibres of 10 cm length and 1 mm radius. Increasing the length from that point, hardly affects the optical efficiency, while the geometrical concentration increases, resulting in a high concentrating potential. A coated fibre is found to be more efficient than a homogeneous doped fibre, because the trapping efficiency is higher when photons are emitted close to the surface in of a cylindrical LSC...|$|R

40|$|Afdeyu is an Eritrean village {{located about}} 30 km {{north of the}} country’s capital, Asmara, in the {{highlands}} of Eritrea. In 1984, CDE established a research station in Afdeyu to {{study the effects of}} different traditional and introduced soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies on soil erosion. The initial approach focused on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). Later on it was adapted according to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). For over 20 years, CDE has been running the Afdeyu research station together with the Ministry of Agriculture. Collaboration continued with the Eritrean Ministry of Agriculture after the country became independent in 1991. At present, CDE is still supporting the research unit based on a comprehensive backstopping mandate. Several parameters, mainly biophysical, have been measured continuously ever since the research station came into operation.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 -D) fluorescence microscopes, including conventional instruments {{with digital}} deblurring, confocal systems and two-photon excitation, all exhibit monochromatic and chromatic aberrations. A simple Gaussian {{model of the}} aberrated point spread function and optical field for each instrument illustrates spatial distortions and blurring and some unique attenuation effects in confocal and two-photon microscopy. These properties depend on {{the manner in which}} illumination and detection combine to give the overall microscope performance and highlight the importance of both optics and sample aberrations; the specimen must be considered as an optical component of the integrated imaging system. Axial focus distortion, from refractive index boundaries at the sample, can be accurately modelled by a geometric ray <b>tracing</b> <b>programme,</b> considering weighted components across the entire objective lens working NA. The modal z-focus error, rather than the average of all weighted rays, agrees closely with empirical measurements of axial focus position from test samples. This agreement is particularly close for confocal measurements when NA 4 weighting is used in the model calculations, but the situation is more complex for samples with non-planar refractive boundaries. Calibration of axial attenuation in a botanical sample, arising from the combination of optical sectioning with specimen-induced spatial distortions and blurring, is possible using an in situ fluorescence sea within a permeabilized preparation. Parametric descriptions of attenuation can be obtained through the guard cell complex of Commelina communis leaf epidermis. Improved images of the 3 -D morphology of stomatal guard cells are then obtained by digital correction of attenuation and spatial distortion.

DESIGN [...] Integration of data describing sexual behaviour in the general population, with data describing sexual behaviour and mixing among individuals infected with gonorrhoea. Use of these data in a simple mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of gonorrhoea infection. SETTING [...] The general population of London and a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic in west London. PARTICIPANT [...] These comprised 1520 men and women living in London who were randomly selected for the national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles and 2414 heterosexual men and women who presented to the GUM clinic with gonorrhoea. MAIN RESULTS [...] The relationship between sexual mixing among people with gonorrhoea and sexual mixing in the general population is derived mathematically. An empirical estimate of the sexual mixing matrix for the general population is presented. The results provide tentative evidence that individuals with high rates of acquisition of sexual partners preferentially select other individuals with high rates as partners (assortative mixing).

The possibility of estimating patterns of sexual mixing in the general population from information routinely collected in gonorrhoea contact <b>tracing</b> <b>programmes</b> is demonstrated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximately 110, 000 {{people in}} the United Kingdom are {{affected}} with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). At least 75 per cent are undiagnosed. Treatment with statins is effective but effective primary prevention requires early diagnosis. The best strategy to achieve this is unclear. This paper compares {{the costs and benefits}} over a 10 year period of two strategies found in our previous modelling: population screening of 16 -year-olds or tracing family members of affected patients. METHODS: Computer modelling of time-limited data was conducted. The number available for screening and the potential new cases in England and Wales aged 16 - 54 years were estimated. The costs (of screening and treatment) and benefits (deaths averted) that might be accrued over 10 years were assessed. RESULTS: Screening 16 -year-olds results in 470 new diagnoses, and over 10 subsequent years averts 11. 7 deaths at a cost of 6, 176, 648 pounds sterling, giving a cost per case identified and treated of 13, 141 pounds sterling (including a 10 year drug cost of 1, 584, 918 pounds sterling). By contrast, screening first-degree relatives of known uases results in 13, 248 new diagnoses, 560 deaths averted over 10 years, at a cost of 46, 430, 681 pounds sterling giving a cost per case identified and treated of 3, 505 pounds sterling (including 10 year drug cost of 44, 645, 760 pounds sterling). The cost per death averted would be 3, 187 pounds sterling. CONCLUSIONS: Although the two approaches appear similar in cost-effectiveness over a lifetime, the shorter-term (10 year) cost-effectiveness clearly favours family tracing. This represents good value for money compared with common medical interventions, and suggests that pilot FH family <b>tracing</b> <b>programmes</b> should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiology, diagnostics, and {{management}} of tuberculosis in domestic cattle and deer in New Zealand {{in the face of}} a wildlife reservoir BM Buddle*§, GW de Lisle†, JFT Griffin ‡ and SA Hutchings# The control of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and farmed deer inNew Zealand has been greatly influenced by the existence of a wildlife reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis infection, principally the Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The reduction in possum numbers in areas with endemic M. bovis infection through vigorous vector control operations has been a major contributor to the marked reduction in the number of infected cattle and farmed deer herds in the past two decades. Management of TB in cattle and farmed deer in New Zealand has involved a combination of vector control, regionalisation of diagnostic testing of cattle and deer herds, abattoir surveillance and movement control from vector risk areas. Accurate diagnosis of infected cattle and deer has been a crucial component in the control programme. As the control programme has evolved, test requirements have changed and new tests have been introduced or test interpretations modified. Subspecific strain typing of M. bovis isolates has proved to be a valuable component in the epidemiological investigation of herd breakdowns to identify whether the source of infection was domestic livestock or wildlife. New initiatives will include the use of improved models for analysing diagnostic test data and characterising disease outbreaks leading to faster elimination of infection from herds. The introduction of the National Animal Identification <b>Tracing</b> <b>programme</b> will allow better risk profiling of individual herds and more reliable tracing of animal movements. TB in cattle and farmed deer in New Zealand can only be controlled by eliminating the disease in both domestic livestock and the wildlife reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Ground-based {{coherent}} backscatter {{radar systems}} are extensively used to investigate small-scale dynamics in the earth's ionosphere and related geophysical process(es) in the magnetosphere. At high-latitudes, HF radars are used {{due to the}} requisite orthogonal condition with the earth's magnetic field lines. Because {{of the effect of}} ionospheric refraction on the ray paths, the exact path of the radar signal through the ionosphere is then unknown. In practice, it is important to locate the radar echo sources given the echo parameters, such as group path, elevation angle, and azimuth angle. Furthermore, radar observations consist of direct backscatter from the ground. An uncertainty arises due to the difficulty in separating true ground backscatter from ionospheric scatter which fulfils the radar criteria based on the measured Doppler velocity and spectral width.;These problems are investigated in this research using a three-dimensional ray <b>tracing</b> computer <b>programme,</b> Jones 3 D (Jones and Stephenson, 1975). Some problems in the Jones 3 D code have been identified and corrected whilst modifications to the code have been made to suit the purpose of this research work. All modelling work presented in this thesis is based on two HF radars, the Halley HF radar in Antarctica and the CUTLASS HF radar in Finland. For the best comparison with radar observations, realistic ionospheric conditions are used. In the case study for the Halley HF radar in Antarctica, it is found that the radar's main propagation mode is one-hop propagation, and that the radar scatter is mostly organised in ranges in the order of E- region scatter, F- region scatter, and ground scatter. The range-bin statistical analysis suggests that the radar criteria based on the measured Doppler velocity and special width are not sufficient, and that the measured range (group path) parameter is important and should be used in separating radar ionospheric echoes from ground backscatter...|$|R

40|$|This essay <b>traces</b> two {{research}} <b>programmes</b> {{in broad}} strokes. Both programmes {{start from the}} same observation — the behaviour of an ant (or termite) colony {{and the ability of}} the ant colony to act in a collective manner to achieve goals that the individual ant cannot. For one programme such behaviour is indicative of intelligence; for the other it is indicative of (collective) instinct. The primary intention of the essay is not to assess the claims of intelligence found, but to consider the rationale of the researchers involved in the two programmes for doing such research. It is observed that virtue in one programme is understanding (with the concomitant ability to explain — and, hence, teach), while the primary virtue in the other programme is the utility — and ultimately efficiency — that this may add to human problem solving skills. The two programmes used as illustration are Eugène Marais’s study of termites {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century and the emergence of artificial intelligence projects that are inspired by ant behaviour in the second half of the 20 th century. The essay suggests that the current emphasis of inquiry at tertiary education institutions embraces utility to the extent that it displaces pure insight — and hence the ability to explain and, ultimately, the ability to teach.

40|$|Through its work, the Institute of Development Studies Sexuality, Poverty and Law {{programme}} (SPLP) provides new evidence-based {{knowledge and}} policy options that support efforts to: (1) strengthen, through legal reform, {{the rights of}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and those marginalised because of their gender identity and sexuality; and (2) support LGBT people and those marginalised because of their sexuality to establish sustainable livelihoods. This in turn supports the production of risk-sensitive, practical approaches that can be implemented to achieve legal reform and tackle poverty among people marginalised due to their sexuality. To date, the SPLP has produced over 40 policy and research publications, two toolkits and one interactive map. Of these resources, the programme has worked with local and national activists and academics to generate 18 empirical studies to document the impact of discriminatory laws and policies on the lives and livelihoods of people marginalised {{on the basis of}} their gender identity and/or sexuality. These studies include five policy audits, six poverty case studies and seven legal case studies, and they draw on original research in South Africa, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Egypt, Brazil, India, Nepal, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan and Lebanon. This report is based on a meta-analysis of the 18 empirical studies. Through this analysis, we <b>traced</b> the <b>programme’s</b> overarching findings against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While global leaders maintain their commitment to the post- 2015 vision of more inclusive development and the dissolution of inequalities, the work conducted by the SPLP calls attention to context-specific experiences of persons whose sexual orientation or gender identity and expression (SOGIE) does not conform to societal norms, rendering them vulnerable to various dimensions of exclusion from development policies and resources. To highlight the importance of integrating diverse SOGIE representation within the SDGs, this report presents seven main themes that emerge from the SPLP data and maps these findings onto the contemporary SDG framework. Correlations between global development areas, national, context-specific policies and laws, and various facets of everyday discrimination conducted against persons with non-conforming SOGIE are examined in this report.

Methods We prospectively documented the diagnostic work-up of all new tuberculosis suspects until a diagnosis was reached. We used clinical audit forms to record each step chronologically. Data on the patient's gender, age, symptoms, examinations (types, dates, and results), and final diagnosis were collected. Results Information was recorded for 754 TB suspects; 43. 5 % of whom were lost during the diagnostic work-up in health centres, 0 % in lung clinics. Among the TB suspects who completed diagnostic work-ups, 51. 1 % and 100. 0 % were diagnosed without following the national TB diagnostic algorithm in health centres and lung clinics, respectively. However, the work-up in the health centres and lung clinics generally conformed to international standards for tuberculosis care (ISTC). Diagnostic delays were significantly longer in health centres compared to lung clinics. Conclusions The high rate of patients lost in health centres needs to be addressed through the implementation of TB suspect <b>tracing</b> and better <b>programme</b> supervision. The national TB algorithm needs to be revised and differentiated according to the level of care. </p...|$|R
40|$|Social {{transfer}} programmes {{in developing}} countries are designed to contribute to poverty reduction by increasing the income of the poor {{in order to ensure}} minimal living standards. In addition, social transfers provide a safety net for the vulnerable, who are typically not covered by contributory social security. The question of how effective such programmes are in achieving these aims {{has been the subject of}} numerous impact evaluations. However, the optimal design of such programmes is still unclear. Even less is known about whether the adoption and implementation of transfer programmes is really driven by poverty and neediness or whether other factors also have an influence. To investigate these and other research questions, we have developed a new data set entitled Non-Contributory Social Transfer Programmes (NSTP) in Developing Countries. One advantage of this data set is that it <b>traces</b> 186 non-contributory <b>programmes</b> from 101 countries back in time and presents them in panel form for the period up until 2015. The second advantage is that it contains all the details regarding the various programmes' designs as well as information on costs and coverage in a coded format and thus facilitates both comparative quantitative and in-depth qualitative analyses. While describing the data we discuss a number of examples of how the data set can be used to explore different issues related to social policies {{in developing countries}}. We present suggestive evidence that the adoption of social transfer programmes is not based only on pro-poor motives, but rather that social policy choices differ between political regimes...|$|R
