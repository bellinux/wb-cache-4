50|$|A {{zenith camera}} {{combines}} an optical lens (about 10-20 cm aperture) {{with a digital}} image sensor (CCD) in order to image stars near the zenith. Electronic levels (tilt sensors) serve {{as a means to}} point the lens towards zenith.Zenith cameras are generally mounted on a turnable platform to allow star images to be taken in two camera directions (two-face-measurement). Because zenith cameras are usually designed as non-tracking and non-scanning instruments, exposure times are kept short, at the order of few 0.1 s, yielding rather circular star images. Exposure epochs are mostly recorded by means of the timing-capability of GPS-receivers (<b>time-tagging).</b>|$|E
50|$|Metadata {{relating}} to archiving, indexing and cataloguing {{is an integral}} part of TML, since a TML data stream is designed to be self-contained and self-sufficient. Any information about the system, as well as information required to later parse and process the data, is captured in the TML system description. In addition to information about the system that produced the data, precise information about the data itself is captured. Data types, data sizes, ordering and arrangement, calibration information, units of measurement, precise <b>time-tagging</b> of individual groups of data, information about uncertainty, coordinate reference frames (where applicable) and physical phenomena {{relating to}} the data are among the details which are captured and retained. The TML system description therefore automatically tags all fields, which can later be stored in a registry for discovery.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} of a radiating source can be determined by <b>time-tagging</b> {{the arrival of the}} radiated signal at a network of spatially distributed sensors. The accuracy of this approach depends strongly on the particular <b>time-tagging</b> algorithm employed at each of the sensors. If different techniques are used across the network, then the time tags must be referenced to a common fiducial for maximum location accuracy. In this report we derive the time corrections needed to temporally align leading-edge, <b>time-tagging</b> techniques with peak-picking algorithms. We focus on broadband radio frequency (RF) sources, an ionospheric propagation channel, and narrowband receivers, but the final results can be generalized to apply to any source, propagation environment, and sensor. Our analytic results are checked against numerical simulations for a number of representative cases and agree with the specific leading-edge algorithm studied independently by Kim and Eng (1995) and Pongratz (2005 and 2007) ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{documents}} describe {{aspects of}} the continuing development of a multichannel, dual-mixer system for simultaneous characterization of the instabilities of multiple precise, low-noise oscillators. One of the oscillators would be deemed to be a reference oscillator, its frequency would be offset by an amount (100 Hz) {{much greater than the}} desired data rate, and each of the other oscillators would be compared with the frequency-offset signal by operation of a combination of hardware and software. A high-rate <b>time-tag</b> counter would collect zero-crossing times of the approximately equal 100 -Hz beat notes. The system would effect a combination of interpolation and averaging to process the time tags into low-rate phase residuals at the desired grid times.

The project uses advanced internetworking technology to collect data unobtrusively from multiple sensors located throughout the aircraft without the time and expense of installing new wires. The sensors are used to unobtrusively extract data from several Line Replaceable Units (LRU’s).

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the ultraviolet light curves of five Hot DQ white dwarfs recently observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These light curves were constructed by extracting the <b>time-tag</b> information from the FUV and NUV spectroscopic data. Single-color light curves were thus produced in 60 s time bins. The Fourier analysis of these data successfully recovers the main pulsation modes of the three stars previously known to be variable from ground-based observations. We also report the discovery of pulsations in another object, SDSS J 1153 + 0056, making it only the fifth member of the new class of variable Hot DQ stars, and the first pulsating white dwarf to be discovered from space-based observations. The relatively high amplitudes of the modes observed in the FUV [...] 2 to 4 times that observed in the optical [...] as well as the high fraction of stars variable in our sample suggest that most, if not all, Hot DQ white dwarfs might be pulsating at some level when observed at high enough sensitivity.

40|$|The current gamma-ray/neutron {{instrumentation}} {{development effort}} at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center aims {{to extend the}} use of active pulsed neutron interrogation techniques to probe the subsurface elemental composition of planetary bodies in situ. Previous NASA planetary science missions, that used neutron and/or gamma-ray spectroscopy instruments, have relied on neutrons produced from galactic cosmic rays. One of the distinguishing features of this effort is {{the inclusion of a}} high intensity 14. 1 MeV pulsed neutron generator synchronized with a custom data acquisition system to time each event relative to the pulse. With usually only one opportunity to collect data, it is difficult to set a priori time-gating windows to obtain the best possible results.

The resulting data set can be plotted as a function of time or energy using optimized analysis windows after the data are acquired. Time windows can now be chosen to produce energy spectra that yield the most statistically significant and accurate elemental composition results that can be derived from the complete data set.
