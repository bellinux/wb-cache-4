5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj.

25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E

500|$|In 2013's Gangster Squad, a crime thriller, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD {{officer who}} {{attempts}} to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid Love. Stone {{has said she}} hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film {{as an excuse for}} the cast [...] "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess." [...] Christy Lemire of the Boston Globe criticized Gosling's [...] "weird, whispery voice" [...] and his [...] "barely developed, one-note" [...] character. However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was [...] "a seductive power" [...] in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: [...] "But like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out." [...] In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentines Derek Cianfrance, Gosling portrayed Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family. The shoot was described by Gosling as [...] "the best experience I have ever had making a film." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times praised the performance: [...] "Mr. Gosling’s cool self-possession— the only thing he was allowed to display in “Drive”— is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability." [...] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: [...] "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he [...] "reprises his inexorable-loner routine". The film has grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: [...] "Break the Internet", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.

A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving.

The Gospel for this day tells us how He went and was alone in the wilderness with the wild beasts, and yet trusted in God, His Father and ours, to keep Him safe. How He went without food forty days and nights, and yet in His extreme hunger, refused to do the least self-willed or selfish thing to get Himself food. Is that no lesson, no message of hope for the poor man who is tempted by hunger to steal, or tempted by need to do a mean and selfish thing, to hear that the Lord Jesus Christ, who bore need and hunger far worse than his, understands all his temptations, and feels for him, and pities him, and has promised him God's Spirit to make him strong, as He himself was? ...|$|E
