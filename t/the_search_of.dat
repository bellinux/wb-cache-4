5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) {{and evolution}} strategies (ESs) are two widely used evolutionary algorithms. The main differences between GAs and ESs lie in their representations and variation operators, which result {{in very different}} search dynamics. In this paper, we compare <b>the</b> <b>search</b> dynamics <b>of</b> GAs and ESs theoretically using a theoretical framework for analyzing <b>the</b> <b>search</b> dynamics <b>of</b> evolution strategies proposed in this paper and a framework for genetic algorithms we suggested in [Oka 05]. Based on the theoretical analysis, interesting aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> dynamics <b>of</b> GAs and ESs for single objective optimization are revealed. As an extension, preliminary results on <b>the</b> <b>search</b> dynamics <b>of</b> GAs for multi-objective optimization are also presented. ...|$|R
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the night}} of 2/3 April 1946, there were several attacks on railway {{installations}} around the country. One at Yibna occurred {{at the same time}} as a patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion was entering the village. The patrol's leading two vehicles exploded mines that had been laid on a bridge, wounding three men. At daylight the tracks of around 30 men were found, and a section from the 8th Parachute Battalion eventually cornered 24 armed men. In the firefight that followed, 14 of them were wounded and the remainder surrendered, with no British casualties. On 29 June Operation Agatha started; the brigade had been rotated to cover the south of Palestine, and were to search for arms and arrest any members of the Palmach in Givat Brenner and No'ar Oved. On 22 July the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed, which was the catalyst for Operation Shark, the searching of every house and property in Tel Aviv. For this operation the brigade had all the divisional artillery and the 3rd The King's Own Hussars under their command. The brigade's next tasks were Operations Bream and Eel between 28 August and 4 September, which entailed <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> Dorot and Ruhama in the Negev. For the first time army dogs trained in metal detecting were used during the operations, and they located a large arms cache in both settlements.|$|E
