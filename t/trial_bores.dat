In {{order to provide}} adequate protection against flooding, {{the area in which}} the main building is constructed was raised to 7.92m (26 ft) ordnance datum by filling from borrow pits on site, but the coal store and cooling tower area remain at the original level of 4.87m (16 ft) ordnance datum. The nature of the sub-soil was investigated by <b>trial</b> <b>bores</b> and found to be good load bearing marl at depths between 4.26m and 12.19m (14 and 40 ft) below the existing ground level and overlain by sand and gravel strata on top of which lay clay or silt and top soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{accepted}} {{structure was}} designed on the cantilever principle {{to cross the}} river and its flats, a length of 2,424 feet, with fourteen spans; thirteen were to be 176 feet and one of 136 feet. It was stated {{that one of the}} advantages was that the movement caused by temperature variations would not impact on the appearance or function of the sewer, which would have a grade of 1 in 2,500, when compared to steel construction. The cantilevers were to be splayed, to take account of horizontal wind stresses. The pre-cast concrete pipes (ovoid to achieve maximum hydraulic efficiency), in 8 foot lengths, were to be built into the structure. <b>Trial</b> <b>bores</b> along the site of the aqueduct showed that rock existed from 5-40 feet below the surface. However, reinforced concrete piles were to be used to support the bases of the piers. The reinforcement throughout was to be of ordinary commercial steel rods, which were lapped rather than joined into continuous bars. The steel rods in the upper booms of the cantilevers were arranged in concentric rings around the longitudinal rods. The gaps between each cantilever section were to be spanned by a 40-foot girder section fixed at one end, but free to move at the other. An expansion joint was to be provided at each span, its design being similar to that of an ordinary ‘stuffing box’. A footpath, acting as a structural form, would be provided throughout the whole length of the structure. At the time of its completion it would be considered one of the finest concrete structures in Australia (Stone, 1920: 49-51).|$|E
50|$|The rather haphazardly chosen borders, though, held true for {{none too}} long. No sooner had the French Revolution reached full swing than it spilt {{over into the}} Palatinate in 1792. In the ﬁghting that followed, the French {{defeated}} the Austrian-Prussian alliance, and all sovereign boundaries on the Rhine’s left bank were swept away. The administration of the conquered areas was reorganized according to the French Revolutionary model. During the French occupation between 1801 and 1814, the village belonged to the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Neunkirchen am Potzberg, the Canton of Landstuhl, the Arrondissement of Deux Ponts (Zweibrücken) and the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). Under the Treaty of Paris (30 May 1814), the Palatinate passed to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The Landcommissariat of Kusel (as of 1862 the Bezirksamt of Kusel) consisted of the cantons of Kusel, Lauterecken and Wolfstein. Rutsweiler was grouped into this last canton and was administered by the Mayoralty of Neunkirchen until 1825, {{and then by the}} Mayoralty of Mühlbach from 1826 to 1853. After a petition in 1829, the municipality, together with Mühlbach and Bedesbach, was transferred out of the canton of Wolfstein on 1 January 1836 and into the canton of Kusel by reason of the better accessibility under this arrangement. Beginning in 1853 and until 1972, Rutsweiler belonged to the Mayoralty of either Godelhausen or Theisbergstegen. In 1845, the village got a schoolhouse. In 1899, it was given an upper ﬂoor and a belltower. Between 1893 and 1903, four <b>trial</b> <b>bores</b> were made on the Potzberg, two within Rutsweiler’s limits, by prospectors seeking coal. On 15 May 1908, the waterworks (a cistern and a watermain) were brought into service. Electric light came to the village in 1921. On Christmas Eve 1944, the village was bombed by the Allies; two civilian villagers were killed. On 19 March 1945, United States troops took Rutsweiler am Glan. After the Second World War, the memorial at the graveyard was dedicated in 1953. A new schoolhouse was dedicated on 24 November 1962. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Rutsweiler was grouped into the then newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan in 1972. Rutsweiler was granted arms in 1978. In 1986, Rutsweiler am Glan participated in the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”), winning second place at the district level.|$|E

60|$|Twenty crossed plants {{raised from}} {{the seeds of}} perfect flowers were to twenty self-fertilised plants, {{likewise}} raised from the seeds of perfect flowers, in height as 100 to 99. The experiment was repeated, with the sole difference that the plants were allowed to grow more crowded; and now the twenty-four tallest of the crossed plants were to the twenty-four tallest self-fertilised plants in height as 100 to 94, and in weight as 100 to 97. Moreover, {{a larger number of}} the crossed than of the self-fertilised plants grew to a moderate height. The above-mentioned twenty crossed plants were also grown in competition with twenty self-fertilised plants raised from the closed or cleistogene flowers, and their heights were as 100 to 94. Therefore {{had it not been for}} the first trial, in which the crossed plants were to the self-fertilised in height only as 100 to 99, this species might have been classed with those in which the crossed plants exceed the self-fertilised by above five per cent. On the other hand, the crossed plants in the second <b>trial</b> <b>bore</b> fewer capsules; and these contained fewer seeds, than did the self-fertilised plants, all the capsules having been produced by cleistogene flowers.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eighty-four male {{patients}} with uncomplicated gonorrhea were {{treated in a}} randomized double-blind trial using two drug regimens. The combinations used were co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim, 80 mg and sulfamethoxazole, 400 mg) and TMP-SDZ (sulfadiazine, 400 mg and trimethoprim, 80 mg). In 43 patients who received eight tablets of co-trimoxazole in a single dose the cure rate was 88 %. In the 46 patients who received a second dose of eight tablets 24 hours later the cure rate was 100 %. When TMP-SDZ was used according to the same schedule the respective cure rates were 85 % (41 patients) and 86 % (35 patients). It is suggested that the two-dose regimen with co-trimoxazole is very effective {{in the treatment of}} uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea in the male and that the single-dose regimen, although less effective, may well prove adequate in patients defaulting after the initial treatment. At the present time, and with our local conditions, this form of treatment should be reserved for patients sensitive to penicillin or whose infections are resistant to this agent. The attack rate for patients having an episode of gonorrhea in the 12 -month period immediately preceding the <b>trial</b> <b>bore</b> a direct relation to the outcome of therapy. It was highest (26 %) in the group with an unsatisfactory outcome and lowest(4. 3 %) in the group with the highest cure rate. No adverse toxic reactions to the drug were recorded...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} judge egocentric {{distance}} was assessed in {{two groups of}} six observers using a manual pointing task. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the extent to which blur-driven accommodation can provide information on target distance in the absence of any retinal cues to distance. Observers were extremely accurate when carrying out the pointing task in a ‘fullcue’ condition. In contrast, observers were extremely poor at carrying out the task when accommodation was the only distance cue available. Responses on individual <b>trials</b> <b>bore</b> little relationship to the actual target distance in any of the observers. On the other hand, accommodation weakly biased the mean responses in some observers. This bias appears to be due to the observers 2 ̆ 7 effective use of accommodation to determine whether the target presented in one trial was nearer or further away than the target presented in the previous trial. Accommodation therefore appears to provide ordinal information, although the distance signal may actually arise from accommodation-driven vergence. The poverty of accommodation as a source of metric information was highlighted in a second group of observers who all demonstrated a strong bias when perceiving distance in the presence of an initially ambiguous retinal cue. It is concluded that accommodation can act as a source of ordinal distance information in the absence of other cues to distance but the contribution of accommodation to normal distance perception in full-cue conditions is questioned...|$|R

Secondly, this analysis is extended to cutting <b>trials</b> in <b>boring,</b> cylindrical turning and face turning. Then, based on a mechanistic approach, a model is defined according to the previous results and the coefficients are identified thanks to cutting trials in real conditions.

40|$|A {{high-temperature}} deep-sea hydrothermal system {{related to}} dacitic arc-volcanism was drilled using a tethered, submarine rock-drill {{system as a}} part of the Archaean Park Project. The benthic multi-coring system (BMS) employed allowed for direct sampling of microorganisms, rocks and fluids beneath hydrothermal vents. The samples examined in this study were from sites APSK 05 and APSK 07 on the Suiyo Seamount of the Izu-Bonin Arc in the Pacific Ocean. Based on the vertical distribution of samples derived from this vigorous sub-vent environment, a model of deep-sea subterranean chemistry and biology was determined detailing optimal microbial activities. Deep-sea hydrothermal sub-vent core samples of dacitic arc-volcanism obtained at the Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin Arc, Western Pacific Ocean were analyzed for acid and alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activities. Useful biomarkers of acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymatic activities were positively correlated against each other and was greatest at the partial middle core sequences; ACP and ALP activities determined were as high as 5. 10 and 6. 80 nmol/min/g rock, respectively. Biochemical indicators of ACP and ALP were consistent with the origin of biogenic amino acids occupied in the sub-vent region and microbial cell number in the fluid. The significant enzymatic activities demonstrated in this study provides crucial evidence that sub-vent regions represent part of the previously unknown extreme-environment biosphere, extending the known subterranean habitable spaces of, for example, extremophilic microbes.

Now, although to draw water {{is not very}} good, Yet we all should rejoice to be hewers of Wood. I own it has often provoked me to mutter, That a rogue so obscure should make such a clutter; But ancient philosophers wisely remark, That old rotten wood will shine in the dark. The Heathens, we read, had gods made of wood, Who could do them no harm, if they did them no good; But this idol Wood may do us great evil, Their gods were of wood, but our Wood is the devil. To cut down fine wood is a very bad thing; And yet we all know much gold it will bring: Then, if cutting down wood brings money good store Our money to keep, let us cut down one more. [...] Now hear an old tale. There anciently stood (I forget in what church) an image of wood; Concerning this image, there went a prediction, It would burn a whole forest; nor was it a fiction. 'Twas cut into fagots and put to the flame, To burn an old friar, one Forest by name, My tale is a wise one, if well understood: Find you but the Friar; and I'll find the Wood. [...] I hear, among scholars {{there is a great}} doubt, From what kind of tree this Wood was hewn out, Teague made a good pun by a brogue in his speech: And said, [...] "By my shoul, he's the son of a BEECH." [...] Some call him a thorn, the curse of the nation, As thorns were design'd to be from the creation. Some think him cut out from the poisonous yew, Beneath whose ill shade no plant ever grew. Some say he’s a birch, a thought very odd; For none but a dunce would come under his rod. But I'll tell the secret; and pray do not blab: He is an old stump, cut out of a crab; And England has put this crab to a hard use, To cudgel our bones, and for drink give us ver-juice; And therefore his witnesses justly may boast, That none are more properly knights of the post, [...] But here Mr. Wood complains that we mock, Though he may be a blockhead, he's no real block. He can eat, drink, and sleep; now and then for a friend He'll not be too proud an old kettle to mend; He can lie like a courtier, and think it no scorn, When gold’s to be got, to forswear and suborn. He can rap his own raps[1] and has the true sapience, To turn a good penny to twenty bad halfpence. Then in spite of your sophistry, honest Will Wood Is a man of this world, all true flesh and blood; So you are but in jest, and you will not, I hope, Unman the poor knave {{for the sake of a}} trope. 'Tis a metaphor known to every plain thinker, Just as when we say, the devil's a tinker, Which cannot, in literal sense be made good, Unless by the devil we mean Mr. Wood. [...] But some will object that the devil oft spoke, In heathenish times, from the trunk of an oak; And since we must grant there never were known More heathenish times, than those of our own; Perhaps you will say, 'tis the devil that puts The words in Wood's mouth, or speaks from his guts: And then your old arguments still will return; Howe'er, let us try him, and see how he'll burn: You'll pardon me, sir, your cunning I smoke, But Wood, I assure you, is no heart of oak; And, instead of the devil, this son of perdition Hath join'd with himself two hags in commission. [...] I ne'er could endure my talent to smother: I told you one tale, and I'll tell you another. A joiner to fasten a saint in a niche, Bored a large auger-hole in the image's breech; But, finding the statue to make no complaint, He would ne'er be convinced it was a true saint.

I'll hold you a groat, when you wimble his bum, He'll bellow as loud as the de'il in a drum. From me, I declare you shall have no denial; And there can be no harm in making a trial: And when to the joy of your hearts he has roar'd, You may show him about for a new groaning board. [...] Now ask me a question. How came it to pass Wood got so much copper? He got it by brass; This brass was a dragon, (observe what I tell ye,) This dragon had gotten two sows in his belly; I know you will say this is all heathen Greek. I own it, and therefore I leave you to seek. [...] I often have seen two plays very good, Call'd Love in a Tub, and Love in a Wood; These comedies twain friend Wood will contrive On the scene of this land very soon to revive. First, Love in a Tub: Squire Wood has in store Strong tubs for his raps, two thousand and more; These raps he will honestly dig out with shovels, And sell them for gold, or he can't show his love else. Wood swears he will do it for Ireland's good, Then can you deny it is Love in a Wood? However, if critics find fault with the phrase, I hope you will own it is Love in a Maze: For when to express a friend's love you are willing, We never say more than your love is a million; But with honest Wood's love there is no contending, 'Tis fifty round millions of love and a mending. Then in his first love why should he be crost? I hope he will find that no love is lost. [...] Hear one story more, and then I will stop. I dreamt Wood was told he should die by a drop: So methought he resolved no liquor to taste, For fear the first drop might as well be his last. But dreams are like oracles; 'tis hard to explain 'em; For it proved that he died of a drop at Kilmainham.[3] I waked with delight; and not without hope, Very soon to see Wood drop down from a rope. How he, and how we at each other should grin! 'Tis kindness to hold a friend up by the chin. But soft! says the herald, I cannot agree; For metal on metal is false heraldry. Why that may be true; yet Wood upon Wood, I'll maintain with my life, is heraldry good.|$|R
