50|$|D. Passive Investments Passive {{investments}} {{are connected to}} neither the investing company’s strategy nor their operations. Thus, these investments do not help the investing company to actively advance their own business and can only provide financial returns. Essentially, passive {{investments are}} no different from <b>typical</b> <b>investments</b> whose financial returns are contingent on the volatility of the private equity market.

50|$|Equity Club Model - With equity clubs, the {{up-front payment}} can be {{considered}} an investment of sorts (or at least {{a reduction in the}} opportunity cost of making the up-front payment), subject to <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> risks. When exiting the club, the refund of that fee is adjusted to reflect changes to the value of the home portfolio or in the fee for new members. Various clubs have different ways of providing this benefit. Also, with an equity club, the members own the club's real estate portfolio, which provides additional security of the membership deposits.|$|E
5000|$|Change {{management}} has been embraced {{for its ability}} to deliver benefits by improving the affected system and thereby satisfying [...] "customer needs," [...] but has also been criticized for its potential to confuse and needlessly complicate change administration. In some cases, notably in the Information Technology domain, more funds and work are put into system maintenance (and change management) than into the initial creation of a system.

5000|$|He {{describes}} his investment strategy as being based on [...] "intensive research into stocks" [...] looking for fundamental and large market failures in valuation, typically based on underestimated or previously unreported failings {{in the business}} or market of a stock. He follows this research by committing to a (usually large) short-position which {{he is willing to}} hold for long period of time—almost the mirror image of Warren Buffett's reputed [...] "fundamentals+long stay" [...] investment strategy. Because of this model, his investments function more like those of a whistle-blower than most <b>typical</b> <b>investments.</b> Examples of this include short-selling companies such as Baldwin-United, and more recently Enron Corporation.|$|R

40|$|An {{online survey}} of {{production}} process related energy efficiency barriers, drivers and {{the decision-making process}} was carried out {{among a number of}} UK industrial sector stakeholders. Survey responses indicated that access to capital, regulatory uncertainty and long/uncertain paybacks are major barriers to energy efficiency investments in UK industry. Cost savings and long-term strategy were found to be primary drivers of energy efficiency. Average payback criterion for energy efficiency investments was about three years and was slightly higher than other <b>typical</b> <b>investments.</b> In companies where energy efficiency was strategically important, decision-making was found to be more integrated into the mainstream business process. Energy and environmental audits followed by external consultants and colleagues in the industry were viewed as the most credible sources of energy efficiency information, whereas energy companies were viewed with least credibility. Drawing from existing studies and inputs from industrial energy experts, this study presents a taxonomy of barriers, drivers and decision-making attributes for investigation of industrial energy efficiency from a firm-level perspective...|$|R

This paper proposes an algorithmic/analytical approach to address the issues of optimal utilization of the resources towards a feasible and profitable model. The economic sustainability of such a model is accomplished via Cobb-Douglas production function. The production model seeks to answer questions on maximal revenue given a set of budgetary constraints. The model suggests minimum investments needed to achieve target output.|$|E
40|$|Credit for {{investments}} that pay {{back in the}} medium to long term (three to five years or longer) is in short supply in rural areas. Credit unions and microfinance institutions (MFIs), which generally have better outreach than commercial banks in rural areas, typically provide only short-term credit. Credit available from informal sources (such as moneylenders, family, and friends) is usually both short term and too costly for investment financing.

40|$|Conventional wisdom, used {{to explain}} the value premium, is that greater {{operating}} leverage increases systematic risk and therefore leads to a higher expected rate of return earned by a firm's owners. This paper shows {{that the relationship between}} operating leverage and the expected return is actually non-monotonic when allowance is made for the option to abandon an unprofitable project: the expected return is an increasing function of operating leverage when the latter is low, but a decreasing function when it is high. This demonstrates the dangers in drawing inferences from models that ignore the flexibility embedded in <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> projects.

40|$|Using {{the method}} of {{agent-based}} computational finance, this paper designs ten experiments to examine the impacts of the index futures market, <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> strategies, and different trading mechanisms on the volatility of the Chinese stock market, {{taking into account the}} behavior of investors. We have the following results. First, the volatility of the stock market decreases with the index future market and cross-market arbitrageurs. Second, different investment strategies have different effects on stock market volatility. In many cases, both market-imitating and stop-loss strategies can increase stock market volatility. Third, the mechanism of price limits for the index futures market can help to stabilize the fluctuation of the stock market.

40|$|We {{approach}} {{the question of}} how moving to a dividend exemption system would affect the location incentives of U. S. corporations from three different angles. We start by comparing the U. S. allocation of foreign direct investment in manufacturing across low-tax versus high-tax jurisdictions with that of two major dividend exemption countries, Germany and Canada. The second section demonstrates how the effective tax rate on the <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> in a low-tax affiliate would change under a dividend exemption system. The final approach uses data from the tax returns of U. S. multinationals to gauge how location decisions will be affected. Taken together, the analysis provides no consistent or definitive evidence that location decisions would be significantly changed if dividends were to be exempt from U. S. corporate tax. territorial taxation; dividend exemption; international taxation; cost of capital; multinationals;...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the sunk cost effect and ambiguity in investment situations. Starting from the sensemaking approach and the decision dilemma theory, our hypothesis is that a sunk cost affected decision can be “constructively" rational in ambiguous environments in the sense that decision makers have the opportunity, through actions, to enact an environment that allows an effective utilization of their sunk costs. We called this attitude “constructive rationality”. We conducted an experiment (N = 353) in which we manipulated the degree of ambiguity of the <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> scenario proposed in the seminal work of Arkes and Blumer (n. 3 A), analyzed the willingness to continue in each scenario, and the driving forces behind positive responses. Our results demonstrate that ambiguity favors further commitment of resources allowing a constructive interpretation of the future.

40|$|We {{propose a}} reduced-form model where jumps-to-default are priced because they {{generate}} a market-wide jump in credit spreads. While this framework {{is consistent with}} a counterparty risk interpretation (e. g., Jarrow and Yu (2001)), it is most naturally interpreted as an updating of beliefs due to an unexpected event. Simple analytic solutions are obtained for the prices of risky debt regardless of the number of firms that share in the contagious response. As a special case, we show that the contagious response can be induced via a liquidity-shock, with no impact on actual default intensities. Empirically, we find that credit events of large firms generate a market wide increase in credit spreads and a significant ‘flight-to-quality ’ response in the Treasury market. A calibration argument suggests that the premium associated with jump-to-default risk for a <b>typical</b> <b>investment</b> grade firm has an upper bound of a few basis points per year, but that the risk premium for contagion-risk may be considerably larger...|$|E
40|$|Longer horizon {{returns are}} {{constructed}} from data on daily returns. Observed drawbacks to running a Lévy process are a sharp decrease in higher moments. Drawbacks to scaling are a constancy of higher moments. A strategy that combines some exposure to independent increments and some exposure to scaling is {{developed in the}} context of self decomposable daily return distributions. Estimations are conducted on 400 stocks and we report that a good strategy for constructing longer horizon returns can even be that of running as a Lévy process half the daily return while scaling the remainder at rate one half. A statistical analysis of data on daily returns can provide some assessment of the centered daily return distribution but many questions of 8 ̆ 5 nancial interest require a knowledge of distributional properties at a longer horizon like a week, a month, a quarter or even a year.

A <b>typical</b> forestry <b>investment</b> in the early 2000s involved an initial payment of $3000 for one-third of a hectare woodlot, yielding a $2900 tax deduction at that time. Returns on harvesting depended on many variables; Great Southern forecast that investors would recoup their original investment and a further return of between $1923 and $4569 per woodlot, however early schemes did not achieve these figures on the basis of the timber sales, with some resulting in woodchip sales of only around A$1500, half the value of what was originally invested. Investors received their returns when the product (usually woodchip) was harvested and sold.|$|R
