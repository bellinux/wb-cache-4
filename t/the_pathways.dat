5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates <b>the</b> <b>pathways</b> for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Hippo <b>pathway</b> is an {{important}} organ size control signaling network and the major regulatory mechanism of cell-contact inhibition. Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and Transcriptional co-Activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are its targets and terminal effectors: inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> promotes YAP/TAZ translocation to the nucleus, where they interact with Transcriptional Enhancer Associate Domain (TEAD) transcription factors and co-activate the expression of target genes, promoting cell proliferation. Defects in <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> can result in overgrowth phenotypes due to deregulation of stem-cell proliferation and apoptosis; members of <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> are directly involved in cancer development. The pharmacological regulation of <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> might be useful in cancer prevention, treatment and regenerative medicine applications; currently, a few compounds can selectively modulate <b>the</b> <b>pathway.</b> In this review, we present an overview of <b>the</b> Hippo <b>pathway,</b> <b>the</b> sequence and structural analysis of YAP/TAZ, the known pharmacological modulators of <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> and those targeting YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> RecOR <b>pathway</b> of RecA loading {{differs from}} <b>the</b> RecFOR <b>pathway</b> in several respects, most notably its {{molecular}} interaction requirements and its ideal DNA substrate. [...] Unlike <b>the</b> RecFOR <b>pathway,</b> <b>the</b> RecOR <b>pathway</b> requires {{an interaction between}} RecO and the C-terminus of SSBP. <b>The</b> RecOR <b>pathway</b> also does not need a ssDNA-dsDNA junction to begin loading RecA onto the 3' overhang, whereas <b>the</b> RecFOR <b>pathway</b> typically does to work efficiently. Thus, <b>the</b> RecOR <b>pathway</b> in most conditions is more efficient than <b>the</b> RecFOR <b>pathway</b> in loading RecA.|$|R

5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by <b>the</b> <b>pathways.</b> Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in <b>the</b> <b>pathways</b> in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and <b>the</b> <b>pathways</b> of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter {{in the south}}west of the US.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened <b>the</b> <b>pathways</b> to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a {{thousand}} years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Hippo <b>pathway</b> was {{discovered}} {{as a signal}} trans-duction pathway that regulates organ size in Drosophila melanogaster. It is composed of three components: cell surface upstream regulators including cell adhesion molecules and cell polarity complexes; a kinase cascade comprising two serine-threonine kinases with regulators and adaptors; and a downstream target, a transcription coactivator. The coactivator mediates the transcription of cell proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. <b>The</b> <b>pathway</b> negatively regulates <b>the</b> coactivator to restrict cell proliferation and to promote cell death. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> prevents tissue overgrowth and tumourigenesis. The framework of <b>the</b> <b>pathway</b> is con-served in mammals.
