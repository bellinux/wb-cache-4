40|$|Abstract Using {{physiological}} measures, concealed infor-mation can be validly assessed. Orienting {{theory has}} been proposed <b>to</b> account for <b>concealed</b> information testing. As orienting is characterized by heart rate deceleration, one would expect this type of heart rate response <b>to</b> <b>concealed</b> information. However, with some exceptions, an initial heart rate acceleration <b>to</b> <b>concealed</b> information is typically observed. In the present paper, we examine the role of verbalization to explain the mixed pattern of heart rate changes. Using a within-subjects design, 30 {{participants were asked to}} either remain silent or to give an overt verbal response (‘‘yes’’/’’no’’) <b>to</b> <b>concealed</b> autobiographical and control information. The results indicate that verbalization accounts for the initial heart rate acceleration. In line with the orienting theory, initial heart rate deceleration is observed when participants remained silent...|$|R

5000|$|The attack {{prompted}} {{calls to}} allow firearms on campuses in Ohio. State Representative Ron Maag made {{a proposal for}} the expansion of [...] "concealed carry locations".

The proposal was met with a mixed response, with proponents saying that students would feel safer with access <b>to</b> <b>concealed</b> firearms, and opponents arguing that the expansion of concealed carry locations is unnecessary and could even complicate law enforcement response.|$|R

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely.
