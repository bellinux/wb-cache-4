5|$|Disney {{was unsure}} whether {{to release the}} film in theaters or direct-to-video.

5|$|The {{record is}} known for the {{difficulty}} Priestess encountered in trying <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>it.</b> The band's extensive touring schedule for their previous album Hello Master consumed {{much of the time}} they would have used to write new material, and after they began doing so, they had disputes with RCA Records, their international distributor at the time, as to whether the new songs were acceptable. After the completion of the recording sessions, which were themselves problematic, RCA ultimately refused to release the album, fearing it was not commercial enough, but allowed the group <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>it</b> on another label.
