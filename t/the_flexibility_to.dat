5|$|Even {{though the}} Marine artillerymen of the 2nd Battalion, 13th Marines Regiment were {{supposed}} to support the Ngok Tavak garrison, their arrival created significant logistical issues for Captain White. Due to the poor condition of the road that connected Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức, {{where most of the}} ammunition was stocked, the Marines had to rely on transport aircraft to bring in ammunition supplies. However, due to high demand and scarce resources, the U.S. 1st Marine Aircraft Wing simply did not have <b>the</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>to</b> provide the support required by the soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Furthermore, only 31% of the Marines' heavy-lift aircraft was available for operations. The lack of logistical support was exemplified by {{the manner in which the}} 105mm howitzers were deployed; when the Marines arrived at Ngok Tavak, White ordered the Marine detachment to place their howitzers on a downhill position outside the camp's perimeter, as the hill-top position was still covered by trees, making the position of the howitzers a non-ideal location for security.|$|E

However, due to a delay in the production and delivery of these aircraft, IndiGo dry-leased a total of 22 used aircraft {{to cope with the}} demand. On 15 October 2014, IndiGo expressed its intention to order a further 250 A320neo aircraft worth US$25.7 billion at list prices. On 15 August 2015, IndiGo confirmed the order for 250 A320neo aircraft for $26.5 billion. The order also provides IndiGo <b>the</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>to</b> convert some A320neos to A321neos that can seat more passengers and fly on longer routes.

5|$|Diocletian's {{administrative}} reforms had {{the twin}} aims of ensuring political stability and providing the bureaucratic infrastructure needed {{to raise the}} recruits and supplies needed by the army. At the top, Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy. This divided the empire into two halves, East and West, each to be ruled by an Augustus (emperor). Each Augustus would in turn appoint a deputy called a Caesar, who would act both as his ruling partner (each Caesar was assigned {{a quarter of the}} empire) and designated successor. This four-man team would thus have <b>the</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>to</b> deal with multiple and simultaneous challenges as well as providing for a legitimate succession. The latter failed in its central aim, to prevent the disastrous civil wars caused by the multiple usurpations of the 3rd century. Indeed, the situation may have been made worse, by providing each pretender with a substantial comitatus to enforce his claim. Diocletian himself lived (in retirement) to see his successors fight each other for power. But the division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves, recognising both geographical and cultural realities, proved enduring: it was mostly retained during the 4th century and became permanent after 395.|$|E
