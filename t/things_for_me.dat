God's might shows in the bass voice and the dominant key of B-flat major.|$|E

500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E

[...] When asked if Silk still ties up the skates he said “I skate maybe {{once or twice a}} year for a charity event. [...] I can’t say I miss it. [...] I’m content. [...] I’m good friends with former teammates Jack O’Callahan and also with Jack Hughes and Ralph Cox, who were the last two cuts from the team that year.

2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet the hardest <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Romney {{was asked}} to return to Bain & Company, which was facing {{financial}} collapse. He was announced as its new CEO in January 1991 but drew only a symbolic salary of one dollar (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). His turnaround of Bain & Company {{has been identified as}} a primary example of Romney's turnaround talents from the business world, and Romney says there was no upside for him personally: [...] "There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and which employed a thousand people." [...] However, once Romney took up the challenge, his stake in success became enormous, and his reputation would have been diminished if Bain & Company went bankrupt. [...] He proceeded to apply the [...] "Bain way" [...] to Bain & Company itself.|$|E
2500|$|Impressed by her {{performance}} in Under the Skin, Woody Allen cast her in Sweet and Lowdown, {{a romantic comedy}} about a fictional jazz guitarist in the 1930s (played by Sean Penn) who regards himself as the second greatest guitarist in the world. Morton played Hattie, a mute laundress and the love interest of Penn's character. The film was released in September 1999, to wide critical acclaim and moderate success {{at the box office}} in the arthouse circuit. George Perry for BBC.com found her to be [...] "extraordinary" [...] as an [...] "adoring mute who suffers [...] She uses her eyes to convey meaning, reviving techniques of silent cinema". Morton earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role, which was especially notable, considering the fact that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film. During a 2007 interview with UK's The Guardian, she remarked that the awards recognition, particularly her Oscar nomination, meant [...] "incredible <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the [...] I'm grateful for that.

2500|$|On February 28, 2014, Kendrick Lamar first {{revealed}} the plans {{to release a}} follow-up to his second studio album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), during an interview with Billboard. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he was quoted as saying, [...] "Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'... It's a trip. That's {{something that will be}} a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses—I truly believe that." [...] In an interview with MTV, Lamar said: [...] "To Pimp a Caterpillar was the original name and they caught it because the abbreviation was Tupac, Tu-P-A-C. Me changing it to Butterfly, I just really wanted to show the brightness of life and the word 'pimp' has so much aggression and that represents several <b>things.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> it represents using my celebrity for good. Another reason is, not being pimped by the industry through my celebrity." [...] The album was at one point believed by many to be called Return of Enoch. Between the releases of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City and To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar traveled to South Africa. Touring the country — visiting historic sites such as Nelson Mandela's jail cell on Robben Island, heavily influenced the direction of the record.|$|E
