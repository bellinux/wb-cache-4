500|$|The filmmakers {{found that}} the most {{difficult}} aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation. Todd Edwards explained that [...] "it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> change in this shot. I {{have the time and}} the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale {{then made}} a return to smaller-scale projects: [...] "My {{experience}} is that I sort of {{stepped away from the}} independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do solely." [...] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles— it was [...] "assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers"—but that her action career [...] "kind of took off a little too much." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, McKenzie {{turned her}} {{attention}} increasingly to teaching other women about electricity and radio. She had observed the need over years of {{working in the field}} herself. In 1925, she told the Australian Woman's Mirror: [...] "here are such a lot of women experimenters [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> form a Women's Wireless Club.' In 1931 she told a Sunday Sun reporter that she wanted to see a course of lectures on domestic radio and electricity established in girls' schools and technical colleges. The following year she took matters into her own hands, opening a Women's Radio College on Phillip Street in 1932. She persuaded employers to take on some of her trainees, as one of them later recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if {{it is a question of}} wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

[...] Obama added that [...] "few have been ignored by Washington for as long as native Americans – the first Americans" [...] and that [...] "too often Washington has paid lip service to working with tribes while taking a one-size-fits-all approach" [...] and promised [...] "that will change when I am president".|$|E

2500|$|Russell {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. [...] He gained the support he needed to become a {{first-class}} cricketer from his father, John, at Stroud Cricket Club, and at Archway School. Two days before his fourteenth birthday, he saw a catch on television: McCosker, caught Knott, bowled Greig, at Headingley in 1977. Russell himself has commented: [...] "Low-down, one-handed, across first-slip. Brilliant. I thought then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to do}} that. That's where it started; that was the inspiration [...]" ...|$|E

Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think if they put themselves in the same predicament, and the fact that I have been at Liverpool for 12 years and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
