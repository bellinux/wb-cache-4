5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more <b>tents.</b> When this area was filled up, more people would set up <b>tents</b> along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E

5|$|To collect water, on 20 June, Bidar Bakht {{and his men}} headed towards Jajau {{without knowing}} that Bahadur Shah was camped there. He came across a village where he found a flowing stream of water. To inform Azam Shah, he sent his messenger, Iradat Khan, to him with the message. When he returned, he {{informed}} Bidar Bakht {{that he had seen}} Bahadur Shah's advance <b>tents.</b> Khan Alam Dakhvini and Munavvar Khan, who were in charge of the central wing of the troops, were dispatched to attack the <b>tents.</b> Azim-ush-Shan's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces. The attackers looted the <b>tents</b> and then set them on fire.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1873 and the 1874 camp meeting seasons, the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association {{added more}} <b>tents</b> to the campground, {{increasing}} their number to almost 200.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Tent</b> map is a discrete-time piecewise-affine I/O {{characteristic}} curve, {{which is}} used for chaos-based applications, such as true random number generation. However, <b>tent</b> map suffers from the inability to maintain the output state confined to the input range under noise and process variations. In this paper, we propose a modi-fied <b>tent</b> map, which is interchangeable with the <b>tent</b> map for practical applications. In the proposed modified <b>tent</b> map, the confinement problem is solved while maintaining the functionality of the <b>tent</b> map. We also demonstrate simulation results for the circuit implementation of the presented modified <b>tent</b> map for true random number generation. I...|$|R

5|$|The Yemeni Government {{declared}} a state of emergency for Socotra shortly after the storm's passage on 1November. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. Various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. Neighboring Oman sent 14cargo planes' worth of food totaling 270tons worth of goods. The planes mostly carried food, as well as blankets and <b>tents.</b> The United Arab Emirates also sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and <b>tents,</b> and 1,200barrels of food. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra. Due to damage to the island's main port, residents built a makeshift pathway to help distribution of aid.|$|E

50|$|A <b>tent</b> peg (or <b>tent</b> stake) is a spike, {{usually with}} a hook or {{hole on the}} top end, {{typically}} made from wood, metal, plastic, or composite material, pushed or driven into the ground for holding a <b>tent</b> to the ground, either directly by attaching to the <b>tent's</b> material, or by connecting to ropes attached to the <b>tent.</b> Traditionally, a <b>tent</b> peg is improvised from a section of a small tree branch, if possible with a small side branch cut off to leave a hook, driven into the ground narrower end first.|$|R
50|$|Families stay in {{the same}} <b>tent</b> each year and <b>tent</b> {{locations}} are often passed down through generations. The wait for a <b>tent</b> reservation {{is said to be}} years long.|$|R

5|$|When the Romans {{set up a}} {{temporary}} castra, two maniples (without their velites) were selected to pitch the <b>tents</b> of the headquarters and officers, and details were made for fatigue duty, to get wood and water, and to give food and water to the animals accompanying them. The rest of the men, excepting velites and officers, set up the <b>tents</b> of the soldiers. During this time the velites would guard {{the outside of the}} wall and the wall itself, {{while the rest of the}} troops would guard the interior. The watch, which was composed of eight men led by a decurion, ran from 6 am to 6 pm, and was divided into four shifts, each of three hours.|$|E
5|$|Aid {{workers from}} the {{domestic}} region began delivering supplies such as food, blankets, and <b>tents.</b> A dispatch of 101 relief helpers, 40 IRCS staff, and four people from the public relations department at ReliefWeb also assisted survivors.

5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer <b>tents</b> are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer <b>tents</b> were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{types of}} <b>tent</b> pegs {{are made from}} flat {{material}} pressed into a shallow [...] "V" [...] shape cross section. [...] This type of <b>tent</b> peg relies on the broadness of the section to not turn under tension.Tent peg types and styles may typically vary in length from 150mm to 490mm, and in thickness from 1.6 mm to 3.2 mm for flat section <b>tent</b> pegs and from 4 mm to 11.2 mm for wire rod <b>tent</b> pegs. Smaller wire <b>tent</b> pegs are also available, especially where weight is critical.Plastic <b>tent</b> pegs are typically very wide and longer than metal pegs, and are used for softer ground types, sand and light soils.Heavy duty <b>tent</b> pegs may be made from angle iron from 2.5mm to 5mm thick, and have the hook welded into the open side of the angle, meaning that the open angle faces the <b>tent,</b> bracing the open angle of the <b>tent</b> peg against the tension.|$|R

50|$|Tree {{planting}} crews {{often do}} not permanently reside in the areas where they work, thus much planting is based out of motels or bush camps. Bush camp accommodations usually consist of a mess <b>tent,</b> cook shack, dry goods <b>tent,</b> first aid <b>tent,</b> freshly dug outhouses, and a shower <b>tent</b> or trailer. Planters are responsible for bringing either a <b>tent</b> or car to sleep in. A camp also contains camp cooks and support staff.|$|R
5|$|Events {{included}} horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, {{fighting with}} swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Booths and <b>tents</b> were erected in which games such as chess and cards were played for small stakes, and abundant food was supplied {{for everyone who}} attended. A temporary wooden structure called Dover Castle was erected in a natural amphitheatre on what {{is now known as}} Dover's Hill, complete with small cannons that were fired to begin the events.|$|E
5|$|Festival-goers {{can stay}} at local B {{accommodation}} {{but most are}} not {{within walking distance of}} the festival.

5|$|Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request {{international}} assistance in post-storm recovery. By January10, a cargo plane carrying 65million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, <b>tents,</b> and one tonne of rice, {{were given to}} local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. Sanitary items were also distributed {{by the government to}} avoid an outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tent</b> pegs may be {{manufactured}} from steel rod or wire, pressed flat steel, aluminium section, titanium alloy, angle iron, plastic, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, or ABS plastic.
