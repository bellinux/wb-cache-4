40|$|The {{evidence}} is growing world wide that EHV level transients caused by fast switching devices are breaking down insulations in power circuit breakers and transformers. The normal substation {{devices such as}} capacitor coupled voltage transformers, potential transformers, and equipment bushings {{do a good job}} at power frequency, but all have significant limitations (resonant frequencies in the ratio versus frequency) for measuring transients with higher frequency content [5]. A measurement technique is under development at the Southern Company (SoCo) to determine the magnitude and characteristic shape of high voltage transients on the 230 kV and 500 kV bus in Georgia Power’s O’Hara Substation. This is in conjunction with the continuing on-line FRA (frequency response analysis) project on the 500 / 230 kV auto-transformer at the O’Hara Substation [1, 2, 3]. The same <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> source for the on-line FRA is used to calculate the magnitude and wave shape of the transients at the 230 and 500 kV transformer bushing inputs. A laboratory grade wide bandwidth voltage divider is erected in close proximity to the phase one 230 kV transformer bushing to validate the transient calculations from the FRA software. The de-convolution software is not yet complete to produce corrected time domain transient data from the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> information, but comparisons can be made from the raw time domain data. This paper shows a comparison of transients from the <b>bushing</b> <b>taps</b> and the wideband voltage divider. The paper also shows that transients of a relatively high frequency content are available on an EHV bus and these same transients travel through the windings to allow the on-line computation of a frequency response analysis (FRA) for the perspective winding.

40|$|Insulation defect {{detection}} in time ensures higher {{operational reliability}} of power system assets. Power transformers {{are the most}} critical unit of power systems both from economical and operational front. Hence it becomes necessary to have knowledge of the actual insulation condition of transformer to increase dependability of the system. The performance and ageing of the transformer insulation is mainly affected by Partial discharges (PD). Proper diagnosis in terms of amplitude and location of partial discharge in a power transformer enables us to predict well in advance, with much confidence, the defect in insulation system, which avoids large catastrophic failures. In this work a 20 kVA, 230 / 50 kV single phase core type transformer is used for evaluation of the transfer function-based partial discharge detection and location using modeling of the winding, using design data. The simulation of capturing on-line PD pulses across the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> capacitor is done for various tap positions. Standard PD source model is used to inject PD pulse signal at 10 tap locations in the winding and corresponding response signatures are captured at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> end (across 1000 pF). The equivalent high frequency model of the winding {{is derived from the}} design parameters using analytical calculations and simulations in packages such as MAGNET and ANSOFT. The test conditions are simulated using ORCAD- 9 and the results are evaluated for location accuracy using design parameter based PD monitoring method. ...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection is {{an important}} technique for assessing the health of high voltage power transformers. A partial discharge signal within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding first, then travel along the winding to the bushing core bar. The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its tap point. Previous published work [1] has shown that these high frequency components at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point can be detected using a suitable sensor and transmitted to remote digital equipment for on-line analysis. In a high voltage substation there is often excessive electrical noise which may corrupt any measured PD signal from the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point as the bushing acts as an antenna. If signal transmission is implemented using standard coaxial cables this can result in further corruption of the PD signal. The use of optical transmission techniques therefore has clear advantages not only through improved noise immunity {{but also because it}} realises electrical isolation and improved operator safety. This paper details the application of an electrooptic modulator to generate transmission signals over polarization maintaining optical fibre from the measurement point. The feasibility of this approach has been investigated using PD signals measured at the tap point of a 60 kV bushing, two different PD sources have been used and in both cases it was possible to detect PD activity above 40 pC...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{partial discharge}} (PD) propagation within a high voltage transformer winding. Location of PDs and magnitude estimation are important tools for both diagnosis and prognosis {{of the health}} of large transformers. In reality there is limited access and knowledge of a winding and consequently any practical method {{requires the use of}} estimation techniques. The approach taken in this thesis is by considering lumped circuit parameter models. Firstly, a lumped capacitive parameter model was considered and secondly a transmission line lumped parameter approach developed. A technique of split winding analysis is introduced for both types of model. The derivation of the capacitive network considers the source location of a PD by defining the PD signal propagation in two directions. At the source, the currents are equal in magnitude and are attenuated as they flow in each direction. This provides information for a fixed distribution model equation. Under transmission line lumped parameter models, split winding analysis explains the development of accumulated harmonic waveforms of the PD propagation signal towards the neutral and bushing tap-point. At the source, a D’Alembert solution is employed to estimate the oscillation level and found to be in very good agreement with measured data using rectangular wave signal injection. PD signal behaviour is then considered using a time varying boundary conditions model with a principle of superposition equation of source signal. Duhamel’s principle is employed to find a solution for any waveform applied to some point on the transformer winding. Under the influence of losses and distortion, an accumulated harmonic amplitude analysis from the Duhamel’s principle estimates the PD propagation level. For different injection points along the transformer winding, the measured PD level at the neutral and <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point caused by the accumulated harmonic amplitude reveals different patterns. As the PD injection point is altered from the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point to the neutral, the measured signals significantly change. This in turn contains information of the level of discharge signal at the source. From this analysis a technique based on minimum mean error (MME) calculation using the measurements at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> and neutral points can be used to identify the source location of PDs based on the analysis of accumulated harmonic amplitudes. With a known location, the information can then be used to estimate PD levels. As the actual charge transferred at the location of a partial discharge cannot be measured directly, by using the D’Alembert solution, the PD source level is found to have approximately twice the apparent magnitude. By using the predominantly capacitive model derived based on split current propagation, PD estimation at higher frequencies is also possible. As a result, an estimation of PD level can be estimated for measurement signals having bandwidth of up to 150 MHz. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} on-line monitoring for condenser type bushing of power transformer in order to detect a degradation of bushing and to provide the alarm before bushing failure. For the bushing degradation analysis, the capacitance and power factor of bushing internal insulation are on-line monitored and measured by installing the sensing device at the test <b>tap</b> of <b>bushing.</b> The changing of internal insulation capacitance leads to the change of voltage across tap capacitor and the change of leakage current through bushing insulation at the test tab. Such changes result in the change of power factor or phase angle of leakage current. Thus, the leakage current is additionally detected by installing the Hall Effect sensing device to observe the trend of bushing failure. A total of eight cases of both normal and degraded insulation are investigated. The internal insulation capacitance {{as well as the}} magnitude and phase angle of three phase leakage current were measured and compared with the commissioning value or observed the increasing trend to set the alarm level. In case of degraded bushing, the leakage currents changed and caused the summation of leakage current value to be greater than the standard value. Then the alarm is activated. This knowledge was used to develop the detection and decision making algorithms in LabVIEW program to determine the condition of transformer bushing...|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} of partial discharges {{in a power}} transformer can be determined based {{on the characteristics of}} the transfer function from the discharge source to the measuring terminal. Previous studies partially validated the technique using computer simulation and practical experiments based on a PD calibrator to represent a discharge signal. 'Real' discharges produced by insulation defect models were used to study how discharges propagate in an 11 kV plain-disc-type transformer winding: A corona model and a 'floating objects in oil' model produced discharge signals with different durations at various locations along the winding. Measurements were taken at the <b>tap</b> of the <b>bushing</b> capacitance through a conventional discharge detector. The signals were filtered, amplified and fed into a digital storage oscilloscope. The frequency spectra of the measured signals showed significant similarities irrespective of the type of discharge source. The characteristic of the transfer functions, i. e. the crests and troughs in the spectra, could be used for locating the source of the discharge. Energising the transformer increased the level of electric noise, which did affect the low frequency end of the spectra, but did not have any impact on the characteristics used for location...|$|R
40|$|A measurements-based {{electrical}} method for locating partial discharges (PD) in transformers {{is described in}} the paper. This location method relies on the series resonance frequencies of the signals produced at the transformer terminals by a discharge on the winding. Based on the equivalent circuit of plain disc type winding which consists of series inductance (L), series capacitance (K) and shunt capacitance to earth (C) of the winding, an analytical location algorithm is derived which gives {{the relationship between the}} location of a discharge and its terminal response's series resonance frequencies. LKC parameters of the equivalent circuit can be estimated using the series resonance frequencies of a calibration signal measured at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> during PD calibration. The PD location algorithm was tested on 11 kV transformer winding using signals produced by a discharge simulator and real discharges, and the results confirm its validity with a location accuracy of better than 10 % of the winding length. However, blind area where this location algorithm is not applicable does exist near the neutral of the winding and far away from the measuring terminal. Since this location algorithm uses the series resonance frequencies below 500 kHz, it can be implemented with conventional PD measuring circuitry and instruments to detect and locate discharges in power transformers...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of partial discharge (PD) measurement data obtained using radio frequency current transducers (RFCT) {{incorporated into the}} external earthing connections (i. e <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> points and neutral to earth connections) offers the possibility of on-line condition monitoring of large transformers. A method for locating PD sources in windings has been developed, based on {{analysis of}} differential equations that model the propagation of PD signals from the source to the measurement point. Analysis reveals that if the discharge at the source {{is assumed to be}} impulse-like, then the form of the response at the measurement points can be simulated as a function of source location along the winding. If all parameters of the winding are known then it is possible to model the response, however, in the field this is often not the case. So the method developed here uses information from the PD measurements themselves to estimate the unknown coefficients required to simulate the likely discharge currents. With these estimates it is then possible to compare PD measurement information with simulation data in order to identify the most likely location of a PD source. An experiment based on a section of high voltage winding has been used to produce PD measurement data and to validate the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Power {{transformer}} bushings {{are among}} the least reliable components in high voltage systems, therefore the knowledge of their wear condition {{is very important for}} a proper network management. The aim of this work is to study the limits of applicability of an on-line monitoring method for transformer bushings previously presented by the authors. The technique allows to continuously estimate the variation of the bushing capacitance and its dissipation factor, without requiring to disconnect the bushing itself from the network. The method is based on a high frequency impedance measurement at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap.</b> It is clear that its value is not only related to the bushing, but it also depends on the other substation devices. For this reason, it is vital to discriminate the variations of the parameters due to the bushing from those due {{to the rest of the}} components. In order to understand these dependencies and to evaluate the applicability of the monitoring method, a high-frequency equivalent model of the substation is required.

A localization approach based on the measurement of currents at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point and neutral to earth connection has been developed, with the assumption that different PD source locations will generate unique signal profiles in terms of the distribution of measured current energies with respect to both frequency and time. Therefore the technique presented is based on analysis of measured current energies associated with different frequencies. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data,whilst minimizing lost information in the original dataset.

40|$|Transformer {{failures}} {{are often}} related to bushings with oil-impregnated paper (OIP) insulation. There-fore a strong need for reliable condition assessment exists, but problems {{are to be}} solved: (1) Traditional diagnosis consists of C / tan δ measurements at the potential <b>tap</b> of the <b>bushing,</b> but relations between insulation conditions (e. g. moisture and ageing) and diagnostic quantities are uncer-tain. Tan δ at service temperatures is unknown (although possibly high and dangerous). A significant improvement is achieved by polarisation / depolarisation current measurements (PDC measurements), even at ambient temperatures. A new evaluation method is proposed, the so called charge difference method CDM. It allows calculation of d. c. conductivities very quickly within some minutes. (2) Laboratory tests on wetted OIP samples show the dependence of dielectric properties (ex-pressed by PDC) on temperature, moisture and oil conductivity. D. c. conductivity in OIP is strongly related to moisture content, and- to a smaller extent- to oil conductivity and ageing. Ageing mainly influences short term polarisation currents because of increased oil conductivity. (3) Strongly aged 420 kV OIP bushings could be identified with PDC analysis at room tempera-ture, {{although there was no}} indication of defects from C / tan δ values.

In particular, when the servicing involves very critical processes, a new interesting strategy is represented by the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).

In this paper a novel monitoring method is proposed. It allows the application of CBM techniques to one of the least reliable components in HV and MV systems: the transformer bushing. Starting from some theoretical and practical considerations, it will be shown {{that it is possible to}} measure the capacitance and the power factor of transformer bushing, without putting the plant out of order. It is known that these two parameters are particularly useful to schedule the maintenance activity. This goal can be achieved by superimposing a high frequency sinusoidal voltage between the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> and the ground.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{measurements are}} an important technique for assessing the health of power apparatus. Previous published research by the authors has shown that an electro-optic system {{can be used for}} PD measurement of oil-filled power transformers. A PD signal generated within an oil-filled power transformer may reach a winding and then travel along the winding to the bushing core bar. The bushing, acting like a capacitor, can transfer the high frequency components of the partial discharge signal to its earthed tap point. Therefore, an effective PD current measurement can be implemented at the <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> by using a radio frequency current transducer around the bushing-tap earth connection. In addition, the use of an optical transmission technique not only improves the electrical noise immunity and provides the possibility of remote measurement but also realizes electrical isolation and enhances safety for operators. However, the bushing core bar can act as an aerial and in addition noise induced by the electro-optic modulation system may influence overall measurement sensitivity. This paper reports on a machine learning technique, namely the use of a support vector machine (SVM), to improve the detection sensitivity of the system. Comparison between the signal extraction performances of a passive hardware filter and the SVM technique has been assessed.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) analysis, {{based on}} measurement data, assumes that PD signals propagate inside a transformer winding from the PD source to the measurement points. In this paper, signals are injected via an external connection into specific {{points along the}} winding of a transformer experimental model. The measurement data obtained using radio frequency current transducers (RFCT) connected to the external <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> and the neutral to earth connections are illustrative of the propagation of signals inside a transformer winding. Thus, this paper reports {{on the development of}} a simulation model based on a lumped parameter network approach and compares simulation results with experimental measurements of PD signal propagation inside a high voltage transformer winding model. The physical model is an interleaved disc type winding which consists of eight sections and is modeled as having internal winding series resistances (R), inductances (L), series capacitances (K) and shunt capacitances (Cg), the model also includes the effect of their mutual inductances. The parameters are calculated using analytical calculations based on geometrical dimensions and the winding is modeled using a commercially available mathematics package. The simulation creates PD signals {{at both ends of the}} winding i. e. at terminal 1 and terminal 8, which are grounded through a small capacitive and resistive element to represent the bushing end and neutral to earth connection respectively.

The <b>bushing</b> <b>tap</b> point of a large Auto-transformer has been highlighted as a possible point on which to attach PD sensing equipment and is utilized in this experiment. Artificial PD signals are injected into the HV electrode of the bushing itself and a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) is used to monitor the current between the tap-point and earth. The experimentally produced data was analyzed using two different signal processing algorithms and their classification performance compared. The signals produced by four different artificial PD sources (surface discharge in air, corona discharge in air, floating discharge in oil and internal discharge in oil) have been processed, then classified using two machine learning techniques, namely the support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN). The feature extraction algorithms involve performing wavelet packet analysis on the PD signals recorded over a single power cycle. The dimensionality of the data has been reduced by finding the first four moments of the probability density function (Mean, Standard deviation, Skew and Kurtosis) of the wavelet packet coefficients to produce a suitable feature vector.
