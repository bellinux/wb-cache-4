5|$|On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, {{who was at}} a {{restaurant}} with his wife, to inform him <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E

The refusal of the Taliban to comply resulted in the United States taking military action to achieve the president's demands, the action given the name Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} among educated respondents from Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad showed that 75% of them disapproved of the U.S. operation and 66% disbelieved <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{had been killed}} at the compound in Abbottabad.

25|$|Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei made a 95-minute {{documentary}} titled The Giant Buddhas (released in March 2006) on the statues, {{the international}} reactions to their destruction, and {{an overview of}} the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.. A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas {{and its impact on the}} global Buddhist community.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and {{coalition}} allies) invaded Afghanistan {{to oust the}} Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting airstrike campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, {{the capital city of}} Afghanistan, fell by mid-November. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) fought within that region. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> escaped into Pakistan during the battle.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the 9/11 Commission noted <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{was seen}} being congratulated {{on the day}} of the Khobar attack, and stated there were reports in the months {{preceding}} the attack that Bin Laden was seeking to facilitate a shipment of explosives to Saudi Arabia. According to the United States, classified evidence suggests that the government of Iran was the key sponsor of the incident, and several high-ranking members of their military may have been involved. A U.S. federal court speculated that the Khobar Towers bombing was authorized by Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran.|$|E

40|$|Betting on {{elections}} {{has been}} of interest to economists and political scientists for some time. We recently persuaded TradeSports to run experimental contingent betting markets, in which one bets on whether President Bush will be re-elected, conditional on other specified events occurring. Early results suggest that market participants strongly believe <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Ladens</b> capture would have a substantial effect on President Bushs electoral fortunes, and interestingly that the chance of his capture peaks just before the election. More generally, these markets suggest that issues outside the campaign - like {{the state of the}} economy, and progress on the war on terror - are the key factors in the forthcoming election. ...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{pipeline}} was {{to pass through}} Afghanistan, {{it was necessary to}} work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the Taliban, selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor Bridas Corporation, signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian Gazprom relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. The United States alleged <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, Mullah Omar, announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E

2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate <b>that</b> <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film.
