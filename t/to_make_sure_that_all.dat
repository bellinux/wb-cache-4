2500|$|When {{the random}} {{variable}} [...] is not discrete, but continuous, the argument still holds. This {{can be seen}} in one of two different ways.

[...] Here, one should note that such a category would have the Radon–Nikodym property, that is, the Radon–Nikodym theorem holds in this category. This includes the Hilbert spaces; these are square-integrable, and in the manipulations above, this is sufficient to safely replace to sum over squares by an integral over squares.|$|E

2500|$|Chair Entertainment's {{creative}} director Donald Mustard stated {{that much of}} Shadow Complex is based around the gameplay of Super Metroid, a game he considers [...] "the pinnacle of 2D game design". Much of their effort was in creating the Metroid-style of gameplay, a first for their company. The first month of development was spent having the team replaying the various Metroid games {{in order to establish}} the language and concepts of such games for development in order to expand on enjoyable sections while avoiding the mistakes of these games. Chair's design process started by drawing out the game's world on graph paper, using the concepts of tile-based games to craft out the world, despite the final game not being tile-based. This process set certain rules, such as how high the character may jump with the various upgrades or how far the character must run before a certain power would activate. They then played out the game on this paper map <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> parts of the game were possible to complete. Such a map was also used to help with the game's pacing, making sure that the player's interest in the game would remain despite the acquisition of more and more powerups.|$|E

The Flotilla set out from Helgoland for Flanders on 22 January, but decoding of German radio signals by Room 40 warned the British of the German intentions, and the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers sent to intercept the German torpedo boats. The British set six light cruisers, two flotilla leaders and sixteen destroyers to intercept the eleven German ships, deploying them in several groups <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> possible routes were covered. At about 03:45 hr CET (02:45 hr GMT) {{on the night of}} 22/23 January, the 6th Flotilla encountered three British light cruisers ( [...] , [...] and [...] ) east of the North Hinder light ship. V69, leader of the German flotilla, attempted a torpedo attack against the British cruisers, but was hit by British shells, jamming her rudder, which caused V69 to collide with , badly damaging both ships, although both survived. The flotilla managed to break contact under the cover of smoke screens, but S50 lost contact {{with the rest of the}} Flotilla.

The recruitment of personnel below officer rank is conducted through All India Selection Tests and Recruitment Rallies. All India Selection Tests are conducted among 15 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct functional control of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands. Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, {{on the basis of their}} performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman. Some MWOs and WOs are granted honorary commission in the last year of their service as an honorary Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant before retiring from the service.|$|E
