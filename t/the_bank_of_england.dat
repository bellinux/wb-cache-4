This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.|$|E

5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>England</b> Act 1998 the Bank's Governor must {{write an}} open letter of {{explanation}} to the Chancellor of the Exchequer if inflation exceeds the target {{by more than one}} percentage point in either direction, and once every three months thereafter until prices are back within the allowed range.
