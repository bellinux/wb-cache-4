5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin.

2500|$|The {{swing and}} row simply {{consists}} of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> bringing <b>the</b> top arm down to the hips, while {{trying to keep the}} trail leg straight to store more potential energy into <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> <b>the</b> rowing motion also keeps <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> bent {{for a longer period of}} time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a [...] "U" [...] shape the left arm hugs <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> tight to efficiently use the recoil within <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> <b>The</b> goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be [...] "ejected" [...] off <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> <b>The</b> swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> close to <b>the</b> chest; from there the vaulter shoots their legs up over the cross bar while keeping <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> close.|$|R

5|$|The {{battle was}} a success for <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> at both the {{tactical}} level (the battle of Radzymin itself) and the strategic level (its role {{in the battle of}} Warsaw).

5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at <b>the</b> <b>poles</b> {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at <b>the</b> <b>poles.</b> This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between <b>the</b> <b>poles</b> and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from <b>the</b> <b>poles,</b> this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|In May 1409 an {{uprising}} in Teutonic-held Samogitia started. Lithuania supported {{it and the}} knights threatened to invade. Poland announced its support for the Lithuanian cause and threatened to invade Prussia in return. As Prussian troops evacuated Samogitia, Teutonic Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on 6 August 1409. The Knights hoped to defeat Poland and Lithuania separately, and began by invading Greater Poland and Kuyavia, catching <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> by surprise. The Knights burned the castle at Dobrin (Dobrzyń nad Wisłą), captured Bobrowniki after a 14-day siege, conquered Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) and sacked several towns. <b>The</b> <b>Poles</b> organized counterattacks and recaptured Bydgoszcz. The Samogitians attacked Memel (Klaipėda). However, neither side {{was ready for a}} full-scale war.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of fluid flow and fluid force of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> standing in scour were investigated with several different scour depths conditions {{by using a}} wind tunnel. The scour was modeled into a mortar, with an inverted circular cone. The diameter of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> was 40 mm and the scour depth was changed from H / D (= depth / diameter of <b>the</b> <b>pole)</b> 0. 25 to 1. 75. The free stream velocity was 16 m / s, making the Reynolds number 4. 2 × 104. Flow visualization was carried out using a surface oil-film method and smoke-wire method. The surface pressure distributions on <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> and <b>the</b> scour were measured and the drag coefficient acting on <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> was determined by integrating the surface pressure distribution on <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> <b>The</b> {{characteristics of}} the flow around <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> and <b>the</b> drag acting on <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> standing on <b>the</b> scour were clarified. The results show that as the scour depth become deep, the flow around <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> is extremely characteristic and the drag coefficient has a maximum value at Z / D = 0. 25 and a minimum value at about the midpoint between the ground level and {{the bottom of the}} scour...|$|R

5|$|Most mysticetes reside at <b>the</b> <b>poles.</b> So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds.

With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to <b>the</b> <b>poles</b> in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E
5|$|Near Tczew, {{with about}} 7,800 men—including 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth's elite heavy cavalry—Koniecpolski {{tried to stop}} the Swedish army from {{reaching}} Danzig.

The Swedes wanted to provoke <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. The Swedes then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept high by Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and the Swedes retreated.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August, {{with his}} forces encircled, Model {{organised}} {{attacks on the}} Polish position from {{both within and outside}} the pocket. The Germans managed to isolate the ridge and force open a narrow escape corridor. Lacking the fighting power to close the corridor, <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> nevertheless directed constant and accurate artillery fire on German units retreating from the pocket, causing heavy casualties. Exasperated, the Germans launched fierce attacks throughout 20 August which inflicted losses on Hill 262's entrenched defenders. Exhausted and dangerously low on ammunition, <b>the</b> <b>Poles</b> managed to retain their foothold on the ridge. The following day, less intense attacks continued until midday, when the last German effort to overrun the position was defeated at close quarters. <b>The</b> <b>Poles</b> were relieved by the Canadian Grenadier Guards shortly after noon; their dogged stand had ensured the closure of the Falaise pocket and the collapse of the German position in Normandy.|$|E
50|$|His {{development}} and {{mastery of the}} Petrov/Bubka technical model is also considered a key to his success. (A technical model is a sequence of positions and pressures which describe the method and style form of <b>pole</b> vaulting.) <b>The</b> Petrov/Bubka model is considered superior to many others today, because it allows the vaulter to continuously put energy into <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> while rising towards the bar. Most conventional models focus on creating maximum bend in <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> before leaving <b>the</b> ground, by planting <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> heavily on <b>the</b> landing pad. The Petrov/Bubka model follows the technique used by Kjell Isaksson, which concentrates on driving <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> up, rather than bending it while planting it on the landing pad, combined with high running speed. While the traditional models depended on the recoil by bending <b>the</b> <b>pole,</b> <b>the</b> Petrov/Bubka model may exploit the recoil of <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> and exert more energy on <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> during <b>the</b> swinging action.|$|R
