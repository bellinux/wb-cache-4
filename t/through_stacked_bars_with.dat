40|$|The linked micromap {{graphical}} design uses {{color to}} link each geographic units name with its statistical graphic elements and map location across columns {{in a single}} row. Perceptual grouping of these rows into smaller chunks of data facilitates local focus and visual queries. Sorting the geographic units (the rows) in different ways can reveal patterns in the statistics, in the maps, and in the association between them. This design supports both exploration and communication in a multivariate geospatial context. This paper describes micromapST, an R package that implements the linked micromap graphical design specifically formatted for US state data, a common geographic unit used to display geographic patterns of health and other factors within the US. This package creates a graphic for the 51 geographic units (50 states plus DC) that fits on a single page, with states comprising the rows and state names, graphs and maps the columns. The graphical element for each state/column combination may represent a single statistical value, e. g., by a dot or horizontal <b>bar,</b> <b>with</b> or without an uncertainty measure. The distribution of values within each state, e. g., for counties, may be displayed by a boxplot. Two values per state may be represented by an arrow indicating the change in values, e. g., between two time points, or a scatter plot of the paired data. Categorical counts may be displayed as horizontal <b>stacked</b> <b>bars,</b> <b>with</b> optional standardization to percents or centering of the bars. Layout options include specification of the sort order for the rows, the graph/map linking colors, a vertical reference line and others. Output may be directed to the screen but is best displayed on a printer (or as a print image saved to any file format supported by R). The availability of a pre-defined linked micromap layout specifically for the 51 US states with graphical displays of single values, data distributions, change between two values, scatter plots of paired values, time series data and categorical data, facilitates quick exploration and communication of US state data for most common data types...|$|R
40|$|Infiltration and {{solidification}} processing {{has been}} studied to produce selectively-reinforced metal-matrix composites. It has been observed that when the spacing between reinforcement phases in the preforms is small enough, the microstructure of the metal is modified and microsegregation reduced due to the constraint of the reinforcement phase. Different aspects of the constrained solidification have been studied experimentally and numerically, but the mechanisms for the change of microstructure and microsegregation are not fully understood. ^ In order to study {{the effect of the}} reinforcement on dendritic solidification, a 2 -D cellular automaton for solid-liquid phase change coupled with finite volume calculation of heat and mass diffusion is developed. The behavior of the model with various numerical parameters, such as time step and grid size, is studied and an operation window for producing reliable results is found. ^ Constrained solidification through preforms of parallel planar channels and <b>stacked</b> <b>bars</b> <b>with</b> various spacings is simulated with the CA-FV model for Al- 4. 5 wt% Cu. It has been found that as the spacing decreases below the primary dendrite spacing, lateral solute diffusion in the liquid is first constrained, resulting in shorter secondary arms which may disappear at a later stage due to coarsening, but the tip velocity is not affected. When the spacing decreases further, the liquid diffusion layer at the growth front is also constrained, and the growth velocity is decreased, leading to higher undercooling at the growth front. As a result, the copper concentration in the primary phase is higher. Because the primary phase is cellular and tends to fill the small spacings, solute in the liquid is pushed ahead of the growth front rather than trapped behind, resulting in lower eutectic fraction. Infiltration and solidification experiments are also conducted for the study of solidification through parallel planar channels of different widths. The numerical prediction matches well with the experimental results. ...|$|R
50|$|Bar graphs {{can also}} be used for more complex {{comparisons}} of data <b>with</b> grouped <b>bar</b> charts and <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> charts. In a grouped bar chart, for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped <b>bar</b> chart <b>with</b> different colored <b>bars</b> to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> chart could be used. The <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> chart <b>stacks</b> <b>bars</b> that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable.|$|R

40|$|Cleveland (1985) {{claimed that}} {{comparative}} judgments hould {{be most effective}} when evaluating two graphical components aligned to the same baseline. Hence, bar graphs (bars arranged side by side) should generally be better than <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs (one bar placed above the other). However, <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs {{may be more effective}} for part-to-whole proportion judgments, since the whole is represented explicitly (an emergent feature resulting from the arrangement of the bars). Thirty-five participants were shown <b>bar</b> or <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs, and compared one bar to the other in a part-to-part proportion judgment, or one bar to the sum in a part-to-whole judgment. Completion times and absolute rror were recorded for each condition. Participants made larger errors <b>with</b> <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs in part-to-part tasks, but graph type had little effect on error for part-to-whole tasks. Participants took more time <b>with</b> the <b>bar</b> graphs in the part-to-whole task, but there was little time difference between the graph types in part-to-part tasks. In general, bars were better for the part-to-part task, and <b>stacked</b> <b>bars</b> better for the part-to-whole task. The results show that Cleveland’s claim does not hold true across graph reading tasks...|$|R

Recent {{research has demonstrated}} a method for quantifying the probability of residual UXO harming future land users. Here, we explore how a community neighboring a closed, UXO-contaminated military base responds to the probabilistic risk information this method produces. We explore how probabilistic information affects their risk understanding, risk management preferences, risk perceptions, and worry. We test eight different communication formats employing varying combinations of textual risk descriptions, comparative risk information, <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs illustrating the proportion of future land users at risk, and textual summaries and/or graphical histograms presenting uncertainty. We find that <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> graphs double the odds of correctly reporting the probability of harm and decrease the perceived risk, compared to textual descriptions.

40|$|Objective: There is a {{need for}} {{improved}} methods for display of glucose distributions to facilitate comparisons by date, time of day, day of the week, and other variables for data obtained using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Method: <b>Stacked</b> <b>bar</b> charts are utilized for multiple ranges of glucose values, e. g., very low, low, borderline low, target range, borderline high, high, and very high. Glucose ranges for these categories can be defined by the user, e. g., < 40, 40 – 70, 71 – 80, 81 – 140, 141 – 180, 181 – 250, and 251 – 400 mg/dl. Glucose distributions can be displayed by time of day, in relation to meals, by date, or by day of week. The graphic display can be generated using general purpose spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or with special purpose software. Result: <b>Stacked</b> <b>bar</b> charts are extremely compact and effective.

40|$|International audiencePurpose - Most of the {{proposed}} decision aid methods provide the user only with a prescriptive approach (quantitative analysis) without any descriptive approach (qualitative analysis). It is therefore not possible to justify and recommend ways of improvement. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce visualization techniques to complement prescriptive approaches. Design/methodology/approach - Visual techniques have been developed for the FlowSort sorting method, namely the FS-GAIA and <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> diagrams. Findings - It is found that with visual techniques, fine details can be captured, e. g. detection of incomparability (with FS-GAIA) and the composition of a score (<b>with</b> <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> diagrams). Research limitations/implications - In the future, it is expected that other multi-criteria decision methods will be complemented by prescriptive approaches. Practical implications - A real case study is introduced in order to illustrate the practicality of the visual techniques. In this paper, the innovation performances of small and medium enterprises from the French Lorraine region are assessed. Social implications - It is expected that the quality of the decisions taken are improved because of being better informed.

40|$|Purpose - Performance {{appraisal}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical and indispensable human resource practices for organisations. However, it generates dissatisfaction among employees as it is often viewed as complex and ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to present a new performance management system that integrates multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods - the analytic network process (ANP) and PROMETHEE - with the visual techniques of the GAIA plane and the <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> chart. MCDA methods allow a structured and consistent evaluation integrating qualitative and quantitative criteria. Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a structured and transparent performance management system. It is based on the MCDA methods PROMETHEE and ANP. It also incorporates the visual techniques: GAIA and <b>stacked</b> <b>bar</b> chart. Feedback for trainings and developments can precisely be formulated. Findings - Visual techniques permit clear identification and quantification, for each employee, of the areas that need improvement through training and development, which contributes to the resource-based view of organisations.
