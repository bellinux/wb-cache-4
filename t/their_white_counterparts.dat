5|$|He later {{published}} {{two articles}} in the National Urban League's journal, , that discussed the difficulties faced by African-American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers. Meanwhile, Harris taught at West Virginia State University, a small historically black public college in Institute, West Virginia. During this year, he began a long and sustaining friendship with V. F. Calverton. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position {{as director of the}} Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the UIL {{agreed to}} admit PVIL member schools for competition. Black schools began UIL {{competitions}} {{beginning in the}} 1967-68 school year.

50|$|African Americans and Hispanics, {{compared}} to <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterpart,</b> experience a greater difference in income, education, and occupation levels. On the other hand, Asians experience a lesser difference {{in terms of}} income, education, and occupation levels when {{compared to}} <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterpart.</b> These factors, education and occupation, influence income and purchasing power of an individual. For African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics, higher income resulted in less segregation from <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterpart</b> whereas lower income resulted in greater segregation from <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterpart.</b> However, that an increase in socioeconomic status resulted in a greater decrease in segregation for Hispanics and Asians and a lesser decrease in segregation for African Americans suggests that socioeconomic status alone cannot explain residential segregation.|$|R
25|$|African-American Baptist churches grew {{to include}} {{more than twice the}} number of members as <b>their</b> <b>white</b> Baptist <b>counterparts.</b> The African-American call for social {{equality}} resonated throughout the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s.|$|R
30|$|Other {{demographic}} {{differences may}} also be related to completion behaviour. US evidence presented by Bilginsoy (2003) shows that women and racial minorities {{were more likely to}} cancel apprenticeship programs after enrolling—and were less likely to complete them—than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> male <b>counterparts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b> This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Residential {{segregation}} by {{race and}} economic class prevent low-skilled workers, especially minorities, from moving closer to suburban jobs. Female minority householders {{are twice as likely}} as <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> to live in central cities. As more businesses have retreated to suburban areas, the inner-city, where most low-income minorities reside, often face a decline in employment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Llewellyn's legacy as {{the first}} non-white South African Test cricketer remains large. During the {{apartheid}} period {{he was used to}} show that non-white cricketers could perform as well as <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> while modern day commentators have pointed to the erratic selection of Llewellyn for South Africa throughout his career as the result of prejudice due to his skin colour.|$|E
30|$|Accounting for {{shrinking}} grade variances {{and course}} selection also explains the convergence in grades {{for a group}} where we would expect catch up to not occur: legacies. Legacies at Duke start out behind <b>their</b> <b>white</b> non-legacy <b>counterparts</b> (though not {{as far back as}} blacks) with 65 % of the gape removed {{by the end of the}} senior year. Similar major-switching patterns occur for legacies as well, with large shifts away from the natural sciences, engineering, and economics towards humanities and social sciences. The different grading standards across courses legacies and blacks take, coupled with the tighter variances on the grade distributions of upper year courses, accounts for their catch up to <b>their</b> <b>white</b> non-legacy <b>counterparts.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{were about}} 10. 2 million Black {{women in the}} {{civilian}} labor force in 2015, representing 1 in 7 women in the labor force. Of those, 9. 3 million were employed. On average, Black women tend to have less favorable outcomes than <b>their</b> <b>White,</b> non-Hispanic <b>counterparts.</b> Black women still face a stark wage gap and {{are less likely to}} work in higher-paid occupations. Raising the minimum wage, closing the wage gap, ensuring adequate working conditions and expanding opportunities for higher wage occupations would greatly impact the lives of Black women and their families.

25|$|In the 1950s, {{numerous}} {{school districts}} in Kent and Sussex Counties, including Ellendale, continued to fight against desegregation after the ruling of Brown v. Board of Education. The protests which begin at the Milford School District, eventually bringing about a lawsuit {{that went to the}} Delaware Supreme Court which ruled that while segregation was unconstitutional, it did not require immediate desegregation. This was further bolstered by the findings of Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Bryant Bowles, President of the National Association for the Advancement of White People led several anti-desegregation rallies and boycotts in the area, including Ellendale, that resulted in decreased attendance at the schools. Ellendale School 125 and Ellendale Colored School 195C reached an agreement on consolidation, but attorney Louis L. Redding complained to the Department of Public Instruction that black teachers were being subjected to scrutiny that <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> were not. After desegregation, all students were educated at Ellendale School 125.|$|E
500|$|The {{mobilisation}} {{of white}} British South Africa Police officers {{for military service}} led to black male and white female constables taking on higher responsibilities. The BSAP recruited more black patrolmen to accommodate {{the growth of the}} urban black population during the war, going from 1,067 black and 547 white personnel in 1937 to 1,572 blacks and 401 whites in 1945. This [...] "Africanisation" [...] led to higher appreciation for black constables among senior policemen and the public. The police remained rigidly segregated, but black constables received uniforms more similar to those of <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> and the nominal distinction between the BSAP [...] "proper" [...] and the British South Africa Native Police—the [...] "force within the force" [...] black personnel were traditionally regarded as members of—was abolished.|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} on, Waldron {{spent a lot}} of time in Europe: Paris, Rome, Bologna, and Cologne, before moving {{permanently}} to Munich in 1967. Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for Three Rooms in Manhattan in New York or Paris; Waldron's 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one. Waldron's stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the [...] "fierce, cutthroat competition, just to get a job" [...] and the fact that black musicians were paid less than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> in the U.S. The 1965 score for Three Rooms in Manhattan was followed by one for the American film Sweet Love, Bitter in 1967. Waldron also composed for theater (Amiri Baraka's The Slave and Dutchman), television, and short films. In Europe around this time he played with other expatriates, including Ben Webster and Kenny Clarke.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts,</b> explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity!

S. -educated Asian immigrants, and 3) Asian-born, Asian-educated Asian immigrants. Results from multivariate regression and quantile regressions (at the 10 th, 25 th, 50 th, and 75 th percentiles) show that U.

Further analysis reveals that Asian immigrant women earn less due to their gender, but not because {{of a combination of}} their gender and race. Neither the immigrant women’s birthplace or the origin of their degree further disadvantage their earnings. The lack of multiple disadvantages may be explained by white women earning less than expected, but not Asian immigrant women earning more than expected.

2500|$|Slavery and {{systematic}} inequality and disadvantage still exist within Brazil. Though much {{progress has been}} made since abolition, unequal representation in all levels of society perpetuates ongoing racial prejudice. Most obvious are the stark contrasts between white and black Brazilians in media, government, and private business. Brazil continues to grow and succeed economically, yet its poorest regions and neighborhood slums (favelas), occupied by majority Afro-Brazilians, are shunned and forgotten. Large developments within cities displace poor Afro-Brazilians and the government relocates them conveniently to the periphery of the city. It has been argued that most Afro-Brazilians live as second-class citizens, working in service industries that perpetuate their relative poorness while <b>their</b> <b>white</b> <b>counterparts</b> are afforded opportunities through education and work because of their skin color.
