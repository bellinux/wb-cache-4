No staff member noticed that the pseudopatients were flushing their medication down the toilets and did not report patients doing this.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} volume of Military Operations France and Belgium, 1917 (1917 Part II) Edmonds, wrote that Haig and General Hubert Gough (12 August 1870 – 18 March 1963) the Fifth Army {{commander}} (30 October 1916 – 27 March 1918), were at cross purposes {{before and during}} {{the early part of the}} Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917). Edmonds described meetings between Gough and his corps commanders on [...] at which deeper objectives than those of the GHQ 1917 plan was decided and that an extra objective was added, to be attempted at the discretion of divisional commanders. This fourth objective (red line) was beyond the range of most of the Fifth Army field artillery, so all heavy artillery was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>call</b> to put a defensive barrage beyond advanced posts along it. An advance to the red line was to be attempted only against weak opposition.|$|E
2500|$|To {{bring the}} UK back into {{compliance}} with basic standards in international law, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. The minimum wage takes effect in every worker's contract. Workers {{do not need}} to show [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] or any other requirement except that they personally perform work for a wage and is not a client. One curious exclusion, however, is a pupil barrister who in Edmonds v Lawson was held to not be [...] "working" [...] but be [...] "conscientious in receiving instruction". The minimum wage rate is reset annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, and on 1 October 2014 it stood at £6.50 for over-21-year-olds, £5.13 for 18- to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for under-18-year-olds finished with compulsory education. Since 2010, the minimum was cut for [...] "apprentices", and stood in 2014 at £2.73. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 spell out the details of how the minimum wage should be calculated. Total pay received is divided by the hours actually worked over an average [...] "pay reference period" [...] of one month. This definition has given rise to litigation in cases where a worker can stay at home but must answer phone calls, is allowed to rest or sleep during shifts, or must make themselves available [...] "on call" [...] over a long period. Generally speaking, it is irrelevant whether one is at home or not. If a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid. And if a worker is [...] "on call", then this time still counts at work if the worker is bound to stay within the vicinity of the workplace. However, an exception in regulation 28 allows an employer to agree with a worker what the hours worked actually are, if they would ordinarily be unmeasured. In Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>call</b> 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities outside tasks such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her £31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage. Certain deductions may be made including £4.51 per day for any accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an ERA 1996 section 13 claim for a shortfall of wages in a Tribunal. A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for enquiring, or requesting records or complaining about it. However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.|$|E
