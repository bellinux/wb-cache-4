5|$|The American Dream, or the {{perception}} that Americans enjoy high social mobility, {{plays a key role}} in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} seem to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country {{under the control of}} a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E

25|$|According to critics, one of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the embargo is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> the only major country that has such an embargo against Cuba in place.

25|$|The Bush Doctrine, in {{line with}} long-standing {{neoconservative}} ideas, held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the United States must take responsibility for security and show leadership {{in the world by}} actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} September 11 attacks, Searle {{wrote an article}} arguing that the attacks were a {{particular}} event in a long-term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States, and signaled support for a more aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy. He called for the realization <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> in a more-or-less permanent state of war with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks. Finally, he alluded to the long-term nature of the conflict and blamed {{the attacks on the}} lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America's enemies over the past several decades.|$|E

500|$|The plot of [...] "No Russian" [...] follows Joseph Allen, an {{undercover}} CIA agent tasked with infiltrating and gaining {{the trust of}} a Russian terrorist cell. To achieve this, he must participate in a massacre at Zakhaev International Airport in Moscow. The group's leader, Vladimir Makarov, instructs the gunmen not to speak Russian, so as to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> blamed for the attack. As they prepare to leave the airport, Makarov kills Allen, revealing that he knew of his true identity. Makarov's goal was to use Allen as a false flag, so that when Russian officials discover {{that one of the}} assailants was an American, they would declare war on the United States.|$|E

Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed {{by the international community}} against Russia: [...] "European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation." [...] She argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> leading a new Cold War against Russia.
