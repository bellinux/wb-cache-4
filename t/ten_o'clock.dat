5|$|About <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{last night}} four {{companies}} of picked men moved over the Long Bridge, as an advance guard. They {{were sent to}} reconnoitre, and if assailed were ordered to signal, when {{they would have been}} reinforced by a corps of regular infantry and a battery....|$|E
5|$|The conspirators met for {{the final}} time at 7p.m. Booth {{assigned}} Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house {{and then to a}} rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Deringer, and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock.</b> Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E
50|$|Up {{until the}} advent of the 'combine', a steam {{thrashing}} machine travelled the area, spending a day at each farm thrashing the corn. Thrashing day was a big event on the farms; about 20 local men and women worked on the thrasher starting about 6.00 a.m. until dark. The farmer's wife had a busy day starting with breakfast (traditional), <b>ten</b> <b>o'clocks,</b> dinner (roast beef) and three o'clocks, plenty of good food for such hard work.|$|R

6000|$|While Max Schurz's {{hall was}} rapidly filling with the {{polyglot}} crowd of democratic solidarists, Ernest Le Breton {{and his brother}} were waiting in the chilly little drawing-room at Epsilon Terrrace, Bayswater, for the expected arrival of Harry Oswald. Ernest had promised to introduce Oswald to Max Schurz's reception; and it was now past eight o'clock, getting rather a late hour for those simple-minded, early-rising Communists. 'I'm afraid, Herbert,' said Ernest to his brother, 'he forgets that Max is a working-man who has to be at his trade again punctually by seven o'clock to-morrow. He thinks he's going out to a regular society At Home, where <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock's</b> considered {{just the beginning of}} the evening. Max won't at all like his turning up so late; it smells of non-productivity.' ...|$|R
5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors lockedâ€”an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006, Breakfast {{launched}} its own video podcast called the Breakfast Takeaway. BBC News had already launched three other services: Newsnight, the <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News and STORYFix (also previously shown on television at weekends on News 24). The Breakfast Takeaway was available Monday to Friday in MP4 format {{where it could}} be downloaded to and viewed from a home or office computer.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{positions of}} {{editor of the}} One and Six O'Clock News were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News. The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, {{as a way of}} pooling resources.|$|E

25|$|BBC News was at {{the centre}} of a {{political}} controversy following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Three BBC News reports (Andrew Gilligan's on Today, Gavin Hewitt's on The <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News and another on Newsnight) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister's office) had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.|$|E
25|$|The BBC News at Ten began {{simulcasting}} on {{the channel}} on 30 January 2006 {{as part of}} the <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Newshour, followed by extended sport and business news updates. The bulletin was joined in being simulcast on 10 April 2006 when the BBC News at One (with British Sign Language in-vision signing) and BBC News at Six bulletins were added to the schedule following a similar format to the News at Ten in terms of content on the channel once each simulcast ends.|$|E
25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom {{he thought he could}} trust received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On the way, his adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, so that {{by the time he reached}} his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E
60|$|THE next day, the {{newspapers}} reported {{the discovery of}} a murder in London. A Frenchwoman was the victim. She had been killed by a wound in the throat. The crime had been discovered between <b>ten</b> and eleven <b>o'clock</b> on the previous night.|$|R

25|$|The {{retirement}} of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News led {{to changes in}} the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six O'Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. At the time of the changes, a new set design featuring a projected background image of a fictional newsroom was introduced. New programme titles were introduced on 16 February 2004 to match those of BBC News 24.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News is {{also one}} of the few local newscasts in the United States to have been {{syndicated}} to other television stations. , the program also airs on Fox affiliate KCBA in Monterey (which also carries the weekday editions of Mornings on 2), MyNetworkTV affiliates KRVU-LD in Chico and KEMY-LP in Eureka, California, and Fox affiliate KRXI-TV in Reno, Nevada (the latter of which was co-owned with KTVU under Cox Enterprises from 1997 to 2013, and had also carried KTVU's morning and noon newscasts until Cox discontinued its agreement with KRXI owner Sinclair Broadcast Group to air both programs on May 14, 2014).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Henri Fantin-Latour, Alphonse Legros, and Courbet, Whistler was friendly {{with many other}} French artists. He illustrated the book Les Chauves-Souris with Antonio de La Gandara. He also knew the Impressionists, notably Ã‰douard Manet, Monet, and Edgar Degas. As a young artist, he maintained a close friendship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, {{a member of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His close friendships with Monet and poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©, who translated the <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Lecture into French, helped strengthen respect for Whistler by the French public. Whistler was friendly with his fellow students at Gleyre's studio, including Ignace Schott, whose son Leon Dabo Whistler later would mentor.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the fish at the surface depends largely upon the temperature. They are seen only upon quiet summer days, {{in the morning before}} <b>ten</b> or eleven <b>o'clock,</b> and in the afternoon about four o'clock. Old fishermen say that they rise when the mackerel rise, and when the mackerel go down they go down also.|$|R

60|$|We then {{sought for}} Skinsky, but {{were unable to}} find him. One of his neighbors, who {{did not seem to}} bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had {{received}} by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between <b>ten</b> and eleven <b>o'clock</b> last night. We were at a standstill again.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of BBC News {{the previous}} year, regional headlines were included {{at the start}} of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the Nine O'Clock News moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular News at Ten programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned News at Ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's <b>Ten</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.|$|E
25|$|A unforecast typhoon struck on 9 October {{and after}} various early {{manoeuvres}} the ship lay a-hull {{in the hope}} of drifting down the centre of the Taiwan Strait until the storm - which the captain thought would cross the strait and land near Xiamen - had passed. Unluckily the storm was recurving and passing up the west coast of Taiwan. The expected drift in a generally south west direction was actually between south and south south west straight towards the Penghu Islands. The winds worsened on the 10th and as the ship rolled violently the ships boats were smashed and the deckhouse damaged. At <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{on the night of the}} 10 October three huge waves boarded the ship, smashed the engine and boiler room skylights and, folding below, doused the boilers, filling the machinery spaces with steam.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford {{and delayed}} the match between Essex Eagles and Surrey Lions to after <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock.</b> When it finally began, {{it had been}} {{shortened}} to five overs a side, and Essex made good use of it as they scored 71 for 3 - Ronnie Irani making 32, while Azhar Mahmood took two for three for Surrey. In reply, Antonio Palladino took two wickets for Essex, but it looked up for grabs when Surrey needed eight off five after James Middlebrook bowled a wide that went for four - however, he only conceded six runs from the remaining balls of the game, and Surrey finished on 70 for 2. Yet, {{they would have to}} be exceedingly unlucky in their last game to be eliminated, while Essex jumped into the top three and looked to qualify along with them.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a long}} tramp, but an {{exciting}} one. We reached the North Lake between <b>ten</b> and eleven <b>o'clock,</b> {{and sat down on}} a huge overhanging lava-shelf, tired but satisfied. The spectacle presented was worth coming double the distance to see. Under us, and stretching away before us, was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent. The glare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to look upon it steadily.|$|R
60|$|Whenever such {{opportunities}} as these occurred, it was Squeers's custom to drive {{over to the}} market town, every evening, on pretence of urgent business, and stop till <b>ten</b> or eleven <b>o'clock</b> at a tavern he much affected. As the party was not in his way, therefore, but rather afforded a means of compromise with Miss Squeers, he readily yielded his full assent thereunto, and willingly communicated to Nicholas that {{he was expected to}} take his tea in the parlour that evening, at five o'clock.|$|R
60|$|<b>Ten</b> or eleven <b>o'clock</b> {{found us}} {{coming down to}} breakfast one morning in Cadiz. They told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor two or three hours. It was {{time for us to}} bestir ourselves. The ship could wait only a little while because of the quarantine. We were soon on board, and within the hour the white city and the {{pleasant}} shores of Spain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight. We had seen no land fade from view so regretfully.|$|R
