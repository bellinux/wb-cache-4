30|$|The <b>top</b> <b>level</b> {{forms an}} overlay network between {{aggregators}} and disseminators linked with overlay links that have two possible semantic values: unexploited or outdated but not exploited. Therefore, the computed aggregation functions exclude overlay links from the <b>top</b> <b>level</b> {{that result in}} duplicates (exploitedaggregators). The aggregation memberships, the classification, the selection of aggregators are all complexity hidden from the aggregation process of the <b>top</b> <b>level.</b> As explained in Section “Adaptation strategies”, the adaptation strategies tune the aggregation process in favor of (i) updating aggregates with the most recent selected states (UPDATE) or (ii) discovering new selected states (EXPLOITATION). The <b>top</b> <b>level</b> has to only provide the classification criteria that trigger this optimization and inform about changes in the selected state.|$|R
40|$|The Domain Name System (DNS) is an {{essential}} part of the Internet infrastructure and provides fundamental services, such as translating host names into IP addresses for Internet communication. The DNS is vulnerable to a number of potential faults and attacks. In particular, false routing announcements can deny access to the DNS service or redirect DNS queries to a malicious impostor. Due to the hierarchical DNS design, a single fault or attack against the routes to any of the <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS servers can disrupt Internet services to millions of users. In this paper we propose a path-filtering approach to protect the routes to the critical <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS servers. Our approach exploits the high degree of redundancy in <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS servers and also exploits the observation that popular destinations, including <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS servers, are well connected via stable routes. Our path-filter restricts the potential <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS server route changes to be within a set of established paths. Heuristics derived from routing operations are used to adjust the potential routes over time. We tested our pathfiltering design against BGP routing logs and the results show that the design can effectively ensure correct routes to <b>top</b> <b>level</b> DNS servers without impacting DNS service availability.
