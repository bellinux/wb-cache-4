5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another.

For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to <b>telling</b> <b>his</b> friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
