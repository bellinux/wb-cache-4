25|$|A robot sent to {{the first}} floor of unit 1 records a {{radiation}} level of 2,000 mSv/h. At this level, workers would only be allowed to stay in the area for 8 minutes. In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO worker is able <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the basement and determines that the 11m deep basement is approximately half full of water.|$|E
500|$|At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, {{wrote in}} his diary [...] "he {{had never seen a}} man 'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired" [...] as Chadwick, for he [...] "had plumbed such depths of moral {{decision}} as more fortunate men are never called upon even <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into.....</b> almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arabs, no doubt," [...] muttered Almayer <b>to</b> himself, <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> {{the solid}} blackness. [...] "What are they up to now? Some of Abdulla's business; curse him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dost {{hear the}} cries, Blanca?" [...] asked Dea Flavia, {{as the young}} slave, leaning out of the narrow window tried <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> out <b>into</b> the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Um, wings! Spide he all the samee buttelfly," [...] {{announced}} Hop Lung. [...] "No see him," [...] and he {{got down}} {{on his hands and}} knees <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> up <b>into</b> the corner to make certain.|$|R
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to a lens is to line {{the inside of the}} eye with [...] "mirrors", and reflect the image to focus at a central point. The nature of these eyes means that if one were <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the pupil of an eye, one would see the same image that the organism would see, reflected back out.|$|E
2500|$|More {{renovation}} – and a {{round of}} controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them as they sat on their porches and {{to the ability of}} fans in the upper decks <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> their bedrooms at night. The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season. The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A's, 8–3.|$|E
2500|$|Belknap died {{suddenly}} from a massive {{heart attack in}} Washington, D.C. on Sunday October 12, 1890. The New York Times stated that his death occurred on Sunday between 1:00 A.M and 9:00 A.M., and that he died alone at his residence in the Evans building on New York Avenue. Prior to his death, Belknap had played cards with his friends on Saturday night, then retired upstairs for the evening. Belknap's wife, Amanda, was in New York City at the time. At 8:30 A.M. on Monday morning, Belknap's business associate, John W. Cameron, picked up Belknap's mail {{on the first floor}} of Belknap's home, where he maintained his law office, and proceeded to the second floor, where Belknap lived. Cameron and a maid found that all the rooms had been locked. [...] A janitor was summoned to open the doors, and a step ladder was used <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> Belknap's bedroom. Belknap had placed his hat and coat on a chair and his lifeless body was found on his bed. His left arm had been raised toward his head with his left hand tightly clenched. The bed clothes were disheveled and he appeared to have struggled for breath. The physician who initially examined the body stated that he had died of apoplexy; however, an autopsy by the coroner revealed that Belknap suffered from heart disease. The War Department was notified and received with [...] "genuine sorrow" [...] the news of Belknap's death, since Belknap had been a popular Secretary of War.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} be getting heavier every minute," [...] {{declared}} Jack, as he sheltered his eyes with his hand and tried <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> forth <b>into</b> the darkness. [...] "Why, the snow is coming down in regular chunks!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was good}} {{of them to}} send a man back," [...] said the doctor, as he paused <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> down <b>into</b> the crevasse. [...] "Had we not been warned we might have slipped into that without knowing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{moments of}} bliss that silence a woman rouse {{a man to}} make sure of his rapture. [...] "How do you like it, Marsh?" [...] he asked, trying {{at one of these}} times <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> round <b>into</b> her face. [...] "Are you afraid?" ...|$|R
60|$|He pretended <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> another gallipot {{and then}} took off his {{spectacles}} to wipe them.|$|E
60|$|Hough bent low <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> Allie's face--to see her ring. Then {{he turned}} to Ancliffe.|$|E
60|$|One of {{his sons}} whistled low, causing Naab to rise slowly, <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the darkness, to listen intently.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{this point}} {{one of the}} spectators, more callous <b>to</b> horrors, <b>peered</b> curiously <b>into</b> the dead man's face. He uttered an exclamation of astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Man! Y'u're hurt bad!" [...] exclaimed Blaisdell. The others halted {{in their}} slow march and, {{as if by}} tacit, unspoken word, lowered the body of Isbel to the ground. Then Blaisdell knelt beside Blue. Jean left Colmor to Gordon and hurried <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> down <b>into</b> Blue's dim face.|$|R
50|$|The story depicts The ka-tet of Roland Deschain, Alain Johns and Cuthbert Allgood {{dealing with}} the events {{following}} their return to Gilead from Hambry, including the toll that Maerlyn's Grapefruit has taken on Roland's health, his obsessive desire <b>to</b> continue <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> its depths, {{and the search for}} John Farson and the Big Coffin Hunters.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tredgold {{drew his}} right foot back three inches, {{and at the same}} time tried <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{they would}} knock again,' said Quilp, trying <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the gloom {{by which he}} was surrounded, 'the sound might guide me! Come! Batter the gate once more!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{upper part}} of Sir Marmaduke's figure {{appeared}} in the window embrasure, like a dark and massive silhouette against the yellowish light from within. He stooped forward, seeming <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the darkness.|$|E
60|$|He searched every thicket and path, {{he looked}} behind every tree, and gazed into every pond, but without success; then he hastened into the palace and rushed from room <b>to</b> room, <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> every hole and corner and calling her by name; but only echo {{answered}} in the marble halls--there was neither voice nor footstep.|$|R
6000|$|Fowler {{clapped his}} hands. [...] "Bravo! {{that is all}} we ask of you. To study frogs and mosquitoes, <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> close <b>into</b> the {{constitution}} of the blood or the brain of man, is useful; but, to my mind, the questions raised by these Continental experimentalists are the most vital now clamoring for answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} the recollection, and {{commenced}} <b>to</b> peep and <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the luggage as if in search of some particular piece. Having satisfied herself, she was starting back, when she paused and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{appear to}} be very near death just now," [...] the man said gruffly, as he came nearer <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> our faces. [...] "So you belong on the Hamilton plantation, do you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stretched}} his neck <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> {{the room from}} the side. Heyst, too, made a step forward, under the slight impulse of that slender hand clasping his hand with a thin, bony grasp.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked up}} {{quite close to}} her, bent down {{slightly}} <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> her face. The first of the tropical dawn put its characteristic cold sheen into the sky above the Shore of Refuge.|$|E
5000|$|At the Llandudno party conference 2007, Llwyd {{encouraged}} the party <b>to</b> nominate <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> the House of Lords, citing that Plaid peers would [...] "help ensure planned legislation for Wales was not blocked at Westminster", adding {{that many in}} the Lords may want to prevent full law-making powers for Wales. In January 2011, Dafydd Wigley joined Lord Elis-Thomas in the House of Lords.|$|R
5000|$|Mor Stein is a {{vertical}} standing stone of approximately 3.2 m in height, which is unshaped and uncarved and {{stands in a}} field somewhat separate from any other man-made features of the island. [...] A few {{miles to the north}} is Burroughston Broch with its earth cladding intact, allowing visitors <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> down <b>into</b> the broch from above.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour {{went by and}} it {{continued}} to rain as hard as ever, while the sky remained dark and the wind blew with more or less violence. Time and again Dave went to the cabin door, <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> out <b>into</b> the storm, but each time he turned back disappointed. His chums were not yet in sight.|$|R
60|$|Jet {{heard the}} sound of rapid footsteps, and an instant later the tall man whom he had such good cause to {{remember}} was standing at a safe distance trying <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the shanty.|$|E
60|$|Still it is {{something}} to have shown our artists 'a dream of form in days of thought,' and to have allowed the Philistines <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> Paradise. And this is what Mr. Godwin has done.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{really gone}} an' done it!" [...] Master Williams exclaimed {{in a tone}} of awe, and just at that moment Reddy Jackson stepped from among the network of hose, whence he had evidently been trying <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the yard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} {{reported}} to have inspired fear in motorists because of its open grates, which allowed the motorists <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> down <b>into</b> the Narragansett Bay about 150 ft below, and because the bridge would shake in high winds. Head-on collisions on the 22 ft undivided bridge were reported to be common, and the steel grid pavement was noted as [...] "treacherous" [...] when wet.|$|R
60|$|The route was rocky and uncertain, {{and during}} the next two hours Dave {{realized}} what climbing the Alps must be. At certain spots they had to help one another along, using a rope for that purpose. Once they crossed a split in the rocks several feet wide and of great depth, and it made Dave shudder <b>to</b> <b>peer</b> down <b>into</b> the dark and forbidding depths below.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{fell into}} low {{conversation}} with Jennie, holding out hopeful views of her future, and presently darkness set in. The sky was overcast with heavy clouds; there was no air moving; the heat and oppression threatened storm. By and by Duane could not see a rod in front of him, though his horse had no difficulty in keeping to the road. Duane was bothered by the blackness of the night. Traveling fast was impossible, and any moment he might miss the road that led off to the left. So he was compelled to give all his attention <b>to</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the thick shadows ahead. As good luck would have it, he came to higher ground where there was less mesquite, and therefore not such impenetrable darkness; {{and at this point}} he came to where the road split.|$|R
