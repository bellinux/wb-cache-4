5|$|Washington's at-that-time unique product saw major use as combat rations in World War I. Coffee {{consumption}} on {{the battlefield}} was seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a caffeine boost. E.F. Holbrook, {{the head of the}} coffee section of the U.S. War Department at the time, also considered it an important aid in recovery from mustard gas. It was employed by the Canadian Expeditionary Force from 1914 until the American Expeditionary Force entered the war in 1917, and all production was shifted toward American military use. New, smaller producers also sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army, which in the final period of the war was six <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> supply.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E

In addition, the majority of Detroit residents, including many blacks, have left the city, leaving a glut of abandoned buildings that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.|$|E

25|$|After 1827 {{there were}} no major battles until 1914.

25|$|After {{having been}} {{underground}} for two decades, the Communists enjoyed little popular support at first, {{compared to the}} other opposition parties (however, the decrease in popularity of the National Liberals was reflected in the forming of a splinter group around Gheorghe Tătărescu, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, who later entered an alliance with the Communist Party). Soon after 23 August, the Communists also engaged in a campaign against Romania's main political group of the <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Peasants' Party, and its leaders Iuliu Maniu and Ion Mihalache. In Victor Frunză's account, the conflict's first stage was centered on Communist allegations that Maniu had encouraged violence against the Hungarian community in newly recovered Northern Transylvania.|$|E
25|$|The National Center for Health Statistics {{says that}} {{national}} birth rates for teenagers are at historic lows – during 2007–2010, teen birth rates fell 17% nationally;. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. A study by West Virginia's Marshall University showed that 19% of babies {{born in the}} state have evidence of drug or alcohol exposure. This is several <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> rate, where studies show that about 5.9% of pregnant women in the U.S. use illicit drugs, and about 8.5% consume any alcohol. An Institute for Health Policy Research study determined that mortality rates in Appalachia are correlated with coal production. In twenty West Virginia coal counties mining more than 1 million tons of coal per year and having a total population of 850,000, there are about 10,100 deaths per year, with 1,400 of those statistically attributed to deaths from heart, respiratory and kidney disease from living in an Appalachian coal county.|$|E
25|$|With the {{intention}} of assisting the smaller Army, the Government created the National Guard on 18 August 1831. The new institution would substitute for the old Militias and Orderlies that were extinguished at the same time. The National Guard was composed of all male Brazilians who had an annual income superior to Rs200$000 (the same value as an elector). The majority of the male population had to meet certain conditions {{to be part of}} the National Guard: someone who worked as a craftsman or clerk satisfied the minimum requirements. Even the “ingenuous” (free children of slaves or ex-slaves) were allowed to enlist in the force. The Guard's members were not remunerated and, except for weapons which the Government supplied, the members had to pay all expenses related to uniforms and equipment. However, the Guard's members had little if any military skill and they were completely inadequate for the wars of the Industrial Age. The Guard did not have permanent troops nor barracks for lodging troops. In war <b>times</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Guard was incorporated into the Army of 1st Line and it was, for all effects, a reserve force of the Imperial Army.|$|E
