40|$|The phase-change coating {{technique}} {{presents itself}} as a valuable tool in determining the heat transfer rate {{over the surface of}} small complex wind tunnel models. A numerical technique is described which shows that an effective <b>thermophysical</b> <b>property</b> - the square root of the product of thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat - may significantly improve the accuracy of the phase-change coating technique with allowance for model inhomogeneity and temperature dependency in a transient environment. Results of the measured steady-state variation of the effective <b>thermophysical</b> <b>property</b> with temperature and the effect of surface heating rate on the effective <b>thermophysical</b> <b>property</b> are plotted for a representative homogeneous model material and for an extreme nonhomogeneous model material. The use of an effective <b>thermophysical</b> <b>property</b> to reduce phase-change paint data is recommended. The analysis also confirms that the apparatus described by Corwin and Kramer (1975) can be used to measure directly this effective <b>thermophysical</b> <b>property</b> for use in wind tunnel model heat-transfer measurements...|$|E

40|$|So far the lattice Boltzmann (LB) {{method has}} matured as a {{powerful}} tool to address a diversity of heat and mass transfer challenges. For most practical applications, the variation of <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of working media will influence the performance of industrial systems substantially. However, nowadays the {{efforts to improve the}} LB method to consider variable <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of working media are quite sparse. In the present work we firstly analyze the shortcomings of the available LB approaches for modeling working fluid with variable <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties.</b> Based on the analysis, a simple LB model is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. The feasibility and reliability of the new LB model have been validated by three simple but nontrivial benchmark tests. Although it is originally proposed to simulate fluid flow with variable <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties,</b> the present model can be extended directly to some other research areas where variation of <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of working media should be considered, such as conjugate heat transfer between solid materials...|$|R

In contrast to fabricated engineering materials, with properties which can be specified, rocks used in engineering design are complex, naturally occurring materials having properties which must be characterized, rather than specified, for engineering studies. Much difficulty in measuring, reporting, and using thermophysical properties of rocks results from (1) rock inhomogeneity and anisotropy on both microscopic and macroscopic scales; (2) inclusion of pore fluids, such as water; and (3) measurement of laboratory properties under conditions quite {{different from those of}} in situ material.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{materials}} science and engineering {{is to make the}} best use of all the elements in the periodic table. This leads to the effective use and conservation of natural resources. For this purpose, in any liquid metallic processing operation, accurate data for the <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of all metallic liquids (i. e. liquid metals, semimetals, and semiconductors) is needed. However, in addition, a clear understanding of the essence of their <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties,</b> based on these data, is indispensable. The second volume continues from the first volume to provide explanations for the <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of metallic liquids. The two volumes identify new dimensionless parameters, extracted from the velocity of sound. In spite of being simple parameters, they provide useful information on the nature and behaviour of metallic liquids. This volume covers several basic concepts needed to understand the <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of metallic liquids and for developing reliable models to accurately predict the <b>thermophysical</b> <b>properties</b> of almost all metallic elements in the liquid state, together with methods for quantitative assessment of models/equations. The volume reviews the structure of metallic liquids, which is based on the theory of liquids, density, volume expansivity, thermodynamic properties (evaporation enthalpy, vapour pressure, heat capacity), sound velocity, surface tension, viscosity, diffusion, and electrical and thermal conductivities. The essential points of methods used for measuring these experimental data are also presented.

40|$|The {{identification}} of thermophysical {{properties of materials}} in dynamic experiments can be conveniently performed by the inverse solution of the associated heat conduction problem (IHCP).
