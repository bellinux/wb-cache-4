25|$|Pernkopf {{instructed}} them {{to paint}} the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism {{was the use of}} color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door. The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they would in summer.|$|E

Building on Cascade he added the Twelfth Army to his fictional order of battle, {{and began to}} make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a convincing threat to Crete and the Greek mainland. For this new deception 'A' Force had strong support from London– in April the famed Operation Mincemeat was used to help bolster Clarke's deceptive thrust toward Crete.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} the cafeteria, in which the four boys are annoyed by Pip, is a cut scene from the {{original}} version of the South Park pilot, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"; as such, the animation in that individual scene is actually traditional paper cutout stop motion, while the animation {{throughout the rest of}} the episode is done with computers. In order to illustrate the aftermath after the destruction scenes, Parker and Stone smudged the paper sets with their fingerprints and stains to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> scorch burns.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of limited}} time to film, several edits {{were made to}} the script by Beimler. [...] Some of the scenes set in the cave sets were dropped as they would have taken too long to set up. Kor, Worf and Dax were in almost every scene of the episode and so time could not be saved by filming more than one scene at a time. The cave {{sequences}} were filmed on the cave standing sets on stage 18 of Paramount Studios. The sets were limited, so Burton said that {{in order to make it}} look like the characters were moving through a complex labyrinth of caves, he and director of photography Jonathan West used the sets' depth to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> different parts of the caves.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} storyboard, the Lich's lair was not {{specifically designed to}} be a subway. This was added later by the background designers. The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] bundled up for winter." [...] He strove to make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E
500|$|Inter-sexual mimicry {{occurs when}} {{individuals}} of one sex in a species mimic {{members of the}} opposite sex. An example is the three male forms of the marine isopod Paracerceis sculpta. Alpha males are the largest and guard a harem of females. Beta males mimic females and manage to enter the harem of females without being detected by the alpha males allowing them to mate. Gamma males are the smallest males and mimic juveniles. This also allows them to mate with the females without the alpha males detecting them. Similarly, among common side-blotched lizards, some males mimic the yellow throat coloration and even mating rejection behaviour of the other sex to sneak matings with guarded females. [...] These males look and behave like unreceptive females. This strategy is effective against [...] "usurper" [...] males with orange throats, but ineffective against blue throated [...] "guarder" [...] males, which chase them away. Female spotted hyenas have pseudo-penises that make <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> males.|$|E

500|$|During {{the opening}} of the Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, Gaga {{performed}} the track with The Muppets as backup singers. The singer was dressed in nude colored seashell and rhinestone bra and underwear, with her hair coiffed high, and wearing a septum piercing. Gaga also sang the track on the Japanese variety show SMAP×SMAP on November 28, 2013. [...] "Venus" [...] was included on the setlist for the [...] tour in 2014. She performed it wearing a mop-top wig and clam-shell bikini, while playing a Gibson Flying V guitar. During the performance, 15 large, inflatable flowers rose up from below on stage. The flowers were inflated using an air hose to create a garden on the stage. According to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, [...] "Gaga did 'Venus' in a clamshell bikini and a wig evoking Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C., while her dancers wore sad little white costumes that made <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Woody Allen and Christopher Guest playing sperm cells in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)." [...] In 2017, Gaga performed the song at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.|$|E
500|$|A further 40 {{units were}} ordered—20 from Strømmens Værksted and 20 license-built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. The various {{experimental}} configurations fitted to the prototype trams {{did not work}} too well; and instead a conventional motor solution was chosen. The serial units were also not equipped with regenerative brakes. The series from Strømmen and Skabo received the same motors and bogies, but the electrical equipment was different. The Skabo series had electrical equipment from AEG and was optimized for street-tram operation, while the Strømmen trams were optimized for the suburban tramways and equipped with electrical equipment from Vickers. The Strømmen series was delivered from February to June 1939 and leased to Oslo Sporveier's subsidiary Bærumsbanen, that gave them the designation Class B. They were put into service on the Østensjø–Kolsås Line, with both end stations far outside Oslo's city limits that time. The trams partially ran through a relatively rural landscape, and {{more than any other}} Norwegian tramway this line may be called an interurban. The Oslo Sporveier trams were numbered 164–183, while the Bærumsbanen trams were numbered 184–203. The tram's body was streamlined and had a tail at the end that made <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a goldfish. They were therefore nicknamed [...] "Gullfisk", the Norwegian term for goldfish; this later became the most common term for the class.|$|E
500|$|Early Nez Perce {{horses were}} {{considered}} to be of high quality. Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition wrote in his February 15, 1806, journal entry: [...] "Their horses appear to be of an excellent race; they are lofty, eligantly [...] formed, active and durable: in short many of <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> fine English coarsers [...] and would make a figure in any country." [...] Lewis did note spotting patterns, saying, [...] "... some of these horses are pided [...] with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with the black brown bey [...] or some other dark colour". By [...] "pied", Lewis may have been referring to leopard-spotted patterns seen in the modern Appaloosa, though Lewis also noted that [...] "much the larger portion are of a uniform colour". The Appaloosa Horse Club estimates that only about ten percent of the horses owned by the Nez Perce at the time were spotted. [...] While the Nez Perce originally had many solid-colored horses and only began to emphasize color in their breeding some time after the visit of Lewis and Clark, by the late 19th century they had many spotted horses. As white settlers moved into traditional Nez Perce lands, a successful trade in horses enriched the Nez Perce, who in 1861 bred horses described as [...] "elegant chargers, fit to mount a prince." [...] At a time when ordinary horses could be purchased for $15, non-Indians who had purchased Appaloosa horses from the Nez Perce turned down offers of as much as $600.|$|E

500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
500|$|... "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] was {{directed}} by Nick Hurran, who directed [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] and [...] "The God Complex" [...] of the previous series, {{as well as the}} fifth episode of the seventh series. [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] contains many of the Dalek types that the Doctor has faced over the years, including the Special Weapons Dalek from the 1988 story, Remembrance of the Daleks. According to The Daily Telegraph, the production team located the remaining models of the various versions of the Daleks and shipped them to the studios in Cardiff Bay. This included a Dalek owned by Russell T Davies, Moffat's predecessor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner knew Davies well and asked to borrow his replica. She stated that he was [...] "thrilled" [...] that it was canonised. The total number of different Daleks was around 25, with models from 1963 to 2010; Skinner said that [...] "there was just a real magic and sense of history about having them". Moffat was concerned about how all the different Daleks would look together, but was pleased once he saw them; he commented that the diversity made <b>them</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a species, rather than identical robots. Many of the props were built from scratch. The snow scenes on the asylum planet were filmed in Spain during the production of [...] "A Town Called Mercy". Music featured in the episode are the [...] "Habanera" [...] from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, which is used diegetically, and [...] "Feel the Love" [...] by Rudimental is also featured. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a Dalek, in keeping with the varied [...] "blockbuster" [...] themes for each of the opening titles {{of the first half of}} the series.|$|E
