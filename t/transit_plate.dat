5000|$|An {{interesting}} fact is {{that this}} standard did not concern trial and transit plates. As [...] "test" [...] plates were common in autonomous regions, plates starting with [...] "00" [...] or [...] "01" [...] were often reserved for them, and the <b>transit</b> <b>plate</b> produced in any form on paper.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to a growing car market and the increasing demand of purchasing and selling cars from different regions, the oblong <b>transit</b> <b>plate</b> was introduced, based on paper. When registered, the car was given two plates which should {{be attached to the}} inner side of the windshield and the rear glass. The word [...] "транзит" [...] and [...] "передний номер" [...] (perednij nomer, lit. [...] "Frontal number") or [...] "задний номер" [...] (zadnij nomer, lit. [...] "Rear number") was written on the top row, the second row contained the three-letter regional code (or the two-letter one for military vehicles), and the third row housed the four digits. The oblong metal <b>transit</b> <b>plate</b> was the same with the car, but the regional code contained only 2 letters, which were positioned beneath the word [...] "транзит". This format does not distinguish between civil and military equipment.The diplomatic format received a change as well. The color scheme was the inverse of that of normal plates (white-on-black). Initially, it was the same as the previous diplomatic format, only with the letter [...] "Д" [...] moved to the first place (or to the bottom row on rear plates), but later on the Cyrillic letter eventually got replaced by its Latin equivalent, [...] "D". From the mid-1960s onwards the standard for plates belonging to foreign entities was in force, which sets the format as [...] "L-NN-NNN", where a [...] "D" [...] in the place of L meant a member of diplomatic representatives, a K for correspondents, and an M for sales representatives. It is worth noting that there was a slight change for the plates beginning with M, which removed the dash between the letter and the first number. For example, [...] "M51 01-10" [...] where the first two numbers succeeding the M is the country code.|$|E

50|$|Questions {{were also}} raised about {{tightening}} vehicle licensing rules. The truck had reportedly been using expired <b>transit</b> <b>plates,</b> temporary licence plates {{that are only}} supposed to be used on new cars. They are used illegally to evade vehicle checks in the police national vehicle database and to evade paying taxes. A Russian legislator proposed increasing the penalties for driving illegally using such plates, while another legislator announced measures requiring holders of foreign commercial drivers' licences to acquire an equivalent Russian driving licence.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985 to 1995 the {{diplomatic}} plates have white reflective background with black digits, with blue letters and {{change to a}} CD 000 AA system, with the letters representing the country. The Italian Republic emblem appears {{on top of the}} first two letters of the plate and on the top right the international white oval with a black letter representing Italy's international code (I)Diplomatic plates have blue letters since 1985 and have 4 numbers to avoid confusion with the new civilian plates issued since 1994. These have the [...] "CC" [...] (Corpo Consolare), [...] "CD" [...] (Corpo Diplomatico) and four numbers, while [...] "UN" [...] (Nazioni Unite (Permanent)), [...] "UNP" [...] (Nazioni Unite (Specialists)), and [...] "UNT" [...] (Nazioni Unite (<b>Transit))</b> <b>plates</b> have three. Scheme is CC 0000 AA or UNP 000 AA. The [...] "AA" [...] is a country code (blue) while [...] "0" [...] is a digit. Front and rear plates are identical and both measure 34 by 11 cm.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} where isolation of a single-frequency laser from reflections of an optical network is obtained using reciprocal elements throughout. The principle {{is based on}} the isolation obtained by a double <b>transit</b> quarter-wave <b>plate,</b> which can be generalized. Only linearity and time invariance are required. Thus the network elements can even be nonreciprocal. An application is the isolation of the local-oscillator laser in an integrated optical heterodyne/homodyne receiver...|$|R

OLPF which comprises two or three crystal plates is adopted {{in front of the}} CCD to reduce aliasing in a digitized image. <b>Transiting</b> a triple <b>plate</b> OLPF, an object of the point-source light can separate into eight points which are imaged in CMOS array. The distance of point to point provides us with the information of thickness of each crystal plate. The accuracy of measurement is better than 0. 15 μm. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we review our present {{understanding}} of the composition, {{as well as the}} thermal and magnetic evolution, of the iron-rich cores of terrestrial planets and moons for which evidence of present or past magnetic fields is available. These are (in order of distance from the Sun) Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and Ganymede. Other planets, such as Venus, may have had magnetic fields. It has been speculated that Venus had a magnetic field driven by a thermal dynamo that vanished as the planet cooled (Stevenson et al. 1983; Gaidos et al. 2010), or it may have <b>transited</b> from <b>plate</b> tectonics to stagnant lid, losing its dynamo (Stevenson 2002). Another potential candidate for the presence of a magnetic field is the Jovian moon Io, although strong tidal heating may have prevented the formation of a dynamo (Wienbruch and Spohn 1995). This may also have been true for early Europa. It is likely that other large moons such as Callisto and Titan did not form an iron-rich core at all (e.g., Anderson et al. 2001; Iess et al. 2010). We begin by presenting the general concepts of thermal and compositional dynamos, along with a discussion of differences in crystallization at low and high pressures, and then proceed to discuss new findings and their implications for Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and Ganymede.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1930s {{the format}} of plates never settled down.The first Soviet {{registration}} plates issued in 1931 has an [...] "L-NN-NN" [...] format, where L represents a Cyrillic letter and N being a number. Every registration is linked to a single vehicle, while motorcycle plates differ from those for cars in terms of dimensions. 2 license plates were issued to every vehicles: a frontal plate and a rear plate. Frontal plates for motorcycles are to be mounted along the front wing of a vehicle, while rear ones are to be mounted perpendicular to the rear wing. Registration plates for test-drive vehicles appeared later, which contained the word [...] "проба" [...] (proba, lit. [...] "test") on the top, with the first pair of digits absent, therefore forming the format [...] "L-NN". Two major drawbacks of this format were later found, with the first being that the letter was issued in sequential order regardless of any situation, while {{the second is that}} a letter could stand for two sparsely populated regions, and on the other hand, a large city could possess a number of letters. These drawbacks caused the termination of this format in 1934.In 1934, a new replacement standard was set: the letter on the former design was changed to a digit, and there {{was the name of the}} registry, or [...] "Dortrans" [...] below the digits. There were at first 45 Dortrans, one for each region, under CzUDorTranse, or in its full name, Central management of highways and dirt roads and road transport at the Council of People's Commissars of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and then after a reorganization of administrative divisions, the number went up to 52. The former format was considered temporarily valid and owners must change to the new format before July 1, 1934. The format was not strict, i.e. the number of digits is not necessarily supposed to be 5, and the name of the region could reach up to 8 characters excluding dots and dashed, which made it often writte in abbreviated form. Test-drive and <b>transit</b> <b>plates</b> remained their format, except that the name of the Dortran was replaced by the word [...] "транзит" [...] (tranzit, lit, [...] "transit"), or [...] "проба" [...] (proba, [...] "test"). The plates have usual colors in their public transport variant, but there were experimental numbers in an inverse scheme.At the end of 1936 the format changed once more, with the beginning of the sequence switched to a two-letter code of the regional registry, followed by two pairs of numbers separated by a hyphen, which made it an [...] "LL NN-NN" [...] pattern. The code uses letters of the Russian alphabet except for [...] "Ё", [...] "Й", [...] "Ъ", [...] "Ы" [...] and [...] "Ь". There was a single-line frontal plate plus a double-line rear plate for each vehicles, with motorcycle plates bearing the same format, albeit in a smaller size. This difference existed until 1994. Trial and transit numbers also remained, which replaced the region code with the word [...] "транзит" [...] (tranzit, lit. [...] "transit"), below which positioned a factory code.Near the end of the 1930s, in coordination to the current format, there was also a so-called [...] "уменьшенного" [...] (umen'shennogo, lit. [...] "reduced") format: The plate was smaller, used a narrower and slimmer font, and the regional code became smaller, shifted to the top-left corner, with the numbers down-scaled. At the same time a single format was developed for trailers, but seldom given. Subsequently, this format became the basis for the next change.|$|R
40|$|Wall-bounded flows {{experience}} {{a transition to}} turbulence characterized by the coexistence of laminar and turbulent domains in some range of Reynolds number R, the natural control parameter. This transitional regime takes place between an upper threshold Rt above which turbulence is uniform (featureless) and a lower threshold Rg below which any form of turbulence decays, possibly {{at the end of}} overlong chaotic transients. The most emblematic cases of flow along flat <b>plates</b> <b>transiting</b> to/from turbulence according to this scenario are reviewed. The coexistence is generally in the form of bands, alternatively laminar and turbulent, and oriented obliquely with respect to the general flow direction. The final decay of the bands at Rg points to the relevance of directed percolation and criticality in the sense of statistical-physics phase transitions. The nature of the transition at Rt where bands form is still somewhat mysterious and does not easily fit the scheme holding for pattern-forming instabilities at increasing control parameter on a laminar background. In contrast, the bands arise at Rt out of a uniform turbulent background at a decreasing control parameter. Ingredients of a possible theory of laminar-turbulent patterning are discussed.

40|$|In Walker, the Court deemed Texas’ {{specialty}} {{license plate}} program government speech, and thus applied no First Amendment review to the state’s refusal {{to allow a}} Confederate battle flag specialty plate, even though {{the reason for the}} refusal was that the plate was offensive. The dissent considered this unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in a limited public forum. This article argues that the Walker result was correct, but for the wrong reason. Government should have the power to forbid hateful or vulgar speech from limited public forums such as specialty or vanity license <b>plates,</b> <b>transit</b> ads, and after-school extracurricular activities, even though such restrictions are viewpoint-based. We should borrow from government speech doctrine, where we give the state significant viewpoint-based leeway to advance its views of the good. We should be less concerned about “negative theory,” i. e., distrust of government to draw sufficiently principled lines, in these settings, which we should rebrand “speech platforms. ” We can keep negative theory’s strong principles for regulation of private speech and for speech in traditional public forums such as streets and parks. The article explains that the so-called rule against viewpoint restrictions in limited public forums has been applied only in religious speech cases, where other concerns were also in play, and elsewhere stated only in dicta. And it explores the misattribution concern that so animated the Walker Court and that has been key to several Court decisions in the limited or nonpublic forum setting, arguing that we should rely less often on the concern that people will mistakenly attribute private speech to the state...|$|R
