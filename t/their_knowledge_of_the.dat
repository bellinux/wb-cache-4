5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the arrests of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. <b>Their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested them on <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playbook, {{requiring them to}} copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, {{told them not to}} smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{was stabbed}} by a mysterious figure while scrawling a rape claim that accuses Evelyn's husband Adrian Powell (Tom Irwin). She manages to drag {{herself to the}} pool during a lavish party and falls in. At her funeral, her four maid friends Zoila (Judy Reyes), Valentina (Edy Ganem), Rosie (Dania Ramirez) and Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez) agree not to divulge <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{infidelity}} and its circumstances.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them expand <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament {{periodically}} commissions {{opinion polls}} and studies on public opinion trends in Member States to survey perceptions {{and expectations of}} citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union. Topics include citizens' perception of the European Parliament's role, <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution, their sense of belonging in the European Union, opinions on European elections and European integration, identity, citizenship, political values, but also on current issues such as climate change, current economy and politics, etc.. Eurobarometer analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.|$|E
5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} {{told him that}} he was not going to make another Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a lot from them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E

5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish {{translation}} of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations {{of a set of}} English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Dipavamsa, a chronicle {{written in}} 400 BC, records {{that after the}} Bhikkuni Sangha was established, there was {{widespread}} following in the country among {{women of all ages}} and from all levels of society.

25|$|Al-Tamimi, the {{physician}} (d. 990) became renown for his skills in compounding medicines, especially theriac, an antidote for poisons. His works, {{many of which}} no longer survive, are cited by later physicians. Taking what was known at the time by the classical Greek writers, Al-Tamimi expanded on <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties of plants and minerals, becoming avant garde in his field.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{both the}} Allied and Axis powers {{systematically}} provided amphetamines to their troops, {{in order to}} improve soldiers' endurance and mental focus. After the end of the war, many of those returning troops attended college, and when they did, they applied <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits of amphetamine use first to college sports, and then to professional sports, including professional baseball.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together. This {{is to say that}} the rememberer infers <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target word, and the imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E
25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel {{was that the}} {{subjects}} were randomly allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on {{the order in which}} they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group to which they would occupy).|$|E

25|$|A 1996 {{study of}} {{corporate}} {{codes of conduct}} in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standards to which their employers are subject.|$|E
25|$|Heinrich Eggestein's {{return to}} Strasbourg is {{certainly}} verified, as he again got {{the rights of}} citizenship on 9 August 1459. However, {{it is not known}} whether and in what way Eggestein might have participated in the printing shop operated by Johannes Metelin in Strasbourg. It is indisputable, however, that the two men knew each other and had a close relationship. It is even thought to be possible that Mentelin and Eggestein swore to keep <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art of book printing a secret, through an agreement which has unfortunately not been preserved.|$|E
25|$|During the American Indian Wars of the 1830s, the United States built Fort Myers {{as one of}} {{the first}} forts along the Caloosahatchee River; it was used as a base of {{operations}} against the Seminole. During the Seminole Wars and Indian Removal period, Fort Myers was a strategic location, with access to Atlantic waterways. While many Seminole were forced to remove to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River, others used <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Everglades and Florida wilderness to resist the Americans.
