40|$|The <b>Topometer</b> is {{a system}} for {{measuring}} and analysing the time dependence of motion in orthopedic studies. The measurements are performed via emission and registration of ultrasonic waves. The intrinsic accuracy {{of the system is}} a few tenths of a mm. Investigations of the accuracy of the <b>Topometer</b> have shown that the reproducibility of the measurements depends critically on the knowledge of the sound velocity. Distortions in the measurements can occur if the position of the receiver is badly matched to the direction of the ultrasonic transmitter. This effect has been studied and simulated in detail, and means of correcting such distortions are discussedAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 4852 (93 - 31) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|E
30|$|A 3 D optical <b>topometer</b> (Wyko NT 9100) {{was used}} to measure the surface roughness, {{choosing}} five points (1.3 [*]×[*] 0.95  mm in area) for each ground sample, and then averaging. To investigate the surface topography and surface defects, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEG-SEM Zeiss Ultra 55) was used in this study.|$|E
40|$|Well-known {{methods of}} surface {{measurement}} determine the surface geometry {{but do not}} deliver any information about the surface material. We investigated reflection-ellipsometric methods for high-resolution surface measurement. The topography and the material distribution are determined simultaneously by combinative evaluation of the light polarization. Scanning the surface with a novel PSA-ellipsometer with focused measurement beam (micro-ellipsometer) we measured the local distributions of four ellipsometric parameters. They are {{used to calculate the}} local gradient angles and the complex refraction index. These parameters are used to calculate the surface profile and to identify the surface material. We carried out successful tests with various surfaces. A possible application field of the method is e. g. the quality control. The ellipsometer can be combined with other <b>topometers.</b> In addition to the material identification it is conceivable to determine other material characteristics (e. g. alloy-variations, corrosion).
