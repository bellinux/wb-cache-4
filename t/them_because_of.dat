5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E

5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public employees.

5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E
5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E

5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators {{made for the}} home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in commercial operation to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
5|$|In September 1929, Wessel met Erna Jänicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in {{a tavern}} {{not far from}} Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke's procurer. On 1 November she moved into his room {{on the third floor}} of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sub-let from 29-year old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Freedom Fighter, {{although}} she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent; Salm wanted Jänicke to leave, but she refused to, and Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help on the evening of 14 January 1930. At first the Communists were not interested in helping her, as she was not well-liked by <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and get him out of Salm's flat by force.|$|E
5|$|In his 1877 {{monograph}} on North American rodents, Elliott Coues mentioned two {{specimens of}} Oryzomys from Jamaica in {{the collections of}} the United States National Museum (USNM). According to Coues, the specimens were similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) of the United States, but different in color. Although he wrote that they probably represented a separate form, he refrained from giving a scientific name to <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the possibility that the}} form had already received a name he did not know of. The species was first formally described by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 based on a specimen that had been in the British Museum of Natural History since 1845. He recognized it as a separate species of Oryzomys, Oryzomys antillarum, but wrote that it was related to the mainland Central American O.couesi. Thomas suspected that the species was already extinct on Jamaica, but that it or a similar rice rat could still be found in the unexplored interior of Cuba or Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers {{failed to}} finish the race, six of <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{accidents}} including Kubica. Four of them gearbox failures. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a groundhog on the racetrack. This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars {{were on the same}} lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all of the incidents and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably. Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; he {{was accompanied by a}} great many indigenous allies. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco {{were less likely to be}} rounded up into new reducción settlements than elsewhere in Chiapas, since the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E

5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape <b>them</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{his ability to}} quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the {{regiment}} returned to their previous task of flank protection. At midday the 3rd and 11th Squadrons were located along the ridge south-east of El Buggar, forcing the Turkish observation posts to retire. The day was almost {{a replica of the}} previous one and the regiment was back at Shellal at 21:30. Instead of resting overnight, they moved to El Mendur, arriving there at 06:00 on 19 April. The division was now required to be more aggressive, to draw the Turkish forces towards <b>them,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lack of progress by the force attacking Gaza. The 3rd Squadron was detailed as a guard force for the division's artillery, accompanying them to Atawineh. The squadron moved into the front line, losing one dead and seventeen wounded by the time it withdrew at 20:00. The rest of the regiment was held in reserve, having two men wounded during an aircraft attack. By the end of the day, the second attempt to take Gaza was called off, the defences being to strong for a frontal assault.|$|E
