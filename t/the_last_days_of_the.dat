5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign, Douglas {{finally began}} to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out {{on behalf of his}} wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit in Germany, she {{returned}} to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships, commerce raiders, and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months. She remained in Germany {{for the rest of}} the year after returning in July. The ship was transferred to France in early 1942 to escort the capital ships as they sailed through the English Channel to return to Germany (the Channel Dash). Ihn was then transferred to Norway where she participated in several unsuccessful attacks on convoys to the Soviet Union. Afterwards {{she returned to}} Germany and remained there {{for the rest of the}} year. The ship spent most of 1943 in the northern Norway although she was mostly inactive because of fuel shortages. Ihn was ordered home for a long refit late in the year and she was sent to southern Norway upon its completion in mid-1944. The ship remained there for the rest of the war, although she made several trips to evacuate refugees from East Prussia in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{conflict}} erupted {{again in}} 1459, and again Clifford {{was found on}} the side of the King and Queen. Clifford took part in the parliament that attainted the Yorkists– by now in exile– and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at Northampton. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the earl of Salisbury, raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the Battle of Wakefield in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, York's seventeen-year old second son and the younger brother of the future King Edward IV. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford,' although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.|$|E

5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz {{was on his way to}} surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
5|$|German {{forces had}} started gradual {{withdrawal}} to northernmost Finland in early September 1944 in Operation Birke. As {{the value of}} Petsamo region had decreased, the Germans decided in early October 1944 to abandon Finland and most of northern Norway and had begun Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light), a retreat into prepared positions at Lyngen in northern Norway. Operation Nordlicht {{had come to an}} end at the beginning of January 1945, with only a few miles of Finnish territory remaining in German hands, and several isolated garrisons in Norwegian Finnmark. Soviet forces occupied eastern Finnmark, and the USSR asked that Western Allied forces be landed to support them. Only a single company of Norwegian mountain infantry could be spared for this duty, though the British and Norwegian governments provided food supplies for the civilian population in the area. Due to the failure of the recent offensive in the Ardennes and the fact that several new types of U-Boat were ready to be deployed, the German positions in Norway became of great value to Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command as a way to continue submarine warfare against the Allies. They also were to Adolf Hitler, who denied requests from General Heinz Guderian that divisions should be withdrawn from Norway for use in the defence of Germany, and from Böhme in March that northern Norway should be abandoned and that construction of submarine pens should come to a halt due to lack of materials. He feared that any withdrawal might tempt neutral Sweden to enter the war in support of the Allies, and that any withdrawal from northern Norway would endanger U-Boat bases in the southern parts of the country. Until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Dönitz believed that Norway should be kept in order to deploy submarines against Allied vessels, and on 3 May the Kriegsmarine Naval Warfare Command informed U-Boat staff that even if Germany itself were occupied, submarines would still sail from Norway. Only on 4 May were orders issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht that all German troops in Norway were to avoid actions that might provoke Allied forces.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{improve the}} quality of {{end-of-life}} care in geriatric hospital wards we developed the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life. It consists of 1) the Care Guide for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life, 2) supportive documentation and 3) an implementation guide. The aim of this study is (1) to determine the feasibility of implementing the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life in <b>the</b> acute geriatric hospital setting and (2) to explore the health care professionals' perceptions {{of the effects of the}} Care Programme on end-of-life care. Methods: A phase 2 mixed methods study according with the MRC framework was performed in the acute geriatric ward of Ghent University Hospital between 1 April and 30 September 2013. During the implementation process a mixed methods approach was used including observation, interviews and the use of a quantitative process evaluation tool. This tool measured the success of implementation using several indicators, such as whether a steering group was formed, whether and how much of the health care staff was informed and trained and how many patients were cared for according to the Care Guide for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life. Results: <b>The</b> process evaluation tool showed that implementing the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life in <b>the</b> geriatric ward was successful and thus feasible; a steering group was formed consisting of two facilitators, health care staff of the geriatric ward were trained in using the Care Guide for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life which was subsequently introduced onto the ward and approximately 57 % of all dying patients were cared for according to the Care Guide for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life. With regard to health care professionals' perceptions, nurses and physicians experienced the Care Guide for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life as improving the overall documentation of care, improving communication among health care staff and between health care staff and patient/family and improving the quality of end-of-life care. Barriers to implementing the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life successfully are, among others, difficulties with the content of the documents used within the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life and <b>the</b> low participation rate of physicians in the training sessions and audits. Conclusions: Results of this mixed methods study suggest that implementing the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life is feasible and that it has favorable effects on end-of-life care as reported by health care professionals. Based on the identified barriers during the implementation process, we were able to make recommendations for future implementation and further refine the Care Programme for <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Life before implementing it in a phase 3 cluster randomized controlled trial for the evaluation of its effectiveness...|$|R
