40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze the {{determinants}} of the high-tech sector innovation performance in the European Union (EU) countries.

Our findings show that the number of employees in the high-tech industry positively influences the number of patents while the R&D expenditure per capita has a negative impact. Other factors like the expenditure on education, the government R&D expenditure, the economic development, the number of employees in the science and technology field and the exports’ level, have no influence on the innovation performance in the high-tech industry. However, when we assess the innovation performance through community <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>applications,</b> we discover that most of the above mentioned factors can be considered as determinants of the innovation performance.

40|$|The {{wording of}} s 8 (2) (b) of the Trade Marks Act – which sets out the {{relative}} ground for refusal of a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>application</b> for a mark {{that is the}} same or similar to an earlier mark registered in relation to the same or similar goods or services {{as long as there is}} a likelihood of confusion – is identical to that in s 27 (2) (b) relating to infringement of a trade mark. The wording is taken from ss 5 (2) and 10 (2) of the UK Trade Marks Act 1994 (which in turn derives from the European Council Trade Marks Directive). The European Court of Justice, in its O 2 Holdings Ltd v Hutchison 3 G Ltd ([2008] ETMR 55) judgment, drew attention to the important difference in how the identical words should be applied in the application and infringement contexts: in the former, the analysis must assume notional and fair use of the mark by the applicant in relation to all the goods or services in its specification; and in the latter, it should take into account the context of the use by both plaintiff and alleged infringer. This issue arose in Staywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels 2 ̆ 6 Resorts Worldwide, Inc, and the judge followed earlier Singapore authorities, which decided that the wording should be applied in the same way in both contexts.

40|$|This report {{explores the}} problem of “cluttering” of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers. The report {{consists}} of two parts: the first presents a conceptual discussion of “cluttering” of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers. The second part provides an exploratory empirical analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>applications</b> at the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and the European <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office (OHIM). This part contains results of a descriptive and an econometric analysis. According to our definition, cluttering arises where firms hold <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> that are overly broad or unused raising search costs for later applicants. The report distinguishes between three mechanisms {{that can lead to}} cluttering. It also considers a series of mechanisms that work against cluttering. This discussion is based on a review of the previous literature. The tentative empirical evidence provided {{in the second part of}} the report suggests that <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> are more frequently registered in several classes at the same time and also that firms in pharmaceuticals increasingly resort to multiple simultaneous applications to ensure that they will register at least one <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> There is also some evidence that firms seek to avoid mechanisms such as relative grounds examination which can prevent cluttering. Finally, we report direct survey-based evidence that applicants perceive cluttering to be a problem in specific fields and countries. However, our exploratory analysis does not provide strong evidence that cluttering has already become a systemic problem for the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> systems that is comparable to the effect of patent thickets for patent systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{a report}} {{provided}} by the European Chamber of Commerce in China, the problem with bad faith trade mark applications was highlighted. The report concluded that the current application of the law, combined with the procedural background constitutes an incentive rather than a deterrent for bad faith trade mark applications in China. The issue originates in Chinese defrauders conducting research among foreign companies {{with the intent of}} un- lawfully registering their trade marks in China. Since China apply a ‘first-to-file’ system, un- registered trade marks enjoy very little protection. Companies, and foreign companies in particular, are therefor often forced to rebuy their trade marks from the bad faith filers. The Chinese government are, however, not blind to this issue and recently, a draft amend- ment to the Trademark Law was released, partly aimed at obstructing bad faith filing. In remains, however, to be seen whether the amendment will have any great impact on the is- sue of bad faith trade mark applications. The purpose of this thesis is to ascertain the core to the problem with bad faith trade mark applications and to establish whether the new amendment provides a solution to this issue. The thesis uses a comparative method by studying the EU approach to bad faith trade mark applications and to put it in relation to the system used in China. The analyse demonstrates that the core to the problem with bad faith trade mark applica- tions in China fall into several aspects significant to the Chinese trade mark system, primar- ily through the construction of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>application</b> process and the ineffective appa- ratus operating the Chinese judicial system. Although the new amendment is a great leap in Chinese trade mark development, it does not sufficiently address the issue with bad faith trade mark applications...|$|E
40|$|According to EU and {{international}} trade mark law, signs that are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality may be denied registration. Public policy and morality are open legal concepts {{that provide a}} typical entrance door for fundamental rights, allowing the taking into account of ethical values when defining the content and scope of intellectual property law. As IP offices are EU or national institutions that are bound by fundamental rights protection, the conformity of their practice needs to be tested {{with regard to the}}se higher constitutional principles. In this article, we will verify if the current practices with regard to the refusal to register immoral trade marks on morality and public policy grounds take sufficiently into account fundamental rights, and in particular the freedom of expression and freedom to conduct business of trade marks applicants. If the decisions of the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) will be given the main attention, those of the General Court of the European Union (GCEU), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the EFTA Court will also be considered. The European practice will then be compared to the recent case law on this topic in the United States, in particular to the Supreme Court decision Matal v. Tam of June 2017, already considered by some commentators as a historical development as it overturns a long tradition of trade mark precedent barring from protection offensive and disparaging trade marks. We conclude that the implications of fundamental rights protection in the EU might lead to different results than in the US and that the practice developed by the EUIPO with regard to immoral trade marks is in general consistent with the standards required by the European legal order. However, there might be some (rare) situations where a new approach could be needed in the future, for example when the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>application</b> can qualify as mixed expression, both commercial and political or artistic in nature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of prior use in common and {{statutory}} trade mark law. In the United States a pertinent requirement is priority of use. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a reputation must be present. In the United Kingdom a plaintiff is required to have goodwill in the country, but in the United States and South Africa it is not required. The conception of a mark does not qualify for protection. It is not required that a business must have actually entered the market. In the United States the general approach is that a plaintiff will not receive protection in a remote area, but regard must be had to zones of natural expansion. British and South African law is the same, and protection may be obtained in areas {{where there is no}} trading. Where a dual reputation exists, neither party will be able to act against the other. The mere fact that the user of a mark was aware of the use thereof by another person, does not exclude protection. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>application</b> can be opposed on the basis of another application, combined with use of a mark, or on the ground of prior use. In some instances the fact that a mark has been filed will influence the burden of proof. In general, a registration can be expunged on the same grounds as would constitute grounds of opposition. The concurrent use of a mark can form the basis for the registration of a mark. In the United States, the use must have taken place prior to the filing date of the other party, but in the United Kingdom and South Africa, prior to the own filing date. In the latter two countries, knowledge of a mark is not necessarily exclusionary. Prior use is generally accepted as a defence to an infringement action. It is, however, noted that in various countries, it is only use prior to the relevant date that will be protected, and there is not necessarily a right to extend the scope of use concerned.

40|$|Abstract: Our {{economic}} model and econometric estimates investigate {{the relationship between}} technological activity, proxied by R&D, patents, and <b>trade</b> <b>marks,</b> and employment for a panel of large British firms in the production sector from 1987 to 1994. We modify the standard derived demand function for labour to include technology variables. R&D activity may itself be more labour intensive than other firm activity, but together with measures of intellectual property assets, can also capture the effect of product and process improvements (via expected future sales and market power) on the firm's demand for labour. For product improvements the linkages to employment are clearly positive; process technological change has historically been viewed as labour saving, but at the firm level even this may contribute to firm growth and survival via cost competitiveness. We find that employment is fostered by R&D expenditure and patent publications, ceteris paribus on factor costs and current sales. Even so there are interesting differences between firms operating in sectors traditionally considered as high-technology and those in more mature sectors. The employment impact of R&D is bigger in the former, but the employment increase from UK patenting activity is bigger in the latter. In the panel regression, including firm fixed effects, we found no separate impact of European patents, nor of British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> <b>applications.</b> However in a cross section analysis of persistent differences between firms (measured by estimated firm fixed effects) the possession of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> is positively associated {{with the level of}} firm employment...|$|R
