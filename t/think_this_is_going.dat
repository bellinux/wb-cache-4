"Well, I don't want to jinx it, but I'm {{pretty sure}} it's the best episode, {{and maybe not}} just of this show but of any show on {{television}} ever, any theater show, any staged show, movie, or any, like, campfire ritual performed by cavemen. Take {{it all the way}} back. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the thing everyone talks about {{for the rest of their}} lives, and it will live on in infamy and history. If aliens came down and wanted one artifact to learn about human life, I think it would be this episode of Parks and Recreation. And you can take that to the bank." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] {{has been}} mixed. Ruth Harrison from 'Female First' {{was impressed by}} the song after initially being worried that Cole {{would not be able to}} cope going solo. She said [...] "Whilst it does sound just a little bit Girls Aloud-y, we still love it, and can see it being a huge hit on the club circuit up and down the country ... we <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to send her well on her way to global superstardom." [...] Popjustice also liked the song saying [...] "'Fight For This Love' is very definitely not just a Girls Aloud single with one person singing it... its one of those songs you can have on repeat for an hour and a half without getting bored. One thing that hits you is - well, is this really what Cheryl sounds like? Vocally it's a big surprise... As it turns out, she sounds really great - strong, confident, direct. Like a proper pop singer. It's a sleek, powerful production..." ...|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E

5000|$|When first cast in The Wire, Pierce and his castmates {{doubted the}} show {{would be a}} hit: [...] "I {{remember}} the first time we all sat around and watched the pilot.

2500|$|Opinions {{were divided}} among analysts {{about the effect}} that the {{accident}} would have on military relations with India. A Russian defense analyst remarked that it was unlikely that the incident [...] "would scare India away." [...] On the other hand, Golts stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be another serious blow to cooperation with India. India will be even more concerned about the quality of Russian weapons." [...] He also stated that India had desired secrecy, lest the United States apply pressure to scuttle the deal, but that with no other suppliers of such submarines, India would probably still accept the deal. The planned lease of the submarine to India was in 2008 reported to be cancelled following the incident. However, the submarine was officially inducted into the Indian Navy on 4 April 2012 as INS Chakra.|$|E
2500|$|The Vegas eRace {{was heavily}} {{promoted}} {{in the days}} before the event. The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know. If all you do is race on simulators at home, then maybe they are pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

When describing their upcoming record, they said that [...] "the first record was more, kind of, electro-pop, the second record was more of a rock record, and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a little more hip hop".|$|R

These fellows have been every bit as brave as the Zulus. They cut Hicks Pasha's army into mincemeat, and they have licked two Egyptian armies down in this neighbourhood. If you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be no harder work than a field-day at Aldershot, I think {{you are likely to}} find you are mistaken." ...|$|E

Rosenblum added, [...] "We don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> case <b>is</b> <b>going</b> anywhere. It <b>was</b> groundless from the beginning".|$|R

"Black Sun <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be… I’m naming it that {{specifically}} {{because the first}} record was From One, the second record was Duality and there are kind of spiritual connotations in all of that.

Then, even if {{it keeps}} a stark calm like this, we shall {{be able to get}} across the sands and a mile or two up the channel before we meet the tide. There we must anchor again till the first {{strength}} is past, and then if the wind springs up we can work along {{at the edge of the}} sands against it. There is no tide close in to the sands after the first two hours. But I still <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to turn into wind presently; and if it does it will be sharp and heavy, I warrant. It's either that or rain." ...|$|E

50|$|If {{you use a}} good vaccine you {{can prevent}} the {{transmission}} within poultry and to humans. But {{if they have been}} using vaccines now China for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can't blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.|$|R

500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> record <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to help those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people {{to listen to it}} and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?"

5000|$|The double {{standard}} here is simply incredible.

5000|$|Nuvo Newsweekly dubbed Karen Tallian [...] "The Pot Legislator". She {{has backed}} both the {{decriminalization}} {{of marijuana and}} allowing doctors to prescribe it as a legal form of pain medication. Her case was bolstered by the support of Indiana State Senator Brent Steele (R-Bedford) but he dropped his support after states like California and Colorado adopted their own laws because he believed the debate had changed and those states' legislation would strengthen opposition in Indiana. Tallian has continued to push for allowing doctors to prescribe it. She has allied with Indiana State Representative Linda Lawson (D-Hammond) on the issue. Tallian told Nuvo in April 2015: [...] "Frankly, I {{will tell you that}} as long as our current governor (Mike Pence) is in office, I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ever <b>going</b> to happen." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Objectives. Does {{predictive}} {{power for}} outcomes of {{neonatal intensive care}} unit (NICU) patients get better with time? Or does it get worse? We deter-mined the predictive power of Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) scores and clinical intuitions {{as a function of}} day of life (DOL) for newborn infants admit-ted to our NICU. Methods. We identified 369 infants admitted to our NICU during 1996 – 1997 who required mechanical venti-lation. We calculated SNAP scores on DOL 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and weekly thereafter until either death or extubation. We also asked nurses, residents, fellows, and attendings on each day of mechanical ventilation: “Do you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> child <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to live to go home to their family, or die before hospital discharge?...|$|R
