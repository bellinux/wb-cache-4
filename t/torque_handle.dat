40|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies into {{the dynamics of}} a ball–racket impact have recorded ball velocities and trajectories {{in one or two}} dimensions. These studies were limited in terms of possible impact positions and the ability to represent realistic impact conditions. As the number of dimensions in an experiment increases, it becomes difficult to isolate single variables and to monitor their effect on the output. This paper describes a method of accurately assessing the effect of specific independent variables in impact experiments with a large number of variables. A total of 900 impacts on a Head Ti-S 6 tennis racket were recorded within bespoke impact apparatus. The impact velocity, the impact angle, the impact position, and a restrictive <b>torque</b> about the <b>handle</b> were varied between each impact. Each test was recorded with two Phantom high-speed video cameras at 600 [*]frames/s; the use of two cameras allowed the ball trajectory to be tracked in three dimensions.

It was found that applying a <b>torque</b> about the <b>handle</b> reduced the angular deviation for all impact positions along the racket's transverse axis.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{effective}} framework of human-humanoid robot physical interaction. Its key com-ponent {{is a new}} control technique for full-body balancing {{in the presence of}} external forces, which is presented and then validated empirically. We have adopted an integrated system approach to develop humanoid robots. Herein, we describe the importance of replicating human-like capabil-ities and responses during human-robot interaction in this context. Our balancing controller provides gravity compen-sation, making the robot passive and thereby facilitating safe physical interactions. The method operates by setting an appropriate ground reaction force and transforming these forces into full-body joint <b>torques.</b> It <b>handles</b> an arbitrary number of force interaction points on the robot. It does not require force measurement at interested contact points. It requires neither inverse kinematics nor inverse dynamics. It can adapt to uneven ground surfaces. It operates as a force control process and can therefore accommodate simultaneous control processes using force, velocity or position based control. Forces are distributed over supporting contact points in an optimal manner. Joint redundancy is resolved by damping injection in the context of passivity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC torque tool testing rig that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject testing. The testing rig, which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the <b>torque</b> tool <b>handle,</b> is used to analyze the tool handle angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the tool handle displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model. Therefore, this study shows that by suing an offset to compensate for the coulomb friction, the tool testing rig can be used to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of the human arm under...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a geometrically thin, Keplerian disk in the orbital plane of a {{binary black hole}} (BHBH) consisting of a spinning primary and low-mass secondary (mass ratio q < 1). To account for the principle effects of general relativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution equation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our modified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while the tidal <b>torque</b> is <b>handled</b> in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is reasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of the secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the orbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal torque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether following merger. By contrast, the viscous torque drives the flow into the strong-field region and onto the primary during all epochs. Following binary coalescence, the viscous torque alone governs the time-dependent accretion onto the remnant, {{as well as the}} temporal behavior, strength and spectrum of the aftermath electromagnetic radiation from the disk. We solve our GR-hybrid equation for a representative BHBH-disk system, identify several observable EM signatures of the merger, and compare results obtained for the gas and EM radiation with those found with the Newtonian prescription.

40|$|The 4 T, 10 m free bore twin Solenoid with 4 Tm forward dipoles is {{discussed}} {{with an emphasis}} on the forward dipoles. This assembly, a possible detector magnet layout for the future circular collider for hadron-hadron physics, combines a 4 T axial magnetic field at the interaction point {{in the center of the}} twin Solenoid with off-axis magnetic fields generated by the two forward dipoles for the purpose of providing bending power to all particles emanating from the interaction point. The twin Solenoid provides 4 T over a free bore diameter of 10 m, resulting in a stored energy of 15. 4 GJ, a cold mass of 1. 25 kt, and a vacuum vessel mass of 1. 4 kt. This configuration leads to acceptable quench protection and mechanical properties. The forward dipoles are located in the stray field of the twin Solenoid, resulting in large forces and torques on the coils. Two forward dipole options are presented. In the first option, the main dipole coils are combined with lateral coils for the purpose of bringing the net force and torque on the cold mass to zero. In the second option, the lateral coils are omitted and the net force and <b>torque</b> is <b>handled</b> through the vacuum vessel. The first option results in a stored energy of 240 MJ, a cold mass of 250 tons, and a vacuum vessel of 150 tons, whereas the second options gives 130 MJ, 100 tons, and 180 tons, respectively. The forward dipole conductor comprises copper and NbTi and is force-flow cooled with helium. The superconducting coils are placed in a stainless steel coil casing and precompressed.

40|$|A {{low torque}} {{spinning}} method has been recently developed by integrating the ring spinning process with false twisting techniques. As {{a result of}} false twist and true twist, a novel single yarn of low <b>torque</b> and soft <b>handle</b> is generated. Based on the similar spinning principle, this paper proposed a 2 -step spinning method, which is composed of twisting-anduntwisting operation and {{can be considered as}} a variant of the low torque spinning method. The proposed spinning method separates the false twisting process into twisting and untwisting processes which are combined in one step in the low torque spinning method. In this paper, physical properties of yarns produced by the proposed spinning method were evaluated and compared with the conventional yarns. Influences of various spinning parameters on the properties of 2 -step yarns were also examined. Furthermore, a systematic study of the physical properties of the 2 -step yarns and resultant fabrics with respect to the conventional and low torque ones was carried out. The experimental results showed that the 2 -step yarns exhibit slightly higher tenacity, lower wet snarl and much less hairiness than the conventional yarns, which, however, are inferior to the low torque yarns, particularly the evenness.

The present paper extends the work for the production and optimization of modified yarns at a fine yarn count (80 Ne). Compared with the conventional ring spinning system, the modified system presents a different and complicated spinning condition in terms of yarn tension and twist distributions, {{as well as the}} interaction between the false twisting device and conventional ring frame. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically investigate the quantitative relationship between spinning system parameters and physical properties of the fine modified yarns using the combined statistical methods of fractional factorial and response surface methodology. In this paper, potential spinning system parameters are proposed and the significances of their effect on yarn properties are quantitatively evaluated.

40|$|Yarn {{structure}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the properties of spun yarns. Recently, a modified spinning technique has been developed for producing a low <b>torque</b> and soft <b>handle</b> singles yarn by modifying the fiber arrangement in a yarn. Comparative studies revealed that the finer modified yarns possess significantly higher strength and lower hairiness over the conventional yarns of the same twist level, implying a different structure of finer modified yarn. Thus this paper aims to quantitatively study the structures of the finer conventional and modified cotton yarn (80 Ne) produced at the same twist level. Various measuring techniques, namely the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), cross section technique and tracer fiber technique, are adopted to analyze their structural characteristics, including fiber configuration, fiber spatial orientation angle, fiber packing density, yarn surface appearance, and fiber migration behavior. Results showed that finer modified yarns exhibit a smoother surface and much more compact structure with less hairiness. The fibers in the finer modified yarn have a complicated fiber path with relatively lower fiber radial position, larger migration frequency and magnitudes. In addition, it was noted that 73 % of fibers in the finer conventional yarn follow concentric conical helix, which is contrary to those in the coarser conventional yarn. The analyses conducted in this paper provide deep insights into the mechanism of modified spinning technique and evidential explanations on the difference of properties between the finer conventional and modified yarns.

The feasibility of the ENFICA-FC project depended on several key-enabling technologies. In order to minimize the power required from both the batteries and the fuel cell, a highly efficient electrical propulsion system was required, {{in which all the}} components would need to yield the highest possible efficiency. The choice of the propeller for this specific aircraft was more difficult, above all because the electric motor was limited as to the <b>torque</b> it could <b>handle.</b> In addition, the propeller would also have to provide the necessary airflow for the motor, electronics, and fuel cell cooling to ensure that the temperature did not exceed the limits imposed by the manufacturer. Although a designer may be aided by modern numerical design and analysis programmes to optimize propellers, structural and manufacturing constraints can influence the final choices. Finally, the calculated performance would always have to be validated with experimental tests. An optimal propeller has been designed and man-ufactured to be installed on the Rapid 200 FC aeroplane. Static tests on the manufactured two-blade propeller were performed by means of a static test facility. Specific tests have also been performed to check the efficiency of the propeller when installation effects (blockage and scrub-bing drag effects) are included and to verify the real efficiency of the propulsion and cooling systems, with the propeller installed in the complete converted aircraft.
