25|$|The Mansholt Plan {{noted the}} limits to a policy of price and market support. It {{predicted}} the imbalance that would occur in certain markets unless the Community undertook to reduce its land under cultivation by at least five million hectares. Mansholt {{also noted that the}} standard of living of farmers had not improved since the implementation of the CAP despite an increase in production and permanent increases in Community expenditure. He, therefore, suggested that production methods should be reformed and modernized and that small farms, which were bound to disappear sooner or later, according to Community experts, should be increased in size. The aim of the Plan was to encourage nearly five million farmers to give up farming. That would make it possible to redistribute their land and increase the size of the remaining family farms. Farms were considered viable if they could guarantee for their owners an average annual income comparable to that of all the other workers in the region. In addition to vocational <b>training</b> <b>measures,</b> Mansholt also provided for welfare programmes to cover retraining and early retirement. Finally, he called on the Member States to limit direct aid to unprofitable farms.|$|E
25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration).

40|$|Aim: The use of {{external}} and internal load is {{an important aspect of}} monitoring systems in team sport. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate a novel <b>measure</b> of <b>training</b> load by quantifying the training-performance relationship of elite Australian footballers. Methods: The primary <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> of each of 36 players was weekly load derived from a weighted combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) data and perceived wellness over a 24 -week season. Smoothed loads representing an exponentially weighted rolling average were derived with decay time constants of 1. 5, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Differential loads representing rate of change in load were generated in similar fashion. Other derived <b>measures</b> of <b>training</b> included monotony, strain and acute:chronic ratio. Performance was a proprietary score derived from match performance indicators. Effects of a 1 SD within-player change below and above the mean of each <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> were quantified with a quadratic mixed model for each position (defenders, forwards, midfielders, and rucks). Effects were interpreted using standardization and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Performance was generally highest near the mean or ~ 1 SD below the mean of each <b>training</b> <b>measure,</b> and 1 SD increases in the following measures produced small impairments: weekly load (defenders, forwards, and midfielders); 1. 5 -week smoothed load (midfielders); 4 -week differential load (defenders, forwards, and midfielders); and acute:chronic ratio (defenders and forwards). Effects of other measures in other positions were either trivial or unclear. Conclusion: The innovative combination of load was sensitive to performance in this elite Australian football cohort. Periods of high acute load and sustained increases in load impaired match performance. Positional differences should be taken into account for individual training prescription...|$|R

The Eighth Plan attempted {{to address some of}} these problems. To alleviate labor shortages, the plan called for higher income, increased mechanization, and improved working and cultural conditions in rural areas to retain animal husbandry workers, particularly those with technical <b>training.</b> <b>Measures</b> to raise productivity included increased mechanization; improved breeding techniques to boost meat, milk, and wool yields and to cut losses from barrenness and miscarriages; and strengthened veterinary services to reduce illness. Additional livestock facilities were to be built to provide shelter from harsh winter weather and to fatten livestock. More efficient use of fodder was sought through expanding production; improving varieties; and decreasing losses in procurement, shipping, processing, and storage. Pastureland was to be improved by expanding irrigation and by combating pests.|$|E

For this the IAB employment sample was extended to include details about further <b>training</b> and retraining <b>measures.</b> For a cohort of people completing further <b>training</b> or retraining <b>measures</b> in 1986 the authors analyse as an example the effects on the individual labour market success between 1986 and 1990. The access requirements for these measures are reconstructed for the participants of the further <b>training</b> and retraining <b>measures</b> and for a control group. The control group is made up of people who were employed for a short time in the period 1983 - 1986 and, like the participants in the further <b>training</b> and retraining <b>measures,</b> previously claimed unemployment benefit. By means of a hierarchical matching method, statistical doubles are found for about 90 % of all the participants in the further <b>training</b> and retraining <b>measures.</b> On the basis of 985 pairs of participants and comparison persons, event-analytical estimations are made concerning the return to employment subject to social security contributions after a course of further training or retraining or after the period of short-term employment. In addition the determinants of the duration of this first phase of employment are estimated. The results suggest that in the period under examination participation in further training or retraining has a weak positive employment effect for individuals who were unemployed before beginning the <b>training</b> <b>measure</b> if they take up work immediately after the <b>measure.</b> However, further <b>training</b> and retraining have a significantly negative effect - seen in relation to the control group - on remaining in employment. The authors interpret this as a consequence of employment-relevant deficits that can not be influenced by further training or retraining.
