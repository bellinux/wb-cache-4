5|$|The {{series has}} been {{translated}} in other languages, including Chinese by Tong Li Publishing, French by Kurokawa, Italian by J-Pop, and Spanish by Norma Editorial. Ed Chavez, {{editor of the}} American publisher Vertical, contacted the Japanese licensor of the series to request its publishing in North America. The Japanese licensor of the series refused {{to allow it to}} be published in North America, because it was thought that Americans might <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> to it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it {{presented}} casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} other themes in the novel besides {{censorship}} have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment to the general public.|$|E

25|$|Li Bai wrote several {{poems about}} the Emperor's {{beautiful}} and beloved Yang Guifei, the favorite royal consort. A story, probably apocryphal, circulates about Li Bai during this period. Once, while drunk, Li Bai had gotten his boots muddy, and Gao Lishi, {{the most politically}} powerful eunuch in the palace, was asked {{to assist in the}} removal of these, in front of the Emperor. Gao took offense at being asked to perform this menial service, and later managed to persuade Yang Guifei to <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> at Li's poems concerning her. At the persuasion of Yang Guifei and Gao Lishi, Xuanzong reluctantly, but politely, and with large gifts of gold and silver, sent Li Bai away from the royal court. After leaving the court, Li Bai formally became a Taoist, making a home in Shandong, but wandering far and wide for the next ten some years, writing poems.|$|E

500|$|Though {{he liked}} to be called [...] "der Eiserne" [...] (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He {{was one of the}} few Nazi leaders who did not <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> at hearing jokes about himself, [...] "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that [...] "he sits down on his stomach". One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: [...] "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit." ...|$|E

He argued that their two previous attempts to disrupt proceedings would bias the judge, and preclude a fair outcome at that location. [...] "I believe that the judge will certainly remember my clients, and could easily <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> to it, and therefore could not make an objective decision". The three detained members of Pussy Riot were declared political prisoners by the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners (SPP). On March 25, Amnesty International named them prisoners of conscience due to [...] "the severity of the response of the Russian authorities".|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Historically, [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] {{referred}} {{to the language of}} indigenous inhabitants of England before 1066, especially in contrast to Norman French influence after that. Since the 19th century it has been in common use in the English-speaking world, but not in Britain itself (in this context), to refer to Protestants of principally English descent. [...] The [...] "W" [...] and [...] "P" [...] were added in the 1950s to form a witty epithet with an undertone of [...] "" [...] (which means a person who is easily irritated and quick to <b>take</b> <b>offense).</b>|$|E

And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E

[...] Palmerston questioned the presence of Adger in British waters, and Adams assured Palmerston that he had read Marchand's orders (Marchand had visited Adams while in Great Britain) which limited him to seizing Mason and Slidell from a Confederate ship.|$|E
2500|$|Daichi is {{the founder}} and leader of a group of pranksters at school called the Daikoku Hackers' Club. [...] Hot-headed and quick to <b>take</b> <b>offense,</b> he holds an ongoing love/hate rivalry with Fumie {{stemming}} from early childhood. [...] With the appearance of Isako, Daichi quickly finds himself defeated and cast out of his own group after challenging her. [...] While often perceived as a troublemaker, Daichi is tagged by his awkward friend, Denpa, who holds him in high regard for befriending him in the face of school harassment. [...] Daichi is, somewhat ironically, a constant target of Kyōko's antics. He has deep feelings for Fumie but Fumie is dense about this even though she actually cares for him.|$|E

[...] He clarified by saying, [...] "My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point that I make to my own faith, and that is — you must stand up before things {{get out of control}} ...

2500|$|In the U.S. State Department's daily {{briefing}} for Friday, February 3, official spokesman Sean McCormick, {{speaking for}} the current administration, said (in part), [...] "Our response {{is to say that}} while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression {{is at the core of}} our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might <b>take</b> <b>offense</b> at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-nine-year-old Christina gave {{occasion}} to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One {{of them was}} Cardinal Decio Azzolino, {{who had been a}} secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts. He was also the leader of the Squadrone Volante, the free thinking [...] "Flying Squad" [...] movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676 to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to <b>take</b> <b>offense,</b> but this [...] "does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave." [...] As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved. Meantime Christina learned that the Swedes had confiscated all her revenue as the princess had become a Catholic.|$|E
