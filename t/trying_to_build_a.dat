500|$|Following the Mighty Ducks' Stanley Cup run, Kariya {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season. With Kariya requiring a $10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain with the team, General Manager Bryan Murray let him go to free agency. Murray went on record saying, [...] "We understand {{that he is an}} important player for the franchise...but when you are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> team it's hard to have one player at $10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ($40 million range)." [...] It was reported that the team had tried negotiating a longer-term deal with a decreased salary, while Murray told media {{at the time that he}} would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less. With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose (he decided to opt out of his final year, valued at $6.5 million), the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team. Together, they approached the Colorado Avalanche, having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup. On July 3, 2003, the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one-year contracts. In order for the team to afford both players, Kariya took an $8.8 million paycut from his $10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year, marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history. At $1.2 million, his salary was below the NHL average, ensuring that he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season. Selänne, meanwhile, signed for $5.8 million. Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy's retirement, which freed up $8.5 million in salary.|$|E
