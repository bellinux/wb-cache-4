As Beesley later wrote, the cries [...] "came as a thunderbolt, unexpected, inconceivable, incredible. No one in any of the boats standing off a few hundred yards away can have escaped the paralysing shock of knowing that so short a distance away a tragedy, unbelievable in its magnitude, was being enacted, which we, helpless, could in no way avert or diminish." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{talked about}} how the series would relate to the One-Shot, saying, [...] "The short really {{is the basis for}} the series. 's working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short as sort {{of the end of the}} series, the series would be leading up <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> where she gets {{assigned}} to S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but added that [...] "we all agree and understand that [...] going to get tougher if we continue" [...] making the series. The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films, while the second season shows the discovery of the Darkforce (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has ties to Doctor Strange.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} record of Johnson's life {{between the end}} of 1729 and 1731; he most likely lived with his parents when {{experiencing}} bouts of mental anguish and physical pains. After these years of illness, his tics and gesticulations associated with TS became more noticeable and were [...] "commented on by many observers". To further complicate Johnson's life, his father was deeply in debt by 1731 and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. An usher's position became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but Johnson's lack of a degree saw him passed over, on 6 September 1731. Instead, he stayed at the home of Gregory Hickman, Cornelius Ford's half brother, writing poetry. It was there that he heard the devastating news that Cornelius had died in London, on 22 August 1731; later, in his personal [...] "Annales", he pointed <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{as one of the most}} important of his life.|$|E
500|$|Kubicek {{characterized}} {{the fact that}} Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as [...] "an absurd plot twist". He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote, [...] "Santana's plan isn't vicious or mean, it's getting justice. Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it." [...] Slezak thought the {{decision as to whether}} the police would be given Santana's evidence should have been Blaine's to make, and Lynch posited that [...] "a talk with the police" [...] might teach Sebastian [...] "that violent actions have legal consequences". Chaney was incredulous at Will's statements to the glee club on the matter, especially, [...] "Unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushie, the police aren’t getting involved." [...] Kubicek called Artie's anger that led to [...] "Scream" [...] a story arc that [...] "goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song", but Votta was impressed that [...] "we learn more about Artie's frustration in this fantasy scene than we have in 3 seasons". Canning wrote that [...] "as extraneous as the extended [...] "Scream" [...] segment was, the build up <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> was perfect".|$|E

500|$|On Oricon's {{physical}} albums charts, {{the album}} debuted at number three with 29,000 copies sold, behind One Piece Memorial Best, an album compiling theme {{songs from the}} anime One Piece, and pop/jazz singer Juju's third album Juju. SoundScan Japan, another sales tracking agency, found that most copies were of the album's limited edition, with 27,000 copies sold in the first week. The album spent an additional three weeks in the top 50, and left the top 300 after thirteen weeks. After {{the release of the}} band's [...] "Identity" [...] single in August, the album charted for an additional six weeks. In 2011, the album had two more chart runs in the top 300: one in April after the release of their single [...] "Rookie", and one in August after the release of [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu.". These four chart runs resulted in the album selling a total of 59,000 copies in two years. Despite the album being the band's most successful release up <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> Yamaguchi was disappointed with the album sales, as he expected it to sell over 100,000 copies.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Diet Dreams Come True" [...] episode from November 15, 1988 {{has become}} one of the most talked-about moments in the history of show. After years of {{struggling}} to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her slim figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost. Winfrey now refers <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> as her [...] "ego in a pom pom salute." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nothing else}} {{has changed from}} {{experimental}} configuration to experimental configuration, and since {{in the first case}} the photon is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a particle and in the second case it is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a wave, Wheeler wanted to know whether, experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its [...] "decision." [...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E
2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, so when you finally do get <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E
