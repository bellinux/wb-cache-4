Disjunctive separability, neutrality, and unanimity characterize <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> join aggregators. On the other hand, conjunctive separability and unanimity characterize <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> meet aggregators. We show another characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> meet aggregators using conjunctive separability and two Pareto axioms, Pareto + and Pareto −.

40|$|This is a {{pilot study}} of {{substance}} abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin {{and its relation to}} offspring dissociation and offspring codependency. Cermak contends that substance abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin exposes offspring to trauma, that exposure to trauma in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin engenders offspring dissociation, and that dissociation is the process underlying offspring codependency. Assuming that substance abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin exposes offspring to trauma, this experiment tested the hypothesis that dissociation mediates the relationship between substance abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin and offspring codependency. Although it was found that substance abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin, offspring dissociation, and offspring codependency were associated, no support was found for the prediction that dissociation mediates the relationship between substance abuse in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin and offspring codependency.
