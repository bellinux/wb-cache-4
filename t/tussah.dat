50|$|Silk is {{an animal}} textile {{made from the}} fibres of the cocoon of the Chinese {{silkworm}} which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness. There are two main types of the silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the Bombyx Mori, and 'wild silk' such as <b>Tussah</b> silk. Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while <b>Tussah</b> silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk.|$|E
50|$|While Bombyx mori are the {{preferred}} species for creating Ahimsa silk, {{there are a}} few other types of species that fall under the category of Ahimsa silk, which is defined not necessarily by the species of the moth involved but by the methods for harvesting the cocoon of that species.

50|$|India {{produces}} four {{kinds of}} silk: mulberry, tasar, muga and eri. The silkworm Bombyx mori is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations. Silkworms {{are also found}} wild on forest trees, e.g Antheraea paphia which produces the tasar silk (<b>Tussah).</b> Antheraea paphia feeds on several trees such as Anogeissus latifolia, Terminalia tomentosa, T. arjuna (Terminalia arjuna), Lagerstroemia parviflora and Madhuca indica. Wild silkworm Antheraea assamensis produces muga silk, and another wild silkworm Philosamia synthia ricini (= Samia cynthia) produces eri silk. The estimated annual production of tasar silk is 130 tonnes. Production {{of other types of}} silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes (Gupta 1994).|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of Tussar silk. It was of commercial importance during the Han Dynasty and early Three Kingdoms era, about 200 BC to 250 AD. More recently, the hybridogenic species Antheraea × proylei is being bred for <b>tussah</b> silk production. It originated from a natural hybrid between male A. pernyi and A. roylei females, F1 females of which were backcrossed to A. pernyi males. For reasons unknown, it is a case of paternal mtDNA transmission: the mitochondrial genome, normally inherited from the mother only in sexually reproducing organisms, is almost identical to that of the present species.|$|E
50|$|Tussar silk (alternatively spelled as <b>Tussah,</b> Tushar, Tassar, Tussore, Tasar, Tussur, Tusser {{and also}} known as (Sanskrit) Kosa silk) is {{produced}} from larvae of several species of silkworms belonging to the moth genus Antheraea, including A. assamensis, A. mylitta, A. paphia, A. pernyi, A. roylei and A. yamamai. These silkworms live in the wild forest in trees belonging to Terminalia species and Shorea robusta {{as well as other}} food plants like jamun and oak found in South Asia, eating the leaves of the trees they live on.

40|$|Recently, {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} on exploitation of natural materials for modern product development and bioengineering applications. Apart from plant-based materials (such as sisal, hemp, jute, bamboo and palm fibre), animal-based fibre is a kind of sustainable natural materials for making novel composites. Silkworm silk fibre extracted from cocoon has been well recognized as a promising material for bio-medical engineering applications because of its superior mechanical and bioresorbable properties. However, when producing silk fibre reinforced biodegradable/bioresorbable polymer composites, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composites. Besides, sericin layers on fibroin surface may also cause an adverse effect towards biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to silk for implant applications. Therefore, a proper pre-treatment should be done for sericin removal. Degumming is a surface modification process which allows a wide control of the silk fibre's properties, making the silk fibre possible to be used for the development and production of novel bio-composites with unique/specific mechanical and biodegradable properties. In this paper, a cleaner and environmentally friendly surface modification technique for <b>tussah</b> silk in polymer based composites is proposed.

40|$|Background: The flower bug Orius sauteri is an {{important}} polyphagous predator that is widely used for the biological control of mites and aphids. However, the optimal conditions for mass rearing of this insect are still unclear, thus limiting its application. Methodology: In this study, we investigated the optimal ingredients of an artificial diet for raising O. sauteri using a microencapsulation technique. The ingredients included egg yolk (vitellus), whole-pupa homogenate of the <b>Tussah</b> silk moth (Antheraea paphia), honey, sucrose, rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen and sinkaline. We tested 25 combinations of the above ingredients using an orthogonal experimental design.

Principal Findings: The results showed that, although different artificial diet formats significantly influenced the development and reproductive ability of O. sauteri, the complete development of O. sauteri to sexual maturity could only be achieved by optimizing the artificial diet according to specific biological characters. In general, pupae of A. paphia had more influence on O sauteri development than did artificial components.

40|$|Centuries {{before the}} {{initiation}} of formal silk trade with Han China ca. 2 oo BC, silk appeared as far west as the Baden-Würtemberg region of Germany. The use of wild (Antheraea sp.) silks has also been documented for western Asia and the Mediterranean region since early medieval times, but the extent and antiquity of this fiber technology is presently unclear. The domesticated silkworm Bombyx mori is derived from a species native to northern India, Assam and Bengal, known as Bombyx mandarina Moore. It was in China that this moth was domesticated, {{and the process of}} de-gumming developed {{at some point during the}} second half of the third millennium BC. Accurate discernment between silk made from Antheraea and that made from Bombyx sp. is thus essential to understanding the real extent of pre-Han silk exchange in antiquity. Study of ancient silk fragments based on morphological observations is often hampered by poor preservation. The employment of biochemical analyses offers definitive confirmation of silk in archaeological samples, as well as the identification of the silkmoth species from which they derived, allowing a more accurate reconstruction of the nature and extent of early sericulture, and of the long-distance exchange of this important luxury commodity. Recently, a discovery of a silk thread was made from a 21 st Dynasty (ca. 1000 BC) mummy 2 ̆ 7 s hair which was excavated from Deir al Medina by Czerny in the 19302 ̆ 7 s and is presently on display in the Hrdliçka Museum in Prague (Strouhal, personal communication; Lubec et. al., 1993). A subsequent examination of the Deir al Medina mummy has thrown serious doubt on the interpretation of this find, however, which is most likely a remnant of a 20 th century conservation treatment. Nevertheless, evidence for early silk outside of China before the Han period exists, and the list of occurrences continues to grow (see figure 1). In considering the amount of silk or possible silk in mid-first millennium Europe, the Near East and South Asia (for thorough review see Good 1995), it is important to consider what might have been made from wild silkmoths, either through indigenous discovery, or possibly as imitation of inaccessable Chinese silk. Silk is a highly crystallized polymer protein, which at the molecular level resembles cellulose, because of the highly repetitive sequence of molecules which make up the chains. It is an animal protein. Wild silk is biochemically distinct from domesticated silk, primarily due to the different composition and ratio of amino acids between different species. Wild silk is from one of several commercially viable species of the SATURNIIDAE, Antheraea pernyi (Chinese <b>tussah)</b> or Antheraea mylitta (Indian <b>tussah),</b> among others (Lucas and Rudall 968 : 478 - 479; Peigler 1993; Watt 1893). There is a species from another family of moths and butterflies which produces a workable silk, whose present natural range is in the Mediterranean, known as LASIOCAMPIDAE Pachypasa otus (see figure 2) (Lucas and Rudall 1968 : 485; Freina and Witt 1987 : 379 - 380), which was quite probably the source of the so-called silks of Cos of fifth century BC Greece (Leggett 1949 : 56; Richter 1929 : 28; Braun, 1993; Zeuner 1968 : 484 - 485) ...|$|E
