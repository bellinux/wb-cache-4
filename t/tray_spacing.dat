Ten combined variables of <b>tray</b> <b>space</b> (2), impression material (3), and method of tray attachment (2) were used.

One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to discern differences between the dimensions of the master model and those of casts produced by each of the combined variables including the effect of the impression material. Tukey's standardized range test was used to discern accuracy differences among the combined variables. Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences for the dimensions A-B, A-C, or B-C between the master model and those produced by the ten combined variables. Nonetheless, the mean B-C dimensions on casts produced by the ten combined variables tended to be smaller (though not significantly) than for the master model.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{analysis}} of a segmented weir sieve-tray distillation column for a 17. 58 kW (5 TR) ammonia/water absorption refrigeration cycle. Balances of mass and energy were performed based on the method of Ponchon-Savarit, from which it was possible to determine the ideal number of trays. The analysis showed that four ideal trays were adequate for that small absorption refrigeration system having the feeding system to the column right above the second tray. It was carried out a sensitivity analysis of the main parameters. Vapor and liquid pressure drop constraint along with ammonia and water mass flow ratios defined the internal geometrical sizes of the column, such as the column diameter and height, as well as other designing parameters. Due to the lack of specific correlations, the present work was based on practical correlations used in the petrochemical and beverage production industries. The analysis also permitted to obtain the recommended values of <b>tray</b> <b>spacing</b> in order to have a compact column. The geometry of the tray turns out to be sensitive to the charge of vapor and, to a lesser extent, to the load of the liquid, being insensible to the diameter of tray holes.

The present study explores the use of non-traditional optimization technique namely, hybrid Differential Evolution (DE) and Ant colony optimization (ACO) for design optimization of plate type distillation column from economic point of view. The optimization procedure involves the selection of the major plate geometric parameters such as hole diameters, ratio of downcomer area to tower area, weir height, fractional hole area in tray, <b>tray</b> <b>spacing,</b> tower diameter and minimization of total annual cost is considered as design target subjected to operational constraints like flooding, weeping entrainment, quality specifications etc. The solution space of such type of problem is very complex due to presence of various nonlinear constraints and multiple minima. Hybrid differential evolution and Ant colony optimization (DEACO) technique is applied to deal with such complexity. Studies have shown that in general, the two most effective DE strategies are DE/rand/ 1 and DE/best/ 2. However, the former is over exploration and typically slower in converging, the latter is extensive exploitation and thus a much increased probability of getting trapped in a local minimum. To remedy the defect described above and to make DE more efficient we incorporate a stochastic and population-based approach, ant colony optimization (ACO) into the mutation operation. An effective evolutionary operator should use randomness but should also make a direct effort to recombine good substrings of the parents to produce better strings. To this end, DEACO is used to select the optimal base vector of the mutation operation. This selection scheme, a combination of stochastic and deterministic approaches, is a systematic and definitive attempt to achieve a trade-off between efficiency and reliability. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Mass {{transfer}} {{efficiency in}} distillation, absorption and stripping depends on both thermodynamic efficiency and hydrodynamic behaviour. Thermodynamic efficiency {{is dependent on}} the system kinetics while hydrodynamics is the study of fluid flow behaviour. The focus of this thesis is the hydrodynamic behaviour in tray columns, which affects entrainment. In order to isolate hydrodynamic behaviour from the thermodynamic behaviour that occurs inside sieve tray columns, investigations are conducted under conditions of zero mass transfer. When the gas velocity is sufficiently high to transport liquid droplets to the tray above, entrainment occurs. The onset of entrainment is one of the operating limits that determines the design of the column and thus impacts on the capital cost. By improving the understanding of the parameters that affect entrainment, the design of the tray and column can be improved which will ultimately increase the operability and capacity while reducing capital costs. Existing correlations predicting entrainment in sieve tray columns are based on data generated mainly from an air/water system. Previous publications recommend that more testing should be performed over larger ranges of gas and liquid physical properties. An experimental setup was therefore designed and constructed to test the influence of the following parameters on entrainment: 1. gas and liquid physical properties 2. gas and liquid flow rates 3. <b>tray</b> <b>spacing</b> The experimental setup can also measure weeping rates for a continuation of this project. The hydrodynamic performance of a sieve tray was tested with air and water over a wide range of gas and liquid flow rates and at different downcomer escape areas. It was found that the downcomer escape area should be sized so that the liquid escaping the downcomer always exceeds a velocity of approximately 0. 23 m/s {{in order to create a}} sufficient liquid seal in the downcomer. For liquid velocities between 0. 23 and 0. 6 m/s the area of escape did not have an effect on the percentage of liquid entrained. It was also established that entrainment increases with increasing gas velocity. The rate at which entrainment increases as the gas velocity increase depends on the liquid flow rate. As soon as the liquid flow rate exceeded 74 m 3 /(h. m) a significant increase in entrainment was noted and the gas velocity had to be reduced to maintain a constant entrainment rate. This is because the increased liquid load requires a longer flow path length for the froth to fully develop. The undeveloped froth, caused by the short (455 mm) flow path, then creates a non-uniform froth that is pushed up against the column wall above the downcomer. Consequently, the froth layer is closer to the tray above resulting in most of the droplets ejected from the froth reaching the tray above and increasing entrainment. By reducing the gas velocity, the froth height and ejecting droplet velocity is reduced, resulting in a decrease in entrainment. The results from the experiments followed similar trends to most of the entrainment prediction correlations found in literature, except for the change noted in liquid flow rates above 74 m 3 /(h. m). There was, however, a significant difference between the experimental results and the correlations developed by Hunt et al. (1955) and Kister and Haas (1988). Although the gas velocities used during the air/water experiments were beyond the suggested range of application developed by Bennett et al. (1995) their air/water correlation followed the results very well. The entrainment prediction correlation developed by Bennett et al. (1995) for non-air/water systems was compared with the experimental air/water results to test for system uniformity. A significant difference was noted between their non-air/water prediction correlation and the air/water results, which motivates the need for a general entrainment prediction correlation over a wider range of gas and liquid physical properties. Based on the shortcomings found in the literature and the observations made during the experiments it is suggested that the influence of liquid flow path length should be investigated so that the effect on entrainment can be quantified. No single correlation was found in the literature, which accurately predicts entrainment for a large range of liquid loads (17 – 112 m 3 /(h. m)), high superficial gas velocities (3 – 4. 6 m/s) and different gas and liquid physical properties. It is therefore recommended that more work be done, as an extension of this project, to investigate the influence of gas and liquid physical properties on entrainment (under zero mass transfer conditions) for a large range of liquid (5 – 74 m 3 /(h. m)) and gas (2 – 4. 6 m/s) flow rates. In order to understand the effect of droplet drag on entrainment, <b>tray</b> <b>spacing</b> should be varied and increased to the extent where droplet ejection velocity is no longer the mechanism for entrainment and droplet drag is responsible for droplet transport to the tray above. Since it is difficult and in most cases impossible to measure exact gas and liquid loads in commercial columns, another method is required to measure or determine entrainment. Since liquid hold-up was found to be directly related to the entrainment rate (Hunt et al. (1955), Payne and Prince (1977) and Van Sinderen et al. (2003) to name but a few), it is suggested that a correlation should be developed between the dynamic pressure drop (liquid hold-up) and entrainment. This will contribute significantly to commercial column operation from a hydrodynamic point of view...|$|E
40|$|Major agronomic and {{economic}} losses {{are caused by}} inaccurate application of nutrients from ground based spreading vehicles. These losses come from both over and under application of fertiliser resulting from such practices as driving at inappropriate bout widths. This work reviewed current spreader testing procedures; compared the performance of international test methodologies and evaluated {{the use of a}} digital image processing program to perform spreader testing. Methods to evaluate field performance were developed; this analysis of field application was used to calculate the economic effect of using precision agricultural technologies in New Zealand dairy farming systems. A matrix of fourteen hundred 0. 5 x 0. 5 m fertiliser collection trays was used to evaluate individual test methodologies. Results indicated that there were major variations in calculated certifiable bout width between different methods and direct comparison should be avoided. Tray layout within ± 5 m of the centre spread line had the largest effect on calculated bout width whilst methods that incorporated rows of trays in the longitudinal direction were less variable compared to those using a single transverse test. The probability too accurately assign bout widths using different international test methods was analysed, the ACCU Spread (Australia) test method had the highest level of confidence in its bout width calculation followed by the ES (Europe) test method. The ISO(i) (World), ISO(ii) (World) and Spreadmark (NZ) tests were all found to be comparable to one another whilst the ASAE (USA) method had the lowest level of confidence in its bout width calculation because of wide collector <b>tray</b> <b>spacing.</b> A method to extract a wider range of data from spreader tests using a hybrid image processing system was developed. Results indicated that there was a strong relationship between two dimensional particle area and particle mass under laboratory (R 2 = 0. 991) and field (R 2 = 0. 988) conditions. Although transverse spreader tests provided a good indication of machine performance, they did not account for the interaction of the spreader and its operational environment. A method was developed that used the vehicle location during field application and the transverse spread pattern represented as polygons to create field application maps. Initial results showed large variations compared to the measured transverse spread pattern. A wider study over 102 paddocks on four dairy farms showed that average variation was 37. 9 %. An improvement to the field application method discussed is given; this tool used the geographical position, heading angle and a series of static spread pattern tests from the spreading vehicle to achieve greater accuracy in field measurements. The described field application methods were used to assess the ability to execute a nutrient plan using both actual and optimised spreading data collected during field application. A loss of $ 66. 18 ha- 1 was calculated when comparing the efficiency of using current spreading methods to those assumed in nutrient budgeting practice. If a guidance and control system were used correctly to provide optimised field application the loss could be reduced to $ 46. 41 ha- 1. This work highlighted the difficulties in achieving accurate field nutrient application; however, by developing the ability to quantify field performance, economic opportunities could be evaluated. Overall, this work found that there was a strong agronomic {{and economic}} case for the implementation of precision agricultural technologies in the New Zealand fertiliser industry.

Casting an accurate and precise working cast presents the first and very important step, since {{each of the following}} stages contributes to the overall error of the production process, which can lead to inadequately fitting dental restorations. The aim {{of this study was to}} promote and test a new model and technique for in vitro evaluation of the dental impression accuracy, as well as to asses the dimensional stability of impression material depending on the material bulk, and its effect on the accuracy of working casts. Methods. Impressions were made by the monophasic technique using the experimental master model. Custom <b>trays</b> with <b>spacing</b> of 1, 2 and 3 mm were constructed by rapid prototyping. The overall of 10 impressions were made with each custom tray. Working casts were made with gypsum type IV. Measurement of working casts was done 24 h later using a co-ordinate measuring machine. Results. The obtained results show that the working casts of all the three custom trays were in most cases significantly different in the transversal and sagittal planes in relation to the master model. The height of abutments was mainly unaffected. The degree of convergence showed certain significance in all the three custom trays, most pronounced in the tray with 3 mm spacing. Conclusion. The impression material bulk of 1 – 3 mm could provide accurate working casts when using the monophasic impression technique. The increase of the distance between abutment teeth influences the accuracy of working casts depending on the material bulk. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

50|$|Impressions {{can also}} be {{described}} as mucostatic or mucocompressive, being defined both by the impression material used {{and the type of}} impression <b>tray</b> used (i.e. <b>spaced</b> or closely adapted). Mucostatic means that the impression is taken with the mucosa in its normal resting position. These impressions will generally lead to a denture which has a good fit during rest, but during chewing, the denture will tend to pivot around incompressible areas (e.g. torus palatinus) and dig into compressible areas. Mucocompressive means that the impression is taken when the mucosa is subject to compression. These impressions will generally lead to a denture that is most stable during function but not at rest. Dentures are at rest most of the time, so {{it could be argued that}} mucostatic impressions make better dentures, however in reality it is likely that tissue adaption to the presence of either a denture made with a mucostatic or a mucocompressive technique make little difference between the two in the long term.Another type of impression technique is selective pressure technique in which stress bearing areas are compressed and stress relief areas are relived such that both the advantages of muco static and muco compressive techniques are achieved.|$|R

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2015 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Gıdaların uzun süreli muhafaza ihtiyacı, insanlık tarihi boyunca, bir amaç ve zorunluluk olmuştur. Bu doğrultuda uygulanan en yaygın yöntemler, kurutma, tuzla salamura yapma, konserveleme ve soğutmadır. Bütün muhafaza yöntemleri, gıdaların besin değerlerini ve kalite değerlerini en üst düzeyde tutmayı amaçlamaktadır. Ancak gıdaların gerek kurutma, gerekse salamura veya konserveleme işlemlerinde, besin değerlerinde (özellikle vitamin) meydana gelen kayıplar oldukça fazladır. Bu nedenlere bağlı olarak soğutma yöntemi bir çok gıdaya uygulanabilirlik, besin / kalite değerlerinin korunması ve uygulama kolaylığı bakımından en etkili yöntemdir. Günümüz teknolojik imkanları dahilinde en yüksek verimli soğutma sistemi dondurma / şoklama / derin dondurma teknolojisidir. Blast Freezer sistemlerine yönelik olarak günümüzde oda tipi ve buzdolabı tipi olmak üzere iki genel kullanım sınıfı bulunmaktadır. Mevcut durumda oda tipi sistemler ülkemiz genelinde de üretilebilir iken, buzdolabı tipi sistemlerin boyut ve ağırlık kriterleri nedeniyle teknik altyapısının daha zor olduğu görülmüştür. Dondurma teknolojisi ile muhafaza etmenin temel prensibi, - 18 〬C derece ve daha düşük sıcaklık değerlerinde gıdayı hızlı bir şekilde dondurarak, gıda bozulmasına sebep olabilecek mikroorganizmaların çalışma ve çoğalma faaliyetlerinin tam olarak durdurulmasıdır. Bu çalışmanın amacı Hesaplamalı Akışkanlar Dinamiği (HAD) tekniğini kullanarak Blast Freezer buzdolabında akışın kabin içerisinde hedeflenen şekilde homojen şekilde dolaşmasını ve gıda kütle merkezinin ısısını 270 dakikada 100 〬C dereceden - 18 〬C dereceye düşürülmesini sağlamaktır. Bu çalışmayı literatürdeki çalışmalardan farklı kılan özellik, şok dondurucu üzerinde deneysel ve HAD yöntemleri yardımı ile tasarımın doğrulanması ve daha verimli bir prototipin imalatıdır. Çalışmada ileriki aşamada farklı fan motorları kullanılarak alternatif incelemeler yapılmıştır. Bu analizlerin sonucunda toplam debi ve her bir fandan çıkan debi değerleri bulunmuştur. Ayrıca kabin içindeki sıcaklık dağılımları ve deneysel çalışmalarla uyumluluğu gösteren ölçüm paketlerinin sıcaklık dağılımları da sunulmuştur.   Yapılan deneyler ve bunları destekleyen analizler doğrultusunda görülmüştür ki kabin içinde sıcaklık duvarlara yaklaştıkça artmaktadır. En soğuk paketler orta şok dondurucuda bulunmuştur. Sıcaklığın hızlı şekilde çok düşük değerlere düşmesi nedeni ile üst ve alt taraflardaki sıcaklık farkı çalışmamızı etkileyen önemli bir parametredir. Ayrıca kontrol panellerini kullanmadan, uyguladığımız sınır şartları ile çekirdek sıcaklığını istediğimiz sürede - 18 C dereceye düşürülmesi mümkün kılınmıştır. Preserving {{food was}} {{historically}} one of man’s main challenges. The general methods of protection include drying, bedding in salt, conserving and freezing. All protection methods aim {{to maintain the}} content and quality of food at the highest possible level. However, drying, salting and conserving operations all result {{in the loss of}} some contents, especially the vitamins. Therefore, considering the quality and content of the food, freezing could be applied to many foods and this method is easier.   Regarding the modern technological possibilities, the highest level of quality could be achieved using freezing, blasting and deep-freezing where food is reserved safe for storage and later consumption. Blast freezing  is commonly used in food catering and recently, in preparation of 'instant' foods, as it ensures the safety {{and the quality of the}} food product. A blast freezer is an appliance which reduces the core temperature of a cooked food from 100 ° C to - 18 ° C in 270 minutes using 3 powerful fans and a cooling unit.   The main principle of using the freezing method is to freeze food in  - 18 ° C and to quickly  reduce the core temperature. This research aims to use the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods to reduce the temperature from 100 ° C to  - 18 ° C in 270 minutes so that activity and growth of microorganisms may be prevented which causes rinsing of the food. In the present research, the model is designed in Solidworks CAD (Computer Aided Design)  program, then analyzed in Ansys Fluent CFD program. The present research differs from the previous research work and literature mainly by  finding a relation between the CFD and the experimental results which led to manufacturing of an improved prototype. The air supply system is modelled as a closed-loop system while in former studies mass flow rates were given as boundary conditions. However, in this study the air supply system is completely modeled so that mass flow rates could be investigated numerically as well. Furthermore the CFD analysis was validated with experimental studies.   The layout of the thesis is roughly as follows. First and second chapters include literature review in which existing refrigerator analysis, principles, food placement and CFD modeling of fan and cooling units are presented. Third chapter encompasses presenting the purchased refrigerator, testing environment, equipment and data logger. In the next step, a numerical model was generated and transferred from CAD to CFD environment and analyzed in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, production line and prototype are presented in brief. Finally, the results are presented in the sixth chapter.    In this thesis work, Unilab commercial program is utilized to select evaporator and condenser. Mesh generation using  Moving Reference Frame (MRF) method for modeling of the fan and the experimental approach of this study are based on the similar research and literature. In experiments, the model was installed in a laboratory test room. The packages were placed in the Blast freezer in 14 1 / 1 GN <b>trays.</b> Then, the <b>space</b> between back of the model and rear wall of test room was adjusted to be 500 mm, as well as at least 1500 mm for space between sides of the refrigerator and side walls. The test was commenced at fixed 35 〬C as ambient temperature. A package of 1 kg was placed in each tray. In total there were 14 packages weighting 14 kg. During a 240 -minute period the temperature of packages were recorded simultaneously utilizing 14 sensors. During the experiments, core temperature of packages were recorded during a 4 -hour process using data logger. The laboratory is conditioned to ensure the ambient temperature and relative humidity with respect to the tropical environment standards.   For CFD, simplified CAD design of Blast freezer was exported to Ansys and was meshed using a number of meshing methods. In Fluent software, obtained meshed file was imported and boundary conditions were applied. The material specifications of air as a coolant and polyurethane as insulation material were applied in the CFD program.   Consequently, pressure based k-εturbulence model was used to solve for the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Then the airflow analysis and both airflow and temperature analysis were obtained for empty and full Blast freezer respectively.   The research is carried out using different fan motors. Upon conclusion, the sum total debit (mass flow)  and the debit of each fan is given. In addition to debit, temperature distribution in the cabin and in measuring packs and its agreement with other experiments is presented. Based on experiments and analyses, the temperature in the cabin increase as we approach the walls. The effect of weight of cooling air can be neglected due to the high speed of the exiting stream from fans. These fans also avoid downeard movement of cold stream.   In terms of air circulation, the model refrigerator can be divided into three parts: The first part is affected by upper fan. Second part is under the influence of middle fan and the last part is affected by the bottom fan. The research shows that air stream is more dense in middle zone. The reason relates to the fact that one side of the upper and bottom fans are closed; while for the middle fan both sides are open and this leads to stream of more air and cooling middle pockets. Because of the decrease of temperature to very low levels, the difference of temperature in upper and lower parts will not influence our research. Moreover, without using the control system, - 18 ° C could be achieved until we use the boundary conditions for obtaining the core temperature. Validated from the computational analysis and the experimental studies, it is seen that the coolest packages are found to be in the middle regions while the warmest ones are in the upper and lower regions. The highest mass flow rates are at the fan outlet and the lowest rates are found at the fan inlet.   The maximum velocity of 31. 123 and 26. 91 m/s were obtained for empty and full refrigerator respectively. Core temperature reduction in CFD and experimental model were agreeable. The average difference was 0. 694 ° C which is a negligible value and it implies the CFD model is valid. Therefore the prototype production is carried out with the respect to the CFD solutions.   After the prototype was manufactured, some tests according to the EN 16825 have been performed and it is approved that the prototype complied with the performance requirements. Then, this Blast freezer is presented to the market. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
