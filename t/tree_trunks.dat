5|$|Finn and Jake {{venture to}} Tree Trunks's (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) house to acquire apple pie. While there, they {{discover}} that <b>Tree</b> <b>Trunks</b> has {{entered into a}} relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks <b>Tree</b> <b>Trunks</b> if she {{would be willing to}} make apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, <b>Tree</b> <b>Trunks</b> and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and <b>Tree</b> <b>Trunks</b> begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} forages along <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> {{and branches}} {{in a similar}} way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in {{all regions}} fix their own webs to solid {{surfaces}} such as rocks and <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> and boughs, while some other Portia species often fix their webs to pliant stems and leaves {{and on the}} lower branches of trees.|$|E

The shield is blue for Infantry, with the bend taken from the coat of arms of Alsace. The ragged <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> symbolizes the Meuse-Argonne operations.|$|R
5|$|Similar in appearance, all treecreepers {{are small}} birds with {{streaked}} and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> looking for insects.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.|$|E
5|$|The female Eurasian {{treecreeper}} forages {{primarily on}} the upper parts of the <b>tree</b> <b>trunks,</b> while the male uses the lower parts. A study in Finland found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.|$|E
40|$|Drag {{coefficients}} {{of a real}} <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> and the sheltering effects of an upstream trunk on a downstream one in a linear arrangement with different spacings and inclinations were investigated in detail. In addition, for elucidating the change of drag coefficient for an overturned tree, drag force acting on a real tree with roots was also measured in this study. For the measurement of drag force with different inclinations, Terminalia Cattapa and Albizia sp., vegetated in Sri Lanka, were selected in this study. Drag coefficient of inclined <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> has the similar tendency {{in relation to the}} Reynolds number with that of vertical standing tree investigated in Tanaka et al. (2011). For the vertical <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> with rough surface, drag coefficient of rear-side <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> was decreased with decreasing L/d (where, L is spacing and d is the diameter of trunk). In addition, as a result of mutual interference experiment of two inclined <b>tree</b> <b>trunk,</b> the drag coefficient of rear-side trunk decreased with the increase of the inclination. Under the influence of the increment of projected area due to existence of roots and shear force acting on <b>tree</b> <b>trunk</b> surface, the drag coefficient of a tree with roots became similar value (1. 0 - 1. 2) comparing with that of a vertical standing tree...|$|R

5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin pointed downcurved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> and limbs. One species has been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> with their beaks. There are about 219 species worldwide, four recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} or common treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{also known}} in the British Isles, where {{it is the only}} living member of its genus, simply as treecreeper. It is similar to other treecreepers, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up <b>tree</b> <b>trunks.</b> It can be most easily distinguished from the similar short-toed treecreeper, which shares much of its European range, by its different song.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, <b>Tree</b> <b>Trunks</b> (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) is courted by Mr. Pig, but their over-expressive love begins to make many people uncomfortable. The two are separated, but due {{to the power of}} their love, they are allowed to be reunited.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E

5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on <b>tree</b> <b>trunks.</b> The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> when rearing.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and quickly. He ordered millions of wooden <b>tree</b> <b>trunks</b> and logs to be set against airborne forces. Barbed wire and tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system of wooden poles and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E
