The bioecology of theOncideres cervina(Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) inOcoteapuberula(Lauraceae) was studied in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. In 49 cut twigswere analyzed the cutoff frequency, the diameter of cut twigs and sections, twig length, posture incisionsfrequency, adult emergence, exit orifice size, length and volume of the larvae gallery of this species. Thecut twigs period extends from February to March and this species is fit as thick cutter twigs. The incisionsposture number is variable, but the highest concentration is found on sections 20 to 40 cm from the cut, withan average value of 11 incisions. Two hundred adults emerged from 27 twigs, with the most emergent onthe first half of December. In order to complete its development, this species requires less wood volume ifcompared to other <b>twig</b> <b>girdlers</b> species...|$|R

50|$|The living-hickory borer (Goes pulcher) feeds in {{the trunks}} and {{branches}} of trees. A <b>twig</b> <b>girdler</b> (Oncideres cingulata) can seriously affect reproduction by killing back {{the tops of}} seedlings and sprouts. Both standing dead trees and freshly cut logs are highly susceptible to attacks by numerous species of wood borers.|$|E
50|$|Several insects attack hickory {{but rarely}} become epidemic. The forest tent {{caterpillar}} (Malacosoma disstria), walnut caterpillar (Datana integerima), and walkingstick (Diapheromera femorata) may defoliate individual trees or limbs. Sucking insects, including aphids (Monellia spp.), {{feed on the}} underside of leaves, causing them to curl and drop prematurely. The <b>twig</b> <b>girdler</b> (Oncideres cingulata) may seriously prune seedlings and even large trees by girdling the terminal and branches.

The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs. The <b>twig</b> <b>girdler</b> (Oncideres cingulata) attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches.

50|$|In New South Wales {{the most}} {{destructive}} pest to waratah crops is the macadamia <b>twig</b> <b>girdler</b> (Neodrepta luteotactella). The damage {{is caused by}} the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are skeletonised and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. What is used for the borer should also control lesser pests such as white scale, which is common in the natural state, and Macadamia leafminer (Acocercops chionosema). Leafminer poses no threat {{to the life of the}} plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop. Chemicals with zylene or toluene should not be used as the will not be tolerated by the plant.|$|E
