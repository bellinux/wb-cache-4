5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> state {{commission}} includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background While <b>the</b> {{desirability}} of <b>interdisciplinary</b> inquiry {{has been widely}} acknowledged, indeed has become 'the mantra of science policy', <b>the</b> methods of <b>interdisciplinary</b> collaboration are opaque to outsiders and generally remain undescribed. Discussion Many have analysed interdisciplinarity, especially {{in relation to the}} creation of new disciplines and institutions. These analyses are briefly outlined. Still, there currently persists a silence about <b>the</b> methods of <b>interdisciplinary</b> collaboration itself, and the core of this paper proposes a template for such methods. Summary Breaking this silence – by making <b>the</b> methods of <b>interdisciplinary</b> projects transparent – could further invigorate interdisciplinary research. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe authors examine <b>the</b> role of <b>interdisciplinary</b> competences in <b>the</b> {{development}} {{of higher education}} {{on the basis of}} the analysis of their integrative nature, nature and characteristics. The role of monitoring and indicators in the assessment of students’ knowledge obtained through <b>the</b> use of <b>interdisciplinary</b> competences is revealed. <b>The</b> importance of <b>interdisciplinary</b> models by identifying the stages of implementation of practice-oriented communicative approach in teaching is exposed. <b>The</b> problems of <b>interdisciplinary</b> competences are discussed in the context of forming tolerance and minimizing risk-taking in society. Against the backdrop of youth's problems the issue of educational reform is put forward and solved from <b>the</b> perspective of <b>interdisciplinary,</b> systematic, integrity. In the authors’ opinion, the formation of multi-disciplinary competencies, which would have formed the basis of social tolerance, is relevant to present day...|$|R
