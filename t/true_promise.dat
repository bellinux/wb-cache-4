50|$|Uribe's next task at {{hand was}} the Copa América 2007. He was criticized for calling up a younger and {{somewhat}} more experimental squad. Nolberto Solano, a key midfielder, held his state of retirement. Peru started off on the right foot, beating Uruguay 3-0 in their opening match. However, {{they were not able}} to define in goal scoring opportunities or overcome controversial refereeing decisions in their 2-0 loss to hosts Venezuela. The surprisingly young and nimble Bolivian team also seemed on the way to beating Peru, however 2 Claudio Pizarro headers salvaged a tie for Peru. With the tie, Peru advanced into the quarter finals, but not without a scare. In the quarter finals against Argentina, they were overcome by 4 second half goals after being tied 0-0 at Halftime. Uribe was criticized for unstable formations and inadequate planning, as well as giving Argentina too much space and respect. Uribe was heavily criticized for his game planning, however Peru showed <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> against Uruguay and progress was seen under Uribe, the Copa marked what could {{be the beginning of a}} new era in Peruvian football, as they enter the South Africa 2010 qualifiers with high expectations.|$|E

50|$|Harmie (Percy Kilbride) now marries Sam's mother, and a {{party is}} held at his general store to {{celebrate}} the wedding. Life at last seems to offer <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> for the Tuckers amid the joy of that occasion. Unfortunately, a violent rainstorm rolls in as the party is ending. The next morning the family returns to their farm, where heavy winds and flooding from the storm have ruined their entire cotton crop and ravaged their home. Sam, stunned by the sudden devastation, lets Tim accompany him as he searches for the family's missing cow. They find the animal alive but struggling in the swollen river. Tim nearly drowns in the deep water, but Sam rescues him. After pulling his friend from the river, Sam tells him that he is giving up farming and is now {{willing to take a}} factory job. However, upon returning again to his battered home, he reconsiders his decision about quitting once he sees the resilience of his wife and grandmother, who are busy cleaning up what remains of the house and professing their resolve to start over again. The film ends with Sam and Nona, months after the flood, standing together in a freshly plowed field preparing for a new season and a new crop.|$|E
5000|$|Every freeman, therefore, {{who holds}} land {{can give a}} certain part in {{marriage}} with his daughter or any other woman whether he has an heir or not, and whether the heir is willing or not, and even against the opposition and claim of such an heir. Every man, moreover, can give a certain part of his free tenement to whomsoever he will as a reward to his service, or in charity to a religious place, in such wise that if seisin has followed upon the gift it shall remain perpetually to the donee and his heirs if it were granted by hereditary right. But if seisin did not follow upon the gift it cannot be maintained after the donor's death against {{the will of the}} heir, for it is to be construed rather than a <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> of a gift. It is moreover generally lawful for a man to give during his lifetime a reasonable part of his land to whomsoever he will according to his fancy, but this does not apply to deathbed gifts, for the donor might then, (if such gifts were allowed) make an improvident distribution of his patrimony {{as a result of a}} sudden passion or failing reason, as frequently happens. However, a gift made to anyone in a last will can be sustained if it was made with the consent of the heir and confirmed by him.|$|E

40|$|As {{versatile}} {{drug delivery}} systems, polymeric micelles have demonstrated particular strength in solubilizing hydrophobic anticancer drugs while eliminating {{the use of}} toxic organic solvents and surfactants. However, the <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> of polymeric micelles as drug carriers for cancer therapy resides in their potential ability to preferentially elevate drug exposure in the tumor and achieve enhanced anticancer efficacy, which still remains to be fully exploited. Here, we review various micellar constructs that exhibit the {{enhanced permeation and retention}} effect in the tumor, the targeting ligands that potentiate the anticancer efficacy of micellar drugs, and the polyplex micelle systems suitable for the delivery of plasmid DNA and small interference RNA. Together, these preclinical studies in animal models help us further explore polymeric micelles as emerging drug carriers for targeted cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} acceleration in {{identification of}} new nucleic-acid-based therapeutic molecules has provided new perspectives in pharmaceutical research. However, their development {{is limited by}} their poor cellular uptake and inefficient trafficking. Here we describe a short amphipathic peptide, Pep- 3, that combines a tryptophan/phenylalanine domain with a lysine/arginine-rich hydrophilic motif. Pep- 3 forms stable nano-size complexes with peptide-nucleic acid analogues and promotes their efficient delivery into {{a wide variety of}} cell lines, including primary and suspension lines, without any associated cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that Pep- 3 -mediated delivery of antisense-cyclin B 1 -charged-PNA blocks tumour growth in vivo upon intratumoral and intravenous injection. Moreover, we show that PEGylation of Pep- 3 significantly improves complex stability in vivo and consequently the efficiency of antisense cyclin B 1 administered intravenously. Given the biological characteristics of these vectors, we believe that peptide-based delivery technologies hold a <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> for therapeutic applications of DNA mimics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While {{the use of}} mapping in {{criminal}} justice has increased over the last 30 years, most applications are retrospective- that is, they examine criminal phenomena and related factors that have already occurred. While such retrospective mapping efforts are useful, the <b>true</b> <b>promise</b> of crime mapping lies {{in its ability to}} identify early warning signs across time and space, and inform a proactive approach to police problem solving and crime prevention. Recently, attempts to develop predictive models of crime have increased, and while many of these efforts are still in the early stages, enough new knowledge has been built to merit a review of the range of methods employed to date. This chapter identifies the various methods, describes what is required to use them, and assesses how accurate they are in predicting future crime concentrations, or "hot spots. " Factors such as data requirements and applicability for law enforcement use will also be explored, and the chapter will close with recommendations for further research and a discussion of what the future might hold for crime forecasting...|$|E
