50|$|Extracts from T. terrestris {{standardised}} for protodioscin content {{have been}} demonstrated to produce proerectile effects in isolated tissues and aphrodisiac action in several animal species. It is thought protodioscin achieves this primarily through causing an increase in androgen receptor immunoreacivity, meaning it increases the concentration of androgen receptors in cells, causing the organism to become more sensitive to androgens like testosterone and DHT. The mechanism for these effects has not been clearly established, and while protodioscin has been demonstrated to <b>trigger</b> <b>release</b> of nitric oxide in corpus cavernosum tissue, and also to produce statistically significant increases in the levels of the hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in animal studies, studies in humans have failed to show efficacy and its use remains controversial.|$|E

40|$|Long {{circulating}} liposomal drug {{carriers are}} widely used in experimental cancer therapy because they avoid excretion and benefit from the EPR-effect to accumulate at the tumor site while simultaneously limiting systemic exposure to the cytotoxic drug. New insights in lipid behavior have led to such stable carriers that despite increased accumulation, the unloading of the drug at the target site is very poor. This opens up a new challenge to <b>trigger</b> drug <b>release</b> at the target site, while still retaining most of the drug inside the carrier while it resides in the bloodstream. Liposomes are very suitable to design these kinds of <b>triggered</b> <b>release</b> systems, because {{of the diversity of}} lipids and versatility of lipid membranes. Triggers can be intrinsic, i. e. located at the tumor site, or applied from the outside. Intrinsic triggers such as the acidic environment at the tumor, or the increased expression of phospholipases, and applied triggers such as radiation, light or heat can destabilize the membranes of smartly designed liposomes. Creating a <b>triggered</b> <b>release</b> system will always be a trade-off between systemic stability and susceptibility to the trigger. However, sophisticated triggering systems, that combine a trigger with an advanced imaging system, can further optimize the efficacy of targeted <b>triggered</b> <b>release...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} few decades, various nanovehicles have been {{developed}} as drug delivery systems, in which inorganic and organic components are integrated within a nano-object. Upon the application of remote stimuli, e. g. alternating magnetic field, near infrared or ultrasound radiations, the release of guest molecules can be triggered in a quite controlled manner. Herein, we review different hybrid nanostructures which have already been reported for the remotely <b>triggered</b> <b>release,</b> such as those based on (1) host–guest conjugates, (2) core–corona nanoparticles, (3) polymer nanogels, (4) polymer micelles, (5) liposomes, (6) mesoporous silica particles and (7) hollow nanoparticles. Moreover, we also summarize six underlying mechanisms that govern such a kind of remotely <b>triggered</b> <b>release</b> behaviours: (1) enhanced diffusion and/or permeation, (2) thermo- or photo-labile bond cleavage, (3) fusion of phase-changed materials, (4) photo-induced isomerisation, (5) thermo-induced swelling/de-swelling of thermo-responsive polymers, and (6) destruction of the nanostructures. The ways in which different components are incorporated into an integrated hybrid nanostructure and how they contribute to the remotely <b>triggered</b> <b>release</b> behaviours are detailed...|$|R

Binding of molecules uniquely found in microbes—viral glycoproteins, viral RNA, bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), bacterial flagella, CpG motifs—by pattern recognition receptors, such as membrane bound Toll like receptors or the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-I or MDA5, can <b>trigger</b> <b>release</b> of IFNs.Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) is important for inducing interferons {{in response to}} the presence of double-stranded RNA viruses; the ligand for this receptor is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). After binding dsRNA, this receptor activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which are important for initiating synthesis of many inflammatory proteins. RNA interference technology tools such as siRNA or vector-based reagents can either silence or stimulate interferon pathways. Release of IFN from cells (specifically IFN-γ in lymphoid cells) is also induced by mitogens. Other cytokines, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor and colony-stimulating factor, can also enhance interferon production.|$|E
5000|$|Glutamate is {{the most}} {{abundant}} excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses <b>trigger</b> <b>release</b> of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors. [...] In the opposing postsynaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor or the AMPA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain. [...] The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, {{and other parts of}} the brain. Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission. [...] In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development as originally described by Mark Mattson.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{probability}} of vesicle release is activity-dependent, synapses can act as dynamic filters for information transmission. Synapses with a low initial probability of vesicle release act as high-pass filters: because the release probability is low, a higher-frequency signal is needed to <b>trigger</b> <b>release,</b> and the synapse thus selectively responds to high-frequency signals. Likewise, synapses with high initial release probabilities serve as low-pass filters, responding to lower-frequency signals. Synapses with an intermediate probability of release act as band-pass filters that selectively respond to a specific range of frequencies. These filtering characteristics may be affected {{by a variety of}} factors, including both PPD and PPF, as well as chemical neuromodulators. In particular, because synapses with low release probabilities are more likely to experience facilitation than depression, high-pass filters are often converted to band-pass filters. Likewise, because synapses with high initial release probabilities are more likely to undergo depression than facilitation, it is common for low-pass filters to become band-pass filters, as well. Neuromodulators, meanwhile, may affect these short-term plasticities. In synapses with intermediate release probabilities, properties of the individual synapse will determine how the synapse changes in response to stimuli. These changes in filtration affect information transmission and encoding in response to repeated stimuli.|$|E

As a drug-delivery option, trigger-release liposomes offer sophisticated targeting and greater control-release capabilities.
