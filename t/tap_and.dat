50|$|Metalworking <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> dies {{were often}} made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> dies.|$|R

5|$|Having {{lived on}} the 8 Mile, in Royal Oak, in Rochester, and in the suburb Sterling Heights, Black grew up in {{and spent most of}} her life in various parts of Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents {{separated}} when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, <b>tap,</b> <b>and</b> ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs.|$|E
5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines. This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E

25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} standpipe, the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per jerrycan. The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at standpipes, UN-Water reports that in this case users usually have to pay the costs of operating a stand <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> thus in the end pay more.

25|$|After the attacking player {{declares}} attackers, {{the defending}} player chooses which creatures {{he or she}} will block with. A creature must be untapped in order for it to block. Unlike attacking, the act of blocking does not cause the blocking creatures to <b>tap,</b> <b>and</b> creatures with summoning sickness can block. Each creature can only block a single attacker, but the defending player may choose to block an attacking creature with more than one creature. Both players are given a chance to cast instants and activate abilities after blockers have been declared. If the blocker decides to combine defenses, the attacker gets to decide how attack points are distributed between the combined cards.|$|E

25|$|A small flip <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> a short spout is the {{standard}} neck for dispensing cask ale. An alternative is a long spout with a tight 180° turn, called a swan-neck, {{which is designed to}} force the beer into the glass, agitating it so that a fuller head is created. Some drinkers disapprove of swan-necks, believing that flavour is reduced. In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a sparkler, is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a hose pipe. This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer. When the sparkler is tight, the beer is severely agitated resulting in a creamy head; it is softer and creamier with less bitterness.|$|E
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, {{a pint of}} Guinness {{should be}} served in a {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 {{of the way up}} the glass). To begin the pour, the server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of the}} tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E
