He said that no parliamentary sitting was needed until it became necessary <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> the deadline for which was 1 July. Both major political parties - the Democratic Party and the Cook Islands Party - jointly asked the Queen's Representative to recall Parliament, but the latter is constitutionally prevented from acting except on the advice of the Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Schultz was {{the only}} Senate Republican <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> Wisconsin <b>budget</b> repair bill which sparked the 2011 Wisconsin protests. Several Assembly Republicans <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> bill as well.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>budget</b> met {{opposition}} in the House of Lords and, contrary to British constitutional convention, the Conservatives used their large majority in <b>the</b> Lords <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> down <b>the</b> <b>Budget.</b> In response, <b>the</b> Liberals turned to (what they believed to be) the widespread unpopularity of the Lords to make reducing {{the power of the}} Lords an important issue of the January 1910 general election.|$|R
50|$|As {{the price}} for their {{continued}} support, the Irish nationalist MPs demanded measures to remove the Lords' veto {{so that they could}} no longer block Irish Home Rule. They even threatened <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> down <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> in <b>the</b> House of Commons (Irish Nationalists favoured tariff reform and abhorred the planned increase in whisky duty) until Asquith pledged to introduce such measures.|$|R
50|$|School Board {{elections}} {{are held in}} April of each year. In addition to selecting members of the Board of Education, voters also are asked <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> proposed <b>budget</b> for <b>the</b> subsequent school year.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-March 2013, Osterman {{suffered}} a heart attack and remained in intensive care for forty-seven days. As a result of his health crisis, he missed 163 roll call <b>votes</b> in <b>the</b> House. Osterman said that he did return to the House a couple of times after he was released from the hospital, [...] "but it almost finished me." [...] He indicated that he returned specifically <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|R
50|$|LaRocco was {{the only}} member of Congress from Idaho <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for <b>the</b> Omnibus <b>Budget</b> Reconciliation Act of 1993. <b>The</b> <b>vote</b> proved <b>to</b> be quite unpopular in the district, and was {{exploited}} by Republicans in LaRocco's subsequent election campaigns.|$|R
50|$|The FLP {{members of}} the Cabinet were advised by its leader, Mahendra Chaudhry, <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> 2007 <b>budget</b> but Nand was absent during voting.

40|$|Robert E. Lloyd says in {{his opinion}} piece that the library has nothing to {{consider}} but its budget. He said that he <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> for <b>the</b> same reason that he has voted against all money issues, high taxes. Lloyd says that everyone that he has talked <b>to</b> <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> because of high taxes, {{and that it had}} nothing to do with Playboy. He then ends by saying that radical groups have tried to use tax issues for their own purpose throughout history and that is has never worked...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Elections Canada laid {{charges against}} the Conservative Party, alleging {{contraventions}} of the Canada Elections Act five years earlier. This issue, along with the Bloc Québécois announcing its intention <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> unless it contained numerous changes including $2 billion in compensation to Quebec for harmonizing PST and GST and funding for a new NHL arena in Quebec City, increased the speculation {{that there would be}} an election called soon as the Conservatives rejected the Bloc demands as [...] "blackmail".|$|R
25|$|Elected to the Santa Maria City Council in 1994, Maldonado then {{served as}} Mayor of Santa Maria from 1996 to 1998, {{when he was}} elected to the California State Assembly. He served in that body from 1998 to 2004 and then in the California State Senate from 2004 to 2010, running unsuccessfully for the Republican {{nomination}} for California State Controller in 2006. Maldonado was the first Republican in <b>the</b> State Senate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> during <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> deadlock in 2007. He represented a swing district in the Senate and is considered a moderate.|$|R
50|$|Senate decides on {{confirmation}} of judges of the Constitutional Court, {{proposed by the}} President. It often uses this power to block unacceptable nominees and may propose new laws. However, the Senate does not get <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> country <b>budget</b> and on confidence in the government, unlike the Chamber of Deputies.|$|R
50|$|Johnston {{was one of}} the few Senate Democrats <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> Act of 1993, {{which was}} {{strongly}} supported by President Bill Clinton. He repeatedly <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> Balanced <b>Budget</b> Amendment and giving the President the line-item veto, both of which were measures strongly favored by fiscal conservatives in both parties. On foreign policy issues, he frequently voted with more liberal Democrats to terminate restrictions on travel to communist Cuba and in support of the United Nations and foreign aid. Johnston was the only member of either house of Congress <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against a 1995 resolution to allow Taiwan's president Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States.|$|R
50|$|The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) was a {{political}} party in Samoa. The party was founded in February 1985 by the supporters of former Prime Minister Tupuola Taisi Tufuga Efi. At the 1985 election the party won only 15 of 47 seats, but was able to form a coalition government in December 1985 after 11 Human Rights Protection Party MPs crossed <b>the</b> floor <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> of then-Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana. Va'ai Kolone became Prime Minister. While apparently retaining a majority after the 1988 election, the party lost power after the defection of Tanuvasa Livigisitone to the HRPP.|$|R
50|$|Following his win in 2006, he {{was named}} Minister for Employment Opportunities and Productivity in the multi-party Cabinet that was formed. The FLP members of the Cabinet were advised by its leader, Mahendra Chaudhry, <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> 2006 <b>budget</b> and Nand with three other colleagues <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> <b>The</b> four ALP Cabinet were asked by the Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase to resign, which they refused to do, but the 2006 coup took place before any further action could be taken.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> second <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> Conservative MP Bill Casey <b>voted</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> {{in protest}} of the {{treatment}} of the 2005 Atlantic Accord on offshore revenues. He was removed from the Conservative Caucus afterwards. Premier MacDonald later urged all his province's MPS <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> after a letter Flaherty that was published in a Nova Scotia newspaper. 9 of <b>the</b> 11 MPs <b>voted</b> against it in the third reading. After the 2007 passed, the government started to work on a comprise with Nova Scotia to settle the dispute. Many Ontario-based and Western-Canadian columnists have supported Flaherty's budget, citing figures that indicate that the per capital income in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia has improved significantly, at the expense of Ontario, and that allowing the Maritime provinces to keep both equalization payments and resource revenues would hurt Ontario even more. http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/issuesideas/story.html?id=e82635f3-84b8-439b-b639-c1d4a36f72f5.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as acting leader, he {{played a major role}} in the {{adoption}} of <b>the</b> 2007 <b>budget</b> tabled by Liberal Finance Minister Monique Jérôme-Forget, as it was during a Liberal minority government. The Parti Québécois had requested additional funding for health, education and the regions as well as a reduction of the income tax cuts that were planned by the Liberals to be $950 million. The Liberals accepted an increase total funding of $111 million without reducing the tax cut and have increased taxes for oil and bank companies. Gendron and the PQ mentioned that the funding was not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> but only Gendron, House Leader Diane Lemieux and Finance critic François Legault took part of <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> in which <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> passed 46-44 on June 1, 2007.|$|R
50|$|The FLP {{members of}} the Cabinet were advised by its leader, Mahendra Chaudhry, <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> 2007 <b>budget</b> but Datt was absent during voting. Chaudhry {{threatened}} those not <b>voting</b> against <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> with disciplinary action, {{and there was a}} public feud between him and his party leader, Mahendra Chaudhry but the 2006 coup took place before any action could be taken. As Vijay Naidu notes, Datt was in the unusual position of having been removed from government by a coup on three separate occasions.|$|R
50|$|The Legislative Body was {{not allowed}} to elect its own {{president}} or to regulate its own procedure, or to propose a law or an amendment, or <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> in detail, or to make its deliberations public. Similarly, universal suffrage was supervised and controlled by means of official candidature, by forbidding free speech and action in electoral matters to the Opposition, and by a gerrymandering {{in such a way as}} <b>to</b> overwhelm <b>the</b> Liberal <b>vote</b> in <b>the</b> mass of the rural population. The press was subjected to a system of cautionnements ("caution money", deposited as a guarantee of good behaviour) and avertissements (requests by the authorities to cease publication of certain articles), under sanction of suspension or suppression. Books were subject to censorship.|$|R
50|$|The Council meets {{at least}} twice per year <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> country's <b>budget</b> and bills {{proposed}} by the prince's government. Ordinances (executive orders) are debated in the Council of Government, and once approved, must be submitted to the prince within eighty days for his signature, which makes them legally enforceable. If he does not express opposition within ten days of submission, they become valid. The current {{president of the national}} council is Laurent Nouvion (HM, R&E).|$|R
25|$|Immediate further {{pressure}} {{to remove the}} Lords' veto now came from the Irish MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> unless they had their way. With another general election likely before long, Asquith had to make clear the Liberal policy on constitutional change to the country without alienating the Irish and Labour. This initially proved difficult, and the King's speech opening Parliament was vague on {{what was to be}} done to neutralise the Lords' veto. Asquith dispirited his supporters by stating in Parliament that he had neither asked for nor received a commitment from King Edward to create peers. The cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.|$|R
50|$|Böge {{served as}} {{vice-chairman}} of <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee and <b>the</b> Parliament’s lead negotiator on the EU’s financial framework for 2007-13; under his stewardship, the Parliament got an extra €4 billion and <b>the</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> review. He later chaired <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> Committee from 2007 to 2009, {{when he was}} succeeded by Alain Lamassoure. In 2010, he drafted the Parliament’s legislative bill on the extra financing needs of €1.4 billion for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Also in 2010, he joined the Friends of the EEAS, a unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on {{the formation of the}} European External Action Service.|$|R
2500|$|The 1911 Act was a {{reaction}} to the clash between the Liberal government and the House of Lords, culminating in the so-called [...] "People's Budget" [...] of 1909. In this <b>Budget,</b> <b>the</b> Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George proposed the introduction of a land tax based on the ideas of the American tax reformer Henry George. This new tax would have had a major effect on large landowners, and was opposed by the Conservative opposition, many of whom were large landowners themselves. The Conservatives believed that money should be raised through the introduction of tariffs on imports, which they claimed would help British industry. Contrary to British constitutional convention, the Conservatives used their large majority in <b>the</b> Lords <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> down <b>the</b> <b>Budget.</b> <b>The</b> Liberals made reducing the power of the Lords an important issue of the January 1910 general election.|$|R
5000|$|Faced with {{mounting}} {{support for}} bicameralism, Ionescu and Tacu conceded defeat but, alongside Christian Tell and Alexandru G. Golescu, still supported limiting {{the power of}} Senate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> However, they endorsed a bill which, if passed, would have given Senate the authority to try government ministers. Like various deputies on the left, they still resented the distribution of census suffrage, arguing that their bourgeois voters—portrayed by Ionescu's as a [...] "third-estate" [...] backbone of constitutionalism—were underrepresented in the 3rd Electoral College. Ionescu supported a two-college system and found it deplorable that, under the provisions for weighted voting, peasants had a 1:40,000 ratio of representation, and landowners a 1:40. Nonetheless, the Faction, like the entire political class, rejected both universal suffrage and direct democracy, seeing Romanians, and peasants especially, as fundamentally immature for enfranchisement.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, {{in an act}} {{of support}} for <b>the</b> {{proposed}} school <b>budget</b> which was up for voter approval, up to 700 students (much of the student body) walked out of the school. In the previous three years, <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> had been <b>voted</b> down, and if it had gone down again, the school would have had to dismiss about a third of its teachers, including all who were under age 40. [...] In addition to other local activist activities, such as handing out fliers encouraging people <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> up <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> students staged a walkout which the local media were called to attend. Originally, the principal had planned to let students walk only to the back following an all-student meeting, but students took {{matters into their own hands}} when the leaders of the group led the walkout to the front. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> passed.|$|R
5000|$|More commonly, {{the term}} is {{used to refer to}} the Members of Parliament (MPs) {{belonging}} to a particular political party (or coalition of parties) with a large number of seats sufficient <b>to</b> win important <b>votes</b> (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> each year). <b>The</b> largest party or coalition will form a Cabinet—this is the sense intended when it is said that a political party [...] "forms the Government". The Constitution Act 1986, the principle part of New Zealand's constitution, locates the executive government in the Executive Council, which may include ministers outside of Cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|McKinley {{has broken}} ranks with the Republican {{majority}} {{a few times}} in his tenure in Congress. In April 2011, McKinley was one of only four Republican members of Congress <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> Republican <b>budget</b> proposal of 2012. He explained [...] "As it relates to the Medicare, I applaud what Paul Ryan was trying to do, because we need to have an adult conversation about it. <b>The</b> Congressional <b>Budget</b> Office determined that some of the out-of-pocket costs could double for seniors and that sent up a red flag for me that {{we need to look at}} it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result was}} a deadlock. Even before the {{promulgation}} of the Carlsbad Decrees in October 1819, the Grand Duke had [...] the chambers {{after three months of}} unproductive debate. The reaction that followed was as severe in Baden as elsewhere in Germany, and culminated in 1823 when, on the refusal of <b>the</b> chambers <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on <b>the</b> military <b>budget,</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duke dissolved them and levied the taxes on his own authority. In January 1825, owing to official pressure, only three Liberals were returned to the chamber. A law was passed making <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> presentable only every three years, and the constitution ceased to have any active existence.|$|R
500|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} a hung parliament, with the Liberal government dependent on {{the support of the}} third largest party, the Irish nationalists. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked. Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no [...] "guarantees" [...] for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] On {{behalf of}} the AFL-CIO, I am writing to urge you <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> against <b>the</b> Republican <b>budget</b> {{resolution}} for FY 2012, drafted by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, {{when it comes to}} the floor of the House for a <b>vote</b> this week. <b>The</b> Ryan plan is a 2 ̆ 2 reverse Robin Hood 2 ̆ 2 approach to federal budgeting that would constitute the single largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in U. S. history, according to <b>the</b> Center on <b>Budget</b> and Policy Priorities, and increase economic inequality and poverty more than any other piece of legislation in modern times, and perhaps in U. S. history...|$|R
5000|$|Brünings first {{official}} act was {{to introduce a}} budget calling for steep spending cuts and steep tax increases. When <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> was defeated in July 1930, Brüning arranged for Hindenburg to sign <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> into law by invoking Article 48. [...] When <b>the</b> Reichstag <b>voted</b> <b>to</b> repeal <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> Brüning had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag, just two years into its mandate, and reapprove <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> through <b>the</b> Article 48 mechanism. In the September 1930 elections the Nazis achieved an electoral breakthrough, gaining 17 percent of <b>the</b> <b>vote,</b> up from 2 percent in 1928.

They supported Joseph Degérando’s Société pour l’Amélioration de l’Enseignement Élémentaire (est. 1815) and they arranged at Anzin for night-school instruction for workers using courses designed by Charles Dupin. In Paris, they supported the practical education programs provided by the École Spéciale de Commerce, founded in 1816, and the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures established in 1828.

In his veto message, Cooper cited <b>the</b> <b>budget’s</b> income tax cuts and argued it “lacks structural integrity by failing to account for population growth, inflation and looming federal reductions, by using one-time revenue for recurring expenses, and by adopting a tax plan that will cause the state to fail to fund promised teacher salary increases in future years” and the proposed bill included [...] "provisions that infringe upon the governor’s ability to faithfully execute the laws, including the administration of this Act, {{as required by the}} Constitution, and violating the separation of powers.” <b>The</b> Republican-majority legislature <b>voted</b> <b>to</b> override <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> veto <b>the</b> next day.|$|R
