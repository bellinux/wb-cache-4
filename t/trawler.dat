5|$|HMT Richard Bacon was a British Castle class naval <b>trawler</b> {{completed}} in 1918. She served through both world wars under two different names and {{also had a}} lengthy career as a civilian fishing <b>trawler.</b> For a short while, she functioned as a support vessel for a famous transatlantic flight {{by a group of}} Italian bombers. She was scrapped in 1954 after her boiler failed during a storm.|$|E
5|$|The Rudyard Kipling was the 27th {{merchant}} ship, the 26th British merchant ship, and {{the second}} British <b>trawler</b> to be sunk by a German U-boat in World War II.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1939, Bradman had a Royal Navy ship named after him. Built as a fishing <b>trawler</b> in 1936, the HMS Bradman {{was taken over}} by the Admiralty in 1939, but was sunk by German {{aircraft}} the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Shrimp <b>Trawlers</b> {{are used}} to catch shrimp using the shrimp-trawling method. However, shrimp <b>trawlers</b> only account for a very small portion of <b>trawlers</b> in Hong Kong. Currently, the most common <b>trawlers</b> in Hong Kong, are the Hang <b>Trawlers,</b> Sten <b>Trawlers,</b> Purse Seniers and Gill-Netters. [...] All of these local fishing boat junks were {{mechanized}} only after the Pacific War.|$|R
25|$|Freezer <b>trawlers</b> – The {{majority}} of <b>trawlers</b> operating on high sea waters are freezer <b>trawlers.</b> They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, {{allowing them to}} stay at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size <b>trawlers,</b> with the same general arrangement as stern or side <b>trawlers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Stern <b>trawlers</b> – have trawls {{which are}} {{deployed}} and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern <b>trawlers</b> {{often have a}} ramp, though pelagic and small stern <b>trawlers</b> are often designed without a ramp. Stern <b>trawlers</b> are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair <b>trawlers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hull City and Grimsby Town {{were the}} only two {{professional}} teams which had official permission to play league football on Christmas Day because of the demands of the fish trade, but that tradition has now disappeared following the dramatic reduction of their <b>trawler</b> fleets in recent years.|$|E
5|$|U-43 {{finally found}} success on 21 June when she {{attacked}} Convoy 65-X south-west of Figueira da Foz, Portugal, hitting the 8,627 ton British tanker Yarraville {{with a single}} torpedo. The ship caught fire and sank. Five crew members were killed, the 45 survivors were {{picked up by a}} French <b>trawler.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blunt-Lytton {{documented}} her {{attempts in}} the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel {{as seen in the}} portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy <b>Trawler</b> Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style.|$|E
50|$|There {{were also}} 215 <b>trawlers</b> of no {{specific}} class These were commercial <b>trawlers</b> {{taken over by}} the Admiralty. The Royal Navy classified requisitioned <b>trawlers</b> by manufacturer, although such classes were more diverse than traditional naval classifications. Seventy-two requisitioned <b>trawlers</b> were lost.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of <b>trawlers</b> {{operating on the}} high seas are freezer <b>trawlers.</b> They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size <b>trawlers,</b> with the same general arrangement as stern or side <b>trawlers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Otter <b>trawlers</b> {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each {{regulated}} {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large <b>trawlers</b> usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some <b>trawlers</b> tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter <b>trawlers</b> are also outrigger <b>trawlers</b> (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|R
5|$|By March, {{the newly}} {{converted}} submarine had begun laying mines off the French coast. The French Navy <b>trawler</b> Elisabeth struck one of UB-12s mines off Calais on 13 March and sank. Five days later, the British auxiliary minesweeper Duchess of Montrose sank {{with a loss}} of 12 men after detonating a mine laid by UB-12 off Gravelines.|$|E
5|$|Enemy naval {{targets were}} {{not subject to}} the prize regulations, so on 23 September, Wenninger torpedoed and sank the , a <b>trawler</b> of the French Navy off the Dyck lightship. There was only one {{survivor}} from the 303-ton ship's eighteen-man crew. Three months later, Wenninger misidentified the 74-ton French fishing ship Jesus Maria as a destroyer. UB-17 launched a torpedo which struck the ship and killed all six men of Jesus Marias crew.|$|E
5|$|Following {{completion}} and registration, the Rudyard Kipling began fishing {{off of the}} coast of Ireland and Great Britain. In May 1934, the <b>trawler</b> was sold to The Sun Steam Trawling Co Ltd. On 10 May, her registry from Hull was closed and on 16 May, she was registered in the English port town of Fleetwood, where her new owners were based. The Rudyard Kipling remained with the Sun Steam Trawling Co Ltd. {{for the rest of}} her career.|$|E
2500|$|Stern <b>trawlers</b> have trawls {{which are}} {{deployed}} and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern <b>trawlers</b> {{often have a}} ramp, though pelagic and small stern <b>trawlers</b> are often designed without a ramp. Stern <b>trawlers</b> are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair <b>trawlers.</b> The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards.|$|R
25|$|Pair <b>trawlers</b> are <b>trawlers</b> which operate {{together}} towing {{a single}} trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair <b>trawlers</b> operate both midwater and bottom trawls.|$|R
50|$|Naval <b>trawlers</b> were <b>trawlers</b> {{purpose built}} to Admiralty {{specification}} {{to operate as}} minesweepers and/or anti-submarine boats.|$|R
5|$|Grenade {{was then}} {{transferred}} to the English Channel and collided with the anti-submarine <b>trawler</b> Clayton Wyke on 14 May in heavy fog. Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During {{the initial stages of}} the evacuation from Dunkirk the ship provided cover {{in the northern part of}} the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. Grenade was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The <b>trawler</b> John Cattling towed Grenade over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, {{the ship}} and her crew were {{featured}} in a James Cagney film for Warner Brothers, Here Comes the Navy, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, Arizona collided with a fishing <b>trawler,</b> Umatilla, that was under tow by another <b>trawler</b> off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard the Umatilla {{were killed in the}} collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with Arizona as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Lorient for {{the final}} time on 27 February 1941, U-37s last patrol {{took her to the}} waters south of Iceland. There she sank two vessels, the Greek cargo ship Mentor on 7 March, and the Icelandic <b>trawler</b> Pétursey on the 12th. After {{spending}} 24 days at sea, U-37 entered the port of Kiel on 22 March.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 10 February British United <b>Trawlers</b> had alerted their insurance company, UK <b>Trawlers</b> Mutual that Gaul had failed to report for two days. On the following morning the insurance company sent out a message to all the <b>trawlers</b> they insured reading ...|$|R

5|$|The Aberdeen <b>trawler</b> Ben Doran A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3miles {{northwest}} of Papa Stour, {{on the evening}} of 28 March 1930 while {{on her way to the}} village of Scalloway to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing <b>trawler</b> saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} the ship was {{purchased}} by South Africa and was converted into a survey ship in 1949. Protea was obsolete by the late 1950s and was placed in reserve in 1957. The ship was sold in 1962 and was converted into a fishing <b>trawler</b> {{with the name of}} Justin. The company subsequently failed and she was scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing <b>trawler</b> 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy. The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{processing}} ships {{consist of}} various types, including freezer <b>trawlers,</b> longline factory vessels, purse seine freezer vessels, stern <b>trawlers</b> and squid jiggers.|$|R
50|$|Armed <b>trawlers</b> {{were also}} used to defend fishing groups from enemy {{aircraft}} or submarines. The smallest civilian <b>trawlers</b> were converted to danlayers.|$|R
5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were picked up in the morning by a British <b>trawler</b> and returned to the UK. In the meantime, the master of the ship was able to keep West Honaker in the convoy headed to Utah beach.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a <b>trawler,</b> the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the <b>trawler</b> from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Orsborne {{worked as}} mate on a <b>trawler</b> which formed part of Britain's anti-invasion force, before rejoining the Royal Navy. His wartime {{exploits}} included {{service as a}} beachmaster during the Normandy landings of June 1944, a spell as a commando in Combined Operations, and service in the Far East, where he records being captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In September 1947 Orsborne {{was one of two}} men rescued in mid-Atlantic from the abandoned ketch Lovely Lady; the other was a stowaway, a Spanish greengrocer.|$|E
