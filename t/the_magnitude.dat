30|$|For tsunami {{earthquakes}} {{such as the}} 1992 Nicaragua earthquake (Kanamori and Kikuchi, 1993), the low-frequency {{component is}} more dominant than in normal earthquakes. <b>The</b> displacement <b>magnitude</b> is {{more sensitive to the}} low-frequency component than is <b>the</b> velocity <b>magnitude.</b> <b>The</b> displacement <b>magnitude</b> is thus preferable for tsunami warnings. <b>The</b> displacement <b>magnitude</b> is mainly examined in the following sections.|$|R
30|$|In MSE, the {{embedded}} VAD process uses <b>the</b> logarithmic <b>magnitude</b> spectrum {{rather than}} <b>the</b> linear <b>magnitude</b> spectrum. According to the discussions in Section ‘Effect of additive noise to the linear and logarithmic magnitude spectrum {{of a speech}} signal’, <b>the</b> logarithmic <b>magnitude</b> spectrum is less vulnerable to noise in speech frames, and its temporal-domain sequence exhibits a wider (modulation) spectral bandwidth in speech portions than in non-speech portions. Based on these two characteristics, <b>the</b> logarithmic <b>magnitude</b> spectrum is a more appropriate VAD indicator than <b>the</b> linear <b>magnitude</b> spectrum. <b>The</b> experimental results shown later will reveal that <b>the</b> logarithmic <b>magnitude</b> spectrum outperforms <b>the</b> linear <b>magnitude</b> spectrum for providing MSE with better recognition accuracy.|$|R
