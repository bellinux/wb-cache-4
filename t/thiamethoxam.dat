5|$|Neonicotinoid {{pesticides}} may impair {{the ability}} of bees to navigate. Bees exposed to low levels of <b>thiamethoxam</b> {{were less likely to}} return to their colony, to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony's survival.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and <b>Thiamethoxam.</b> From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{professional}} beekeepers {{and environmentalists}} jointly {{filed a lawsuit}} against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asks for suspension of clothianidin and <b>thiamethoxam.</b> The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives. The EPA responded to the suit by issuing a report blaming the Varroa mite for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and <b>thiamethoxam.</b> Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees are {{in danger}} in many {{developed}} countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and <b>thiamethoxam)</b> presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on B. terrestris showed that [...] "field-realistic" [...] levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a [...] "considerable negative effect" [...] on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.|$|E
500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental {{results show that the}} environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another neonicotinoid, <b>thiamethoxam,</b> causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in another}} study, {{following}} chronic exposure to field-realistic {{levels of the}} neonicotinoid pesticide <b>thiamethoxam,</b> colony weight gain was not affected, nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced. Low levels of neonicotinoids can {{reduce the number of}} bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees' brains. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function [...] "particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks." [...] A study on B. terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate. Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid. Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen, they took a longer amount of time doing so.|$|E
500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question {{of what was going on}} when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and <b>thiamethoxam</b> for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{hypotheses}} were wildly different, including environmental change-related stresses, malnutrition, pathogens (i.e., disease including Israel acute paralysis virus), mites, or {{the class of}} pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which include imidacloprid, clothianidin, and <b>thiamethoxam.</b> Unproven and less credible theories include radiation from cellular phones or other man-made devices, ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiamethoxam</b> was {{developed}} by Syngenta; a patent dispute arose with Bayer which already had patents covering other neonicotinoids including imidacloprid. In 2002 the dispute was settled, with Syngenta paying Bayer $120 million in exchange for worldwide rights to <b>thiamethoxam.</b>|$|E
50|$|On September 5, 2014 Syngenta {{petitioned the}} EPA to {{increase}} the legal tolerance for <b>thiamethoxam</b> residue in numerous crops. It wants to use <b>thiamethoxam</b> as a leaf spray, rather than just a seed treatment, to treat late to midseason insect pests.|$|E
50|$|Key Syngenta brands include Actara (<b>Thiamethoxam),</b> Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, <b>Thiamethoxam),</b> Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, primarily, {{imidacloprid}} became widely used. Beginning {{in the early}} 2000s, two other neonicotinoids, clothianidin and <b>thiamethoxam,</b> entered the market. , virtually all corn planted in the United States was treated {{with one of these}} two insecticides and various fungicides. [...] , about a third of US soybean acreage was planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds, usually imidacloprid or <b>thiamethoxam.</b>|$|E
50|$|April 2013 the EU {{decided to}} {{restrict}} <b>thiamethoxam</b> and clothianidin along with imidacloprid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiamethoxam</b> is {{approved}} {{for a wide}} range of agricultural, viticultural(vineyard), and horticultural uses.|$|E
50|$|Nitroguanidine {{derivatives}} {{are used}} as insecticides, having a comparable effect to nicotine. Derivatives include clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and <b>thiamethoxam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{selective}} {{toxicity of}} neonicotinoids like <b>thiamethoxam</b> for insects versus mammals {{is due to}} the higher sensitivity of insects' acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiamethoxam</b> is a {{systemic}} insecticide {{in the class}} of neonicotinoids. It has a broad spectrum of activity against many types of insects.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission {{decided to}} suspend {{use of the}} company's {{insecticide}} Cruiser (<b>thiamethoxam,</b> TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and <b>thiamethoxam,</b> which are absorbed {{through the skin}} to some extent, fipronil is not absorbed substantially through the skin.|$|E
5000|$|Exposure from guttation. The only {{completed}} {{assessment was}} for maize treated with <b>thiamethoxam.</b> In this case, field studies showed an acute effect on honey bees {{exposed to the}} substance through guttation fluid.|$|E
50|$|Neonicotinoid {{pesticides}} may impair {{the ability}} of bees to navigate. Bees exposed to low levels of <b>thiamethoxam</b> {{were less likely to}} return to their colony, to an extent sufficient to compromise a colony's survival.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiamethoxam</b> is {{approved}} {{for use in}} the US as an antimicrobial pesticide wood preservative and as a pesticide; it was first approved in 1999. As of 2014, it {{is approved}} for use {{in a wide range of}} crops.|$|E
50|$|Sublethal {{doses of}} <b>thiamethoxam</b> {{metabolite}} clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) {{have been known}} to cause reduced foraging activity since at least 1999, but this was quantified in 2012 by RFID tagged honeybees. Doses of equal or more than 0.5 ng/bee caused longer foraging flights.|$|E
5000|$|FAO {{described}} <b>thiamethoxam</b> as non-toxic to fish, daphnia and algae, mildly toxic for birds, {{highly toxic}} to midges and acutely toxic for bees. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) classification is: [...] "Harmful if swallowed. Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects".|$|E
5000|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the U.N. {{assessed}} <b>thiamethoxam</b> as [...] "moderately {{hazardous to}} humans (WHO class III)", {{because it is}} harmful if swallowed. It {{found it to be}} no skin or eye irritant, and not mutagenic in any in vitro and in vivo toxicology tests.|$|E
50|$|A French 2012 {{study of}} Apis mellifera (western honey bee or European honey bee) {{that focused on}} the {{neonicotinoid}} pesticide <b>thiamethoxam,</b> which is metabolized by bees into clothianidin, a pesticide cited in legal action, tested the hypothesis that a sub-lethal exposure to a neonicotinoid indirectly increases hive death rate through homing failure in foraging honey bees. When exposed to sub-lethal doses of <b>thiamethoxam,</b> at levels present in the environment, honey bees were less likely to return to the hive after foraging than control bees that were tracked with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, but not intentionally dosed with pesticides. Higher risks are observed when the homing task is more challenging. The survival rate is even lower when exposed bees are placed in foraging areas with which they are less familiar.|$|E
50|$|Based on a {{risks to}} bee health as {{identified}} by EFSA, in April 2013 the EU decided to restrict <b>thiamethoxam,</b> clothianidin, and imidacloprid. The UK {{voted against the}} ban saying it would harm food production.Agrochemical companies Syngenta and Bayer CropScience both began legal proceedings to object to the ban. It is their position {{that there is no}} science that implicates their pesticide products.|$|E
50|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and <b>Thiamethoxam.</b> From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
50|$|The US EPA {{operates}} a 15-year registration review cycle for all pesticides. The EPA granted a conditional registration to clothianidin in 2003. The EPA issues conditional registrations when a pesticide meets {{the standard for}} registration, but there are outstanding data requirements. <b>Thiamethoxam</b> is approved for use as an antimicrobial pesticide wood preservative and as a pesticide; it was first approved in 1999. Imidacloprid was registered in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Pesticides {{used for}} {{whitefly}} control usually contain neonicotinoid compounds as active ingredients: clothianidin (commercial), dinotefuran (over-the-counter and commercial), imidacloprid (over-the-counter and commercial) and <b>thiamethoxam</b> (commercial). Neonicotinoids can be harmful if ingested. Rotation of insecticides from different families may be effective at preventing {{the building of}} tolerance to the product. Clothianidin and dinotefuran are of the same family. Spraying the leaves using insecticidal soap is another, environmentally friendly, option.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety {{decided to}} {{continue}} to suspend authorization for clothianidin use on corn. It {{had not yet been}} fully clarified to what extent and in what manner bees come into contact with the active substances in clothianidin, <b>thiamethoxam</b> and imidacloprid when used on corn. The question of whether liquid emitted by plants via guttation, which bees ingest, posed an additional risk was unanswered.|$|E
5000|$|Syngenta {{asserts that}} <b>thiamethoxam</b> {{improves}} plant vigor by triggering physiological reactions within the plant, which induce {{the expression of}} specific [...] "functional proteins" [...] involved in various stress defense mechanisms of the plant allowing it to better cope under tough growing conditions, such as [...] "drought and heat stress leading to protein degradation, low pH, high soil salinity, free radicals from UV radiation, toxic levels of aluminum, wounding from pests, wind, hail, etc, virus attack".|$|E
5000|$|Neonicotinoids (sometimes {{shortened}} to neonics [...] ) are a {{class of}} neuro-active insecticides chemically similar to nicotine. In the 1980s Shell and in the 1990s Bayer started work on their development.The neonicotinoid family includes acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, nithiazine, thiacloprid and <b>thiamethoxam.</b> Imidacloprid is {{the most widely used}} insecticide in the world. Compared to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, neonicotinoids cause less toxicity in birds and mammals than insects. Some breakdown products are also toxic to insects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thiamethoxam</b> is a broad-spectrum, {{systemic}} insecticide, {{which means}} it is absorbed quickly by plants and transported to all of its parts, including pollen, where it acts to deter insect feeding. An insect can absorb it in its stomach after feeding, or through direct contact, including through its tracheal system. The compound {{gets in the way}} of information transfer between nerve cells by interfering with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, and eventually paralyzes the muscles of the insects.|$|E
