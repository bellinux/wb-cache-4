40|$|Monitoring {{network traffic}} has many {{important}} utilities {{that will help}} network personnel <b>to</b> <b>safeguard</b> <b>interest</b> of network. Monitoring will help in traffic engineering, forensics, troubleshooting, debugging and traffic accounting. Existing {{solutions to the problem}} of traffic monitoring focused on the placement of monitors across the network in order to maximize the utility of traffic monitoring. The monitors thus placed can provide optimal performance. However, the network experiences dynamic flows and measuring objectives might change from time to time. This will make the placement of same monitors suboptimal. Recently Raza et al. addressed this problem by using the concept of fixed monitors for routing traffic sub populations. This achieves efficient use of bandwidth, and improves Quality of Service (QoS) besides compliance with traffic engineering objectives. In this paper we implement a custom simulator to demonstrate the proof of concept. The empirical results revealed thatthe traffic monitoring approach is effective and can be used in real world networking applicaitons...|$|E
