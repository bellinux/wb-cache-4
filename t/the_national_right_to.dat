50|$|WIC's CTV affiliates, CHAN and CHEK, {{as well as}} CFCF (even {{before its}} {{acquisition}} by WIC), had a hostile relationship with the network, due to these stations' desire to take {{a greater role in}} Canadian program production for the network. This relationship deteriorated even further in 1997, when rival Baton Broadcasting became the sole corporate owner of CTV, and opened its own independent station, CIVT, in Vancouver. Baton, which owned <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> many programs aired in Vancouver on CHAN or CHEK, was able to move these programs, now being advertised as CTV programs outside British Columbia, to CIVT. However, the CTV network, which supplied 40 hours of programming each week, was still bound by affiliation agreements with CHAN and CHEK; these agreements did not end until September 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Nearly all {{broadcast}} {{stations have}} now been aligned, {{in one form or}} another, into national groups based on ownership and/or content. Many of these groups are designated as [...] "networks", in the colloquial sense, below, although in the regulatory sense {{they may or may not}} be licensed networks. However, they are often treated very differently from U.S. networks. For instance, most networks provide a full slate of programming, often, but not always, buying <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> [...] "syndicated" [...] programs that air across affiliates of multiple American networks. Hence Dr. Phil only airs on CTV stations and Entertainment Tonight only on Global stations. However, for historical reasons, The Oprah Winfrey Show (until it ended its run in 2011) aired on a mixture of stations, albeit one dominated by CTV.|$|R
