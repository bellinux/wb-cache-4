5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may prey on {{domestic}} rabbits and guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E

5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to shorten the program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. <b>This</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} it drives the geometry to flatness.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to consider them constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall into a different category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E

These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E
