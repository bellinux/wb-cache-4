Meanwhile, <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy is easy for predication and its utilization has less harm to the environment. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy in China could theoretically supply more than 8. 2 GW, and most of them come from Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang Province. The government of China largely invests the explosion of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy in these years, and a significant progress has been achieved in this area. <b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbines are especially designed to improve the utilization efficiency of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy with low impact on marine environment, and some demonstration projects of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy are currently under plan along the coast. This study is to provide a comprehensive overview of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy in China, including the potential assessment of energy resource, development history (achievement and difficulties) of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbines, progress and challenges of the undergoing demonstration project, and future plan and suggestions for developing <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> farm in China...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tidal {{energy is}} one of the most {{predictable}} and reliable source of renewable energy. The kinetic energy from <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> can be used for generation of electrical power. The purpose of this study was to draw the mapping of extractable <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy resources in Sarawak coastline. The <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed and corresponding power densities were computed through empirical equations. The mapping of potential locations was made by weighting of different elements required for the selection of suitable sites. It was found from the study that only a single site of Pulau Triso at Batang Lupar fulfilled the criteria of the required <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed and the clearance of shallow-draft oceangoing vessels. Off Kuala Igan met only the clearance requirements of all types of oceangoing vessels and the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> speed were found to be lower than set limits. Other examined sites could not accomplish any criterion set for the site selection. It was concluded that the only practicable site for the extraction of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy was Pulau Triso at Batang Lupar among the examined locations in Sarawak coastline. However, only shallow-draft oceangoing vessels could pass through the proposed site due to its lower water depth.

40|$|Characterisation of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site before device {{deployment}} {{is important}} for the marine tidal industry, in order to optimise the device design and accurately predict its performance during operation. Understanding the short-term uctuations in <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> velocity, resulting from turbulence and wave-current interactions, is essential for proper evaluation of the transient performance of a <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbine. Several aerodynamic models have been proposed for the design of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbines and energy production calculation, most of which have proved to predict accurately mean quantities within the ow regime. Unfortunately, these models cannot accurately predict the instantaneous ow variation and resulting forces within the ow regime acting on <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> systems which is of central importance to the tidal energy industry. The reasons for this may not be unconnected to the signi cant differences between wind and tidal turbines. Given the uncertainties which exist in the assumptions of resource modelling and the need for an accurate energy capture assessment at a speci c site, accurate on-site measurements that can predict the ow velocity (and its directional component) at a given location, are needed. This thesis is devoted to characterisation of ow in a typical <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site (the Fall of Warness, of the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), Orkney) through measured data. The high-frequency Acoustic Doppler Current Pro ler (ADCP) surveys were conducted at different locations within this site by EMEC. This dataset allows for the rst time a statistical and thorough analysis of the vertical turbulence structure at the EMEC's <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> test site. Detailed analyses of the directional components of the wave elds using a non-phase-locked method and in uences of seabed and <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> on wave elds, were performed. The bulk turbulence parameters within the <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> were estimated using the variance method. The results suggest a signi - cant effect of directionality and short-term uctuations in stream velocity resulting from turbulence and wave-current interactions, on the hydrodynamics in a typical tidal energy test site. The results from this study can be used to validate and improve/develop proposed hydrodynamic models and can {{play a vital role in}} tidal energy resource planning.

40|$|We {{present a}} brief history of Galactic astrophysics, and explain the origin of halo {{substructure}} in the Galaxy. We motivate our study of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> by highlighting the tight constraints that analysis of the trajectories of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> can place on the form of the Galactic potential. We address the reconstruction of orbits from observations of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> We upgrade the scheme reported by Binney (2008) and Jin & Lynden-Bell (2007), which reconstructs orbits from streams using radial-velocity measurements, to allow it to work with erroneous input data. The upgraded algorithm can correct for both statistical error on observations, and systematic error due to streams not delineating individual orbits, and given high-quality but realistic input data, it can diagnose the potential with considerable accuracy. We complement the work of Binney (2008) by deriving a new algorithm, which reconstructs orbits from streams using proper-motion data rather than radial velocities. We show that the new algorithm has a similar potency for diagnosing the Galactic potential. We explore the concept of Galactic parallax, which arises in connection with our proper-motion study. Galactic parallax allows trigonometric distance calculation to stars at 40 times the range of conventional parallax, although its applicability is limited to only those stars in <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> We examine from first principles the mechanics of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> formation and p ropagation.

Meanwhile, a demonstration project for exploiting <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> energy, supported by the State Oceanic Administration, People's Republic of China, is planned in this coastal area.

It is therefore possible, under the current leasing system, that the electricity produced by the first generation of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> arrays will similarly be in phase. Extending the analysis to lower <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> regions, we demonstrate that these lower energy sites offer more potential for phase diversity, with a mean phase difference of 1. 25  h, compared to the phase of high energy sites, and hence more scope for supplying firm power to the electricity grid.

The Pentland Firth is arguably the premier <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> site in the world and engineering developments are progressing rapidly. Therefore understanding and minimising impacts is vital to ensure the successful development of this nascent industry. Here a 3 dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and sediment transport numerical model is used to investigate the impact on sediment transport and morphodynamics of <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> arrays. The aim of the work presented here is twofold: firstly to provide prediction of the changes caused by multiple <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbine array developments to some of the unique sandy seabed environments in the Pentland Firth and secondly as a case study to determine the relationship between impacts of individual <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> farms and cumulative impacts of multiple farms. Due to connectivity in tidal flow it has been hypothesized that the cumulative impact of multiple arrays on sediment dynamics might be non-linear. This work suggests that, for the Pentland Firth, this is not the case: the cumulative impact of the 4 currently proposed arrays in the area is equal to the sum of the impacts of the individual arrays. Additionally, array implementation only has minimal effect on the baseline morphodynamics of the large sandbanks in the region, smaller more local sandbanks were not considered. These two results are extremely positive for <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> developers in the region since it removes the burden of assessing cumulative impact from individual developers and suggests that impacts to sub-sea morphodynamics is insignificant and hence is unlikely to be an impediment to development in the Pentland Firth with the currently proposed levels of extraction...|$|R
