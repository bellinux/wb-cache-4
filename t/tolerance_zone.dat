40|$|At {{the present}} time in Europe a range of {{countries}} are considering their prostitution laws and looking at whether these should be updated {{in a number of}} ways including the possible provision of prostitute <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones.</b> While this is an issue that is subject to heated political debate, and considerable divergence within Europe, it is not one where there has been much research evidence to date. One reason for this is the concentration in much prostitution research on sexual rather than work-related matters. This paper considers the issue of prostitute <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones</b> within the context of an ethnography of street prostitution in Scotland. In particular, the paper describes street-working women’s views of their work, their reasons for working, their views as to the impact of their work on their lives, and whether it would be beneficial to provide <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones</b> to enable them to work without fear of prosecution...|$|R

5000|$|According to the ASME Y14.5-2009 [...] standard, {{the purpose}} of {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies. The datum reference frame can describe how the part fits or functions. GD&T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired form, fit (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances. GD&T can add quality and reduce cost {{at the same time}} through producibility.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} Taguchi's quality loss {{function}} was {{in contrast with}} the American concept of quality, popularly known as goal post philosophy, the concept given by American quality guru Phil Crosby. Goal post philosophy emphasizes that if a product feature doesn't meet the designed specifications it is termed as a product of poor quality (rejected), irrespective of amount of deviation from the target value (mean value of <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone).</b> This concept has similarity with the concept of scoring a 'goal' in the game of football or hockey, because a goal is counted 'one' irrespective of the location of strike of the ball in the 'goal post', whether it is in the center or towards the corner. This means that if the product dimension goes out of the tolerance limit the quality of the product drops suddenly.|$|E

40|$|International audienceModern {{engineering}} {{systems are}} getting complex and integrate multi-physical objects. The Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) {{seems to be}} the best way to manage complex system design and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) may be considered one of the computer languages to perform the designing of a complex system. MBSE also seems to be a valid solution to integrate tolerance specification into design process. In particular, in the present work SysML is used to create a set of libraries containing simple and complex volumes, primary datum and <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones,</b> according to ASME Y 14. 5 M and ISO 1101 standards. The generation of these libraries is based on the Technologically and Topologically Related Surfaces (TTRS) model and uses the set of thirteen positioning constraints able to represent every condition between assembly features. The paper summarizes the characteristics of the created SysML objects, able to represent Datum, Datum Reference Frame (DRF) and <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones.</b> In particular, the Datum included in ASME Y 14. 5 -M are modelled. Then, all the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zones</b> included in both standards are modelled.

30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of arithmetic tolerancing or worst-case tolerancing {{is that it}} does not follow any trend or pattern within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> and part dimensions resulting from the machining process can possess any value within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone.</b> This results in checking up of each individual dimension for its correctness within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone,</b> which is impractical in mass production. The statistical tolerance overcomes this drawback of arithmetic tolerance and facilitates the machining to yield dimensions according to a normal distribution. Also statistical tolerancing allows some cancellation of variation from normal distribution. Hence, this paper in essence reflects the theme of statistical tolerancing.|$|E

40|$|An {{image is}} never noise free. Visual {{inspection}} {{of a part}} from its image is therefore affected by image errors. Understanding how image errors affect measurement precision is therefore critical for accurate inspection. Existing visual inspection methods either setup a highly controlled environment to minimize image errors or simply ignore image errors. They therefore suffer from limited accuracy and lack of robustness. In this paper, we lay out a statistical framework that allows to explicitly handle image errors and characterize their impact on measurement precision. A hierarchical model is also proposed to model manufacturing and measurement errors. Based on the model, a Bayesian technique is introduced to statistically infer the geometric tolerances of a manufactured part. 1.

40|$|International audienceMaximum {{and least}} {{material}} requirements describe the strictly necessary fittability and accuracy functional requirements for an assembly involving connections with clearances. In the ISO 2692 : 2014 [1] dimensioning and tolerancing standard, {{the writing of}} this requirement violates the principle of independency and is limited to features of size. This paper proposes two complementary writings and several explanations {{for the application of}} the concepts. In order to make the definitions consistent with those of ISO 1101 : 2012 [2] standard, the requirements are defined by means of unilateral tolerance zones. For features of size, the dimension of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> for the specified surface and for the reference is written directly between brackets in the specification. For all complex surfaces, the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> is defined by an offset surface of the nominal surface. The offset value is written between braces. The definitions of form, location and orientation specifications with these modifiers are given for simple elements and for a pattern of holes. Composite specifications, which associate orientation and location tolerance zones with respect to the same nominal, are defined. An example with flutter on a primary reference shows that it is no longer possible to use all the degrees of freedom to associate the subsequent references. The use of an orientation plane to deal with unidirectional chains of dimensions is defined. In terms of metrology, the characteristic to evaluate is the margin between the actual surface and the limit surface of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> when the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone</b> on the references is respected. This margin enables one, for example, to determine a capability. Three applications present an assembly of a mechanism with clearances, a connection with a complex surface and a 3 D chain of dimensions at least material which requires a composite specification...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at the {{influence}} of switching barriers on patients’ private general practitioner (GP) service expectations and <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone.</b> Design/methodology/approach – From 750 questionnaires distributed to a convenience sample, 257 were completed and returned, yielding a 34 per cent response rate. Findings – There was a significant association between switching barriers and what patients expected from their GPs. Switching barriers did not have a significant association with the <b>tolerance</b> <b>zone.</b> Practical implications – Private GPs can develop strategies to overcome switching barriers. For example, they can develop personal relationships with their patients, re-familiarise themselves with the patient’s medical history before the consultation and provide better services to patients who perceive high switching barriers and hence higher adequate expectations. Originality/value – This study contributes to the existing literature relating to healthcare service quality...|$|E
