5|$|Martingales {{have many}} {{applications}} in statistics, {{but it has}} been remarked that its use and application are not as widespread as it could be in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus and other fields such as economics and finance.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> food before.|$|E
5|$|Infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations}} of the Lorentz group appear by restriction of the irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations of}} the Poincaré group acting on the Hilbert spaces of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. But these are also of mathematical interest and of potential direct physical relevance in other roles {{than that of a}} mere restriction. There were speculative theories, (tensors and spinors have infinite counterparts in the expansors of Dirac and the expinors of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> no proven physical application. Modern speculative theories potentially have similar ingredients per below.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they arrive}} at Illium, the crew is {{attacked}} a group of mercenaries including Commander Jacobus, hired by Saren, leaving Tali and Keenah the only survivors. The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try to tell of the evidence <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found,</b> they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Since 2011, {{there have}} been growing {{concerns}} that mothers-to-be from mainland China, {{in a bid to}} obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong and the benefits that come with it, have saturated the neonatal wards of the city's hospitals both public and private. This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups. Other concerns in the decade of 2001–2010 relate to the workload medical staff experience; and medical errors and mishaps, which are frequently highlighted in local news.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{attempts}} to rehire his children the next day, {{explaining that he}} now realizes {{that he is a}} better parent than his distant, alcoholic father, only to discover that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> other work. A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina, leaving behind a box of blueberries. Bob and his wife Linda (John Roberts) discover marijuana hidden in the box and set off to find the children, with Mickey leading them to the farm's location. As they arrive and take back the children, a SWAT team– led by the aforementioned customer, who is actually an undercover DEA agent– shows up and arrests the hippies. The scene cuts to Wagstaff School, where Louise has narrated the episode's events to her class for her report on how she spent her summer vacation.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Steam {{began to}} accept player reviews of games. Other users can {{subsequently}} rate these reviews as helpful, humorous, or otherwise unhelpful, {{which are then}} used to highlight the most useful reviews on the game's Steam store page. Steam also aggregates these reviews and enable users to sort products based on this feedback while browsing the store. In May 2016, Steam further broke out these aggregations between all reviews overall and those made more recently in the last 30 days, a change Valve acknowledges to how game updates, particularly those in Early Access, can alter {{the impression of a}} game to users. To prevent observed abuse of the review system by developers or other third-party agents, Valve modified the review system in September 2016 to discount review scores for a game from users that activated the product through a product key rather than directly purchased by the Steam score, though their reviews remain visible. Alongside this, Valve announced that it would end business relations with any developer or publisher that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> to be abusing the review system.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{call the}} police, who take Mulder with them {{due to the}} circumstantial {{evidence}} against him. Scully performs an autopsy on Amy Cassandra, finding a scab on her forehead. The detective {{in charge of the}} case tells Mulder that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> David and Amy's blood on his shirt. Mulder refuses to confess to the murders, not remembering anything. Scully arrives, saying she found in Amy's blood traces of ketamine, an anesthesic substance that has hallucinogenic properties. The substance was detected in Mulder's blood as well. Meanwhile, one of the officers at the station kills himself; he has similar symptoms to that of the Cassandras. Mulder suffers a seizure and flashes back to his childhood again, witnessing his parents arguing with The Smoking Man. Scully sees Mulder the next day, telling him that she believes that the Cassandras killed themselves after receiving psychiatric treatment and that Mulder was visiting them about their alien abduction experiences.|$|E

25|$|Although {{courts have}} {{indicated}} unwillingness to uphold absolute occupational prohibitions that impose unnecessary hardship and {{have nothing to}} do with the offense, in some cases <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that banning a defendant from a particular occupation (e.g. financial executive) is acceptable since all employment is not foreclosed by such a condition.|$|E

5000|$|At Changcheon-Dong, {{teams would}} observe a {{photograph}} of Miss South Korea, and had to search the nearby streets for her. Once <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> her, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to hand her a tiara and sash, and say a Korean phrase meaning [...] "You are very beautiful". If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the real Miss South Korea, teams would receive their next clue, directing them to the Pit Stop at the Olympic Park. Josie & Alex had to serve their Yield penalty before checking-in at the mat.|$|R
25|$|Doyle and Moeyn {{have noted}} that {{traditional}} methods tended to use anxiety as negative motivation (e.g. use of bad grades by teachers) {{as a method of}} getting students to work. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that progressive approaches with focus on positive motivation over punishment has produced greater effectiveness with learning, since anxiety interferes with performance of complex tasks.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} Wednesday of every month, formal meals are held. Students wearing {{traditional}} academic gowns are lead into the meal hall by a bagpiper.

25|$|The flight {{recorders}} {{were found to}} be damaged by heat but their data were extracted and analysed, revealing no technical failures during the flight. There is currently an ongoing investigation by the Interstate Aviation Committee and others. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that the crew had chosen to fly at minimum altitude over the area. In the last few seconds preceding the crash, the crew attempted to gain altitude. The thick smoke may have led to the choice of flight profile.|$|E
25|$|First, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> a {{difference}} in these letters' vocabulary, style, and theology from Paul's acknowledged writings. Defenders of the authenticity {{say that they were}} probably written in the name and with the authority of the Apostle by one of his companions, to whom he distinctly explained what had to be written, or to whom he gave a written summary of the points to be developed, and that when the letters were finished, Paul read them through, approved them, and signed them.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, Neighbours and Home and Away have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of Neighbours and Home and Away are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> their lucrative niche.|$|E
