40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains and of the nonpathogenic species Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were compared in the phyllosphere of bean. In general, the plant pathogens survived better than the nonpathogens on leaves under environmental stress. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains were greater than <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> total leaf-associated populations of the nonpathogens under dry conditions but not under moist conditions. In these studies the surface sterilants hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation were used to differentiate cells that were fully exposed on the surface from nonexposed cells that were in “protected sites” that were inaccessible to these agents. In general, <b>the</b> population <b>sizes</b> in protected sites increased with time after inoculation of plants. The proportion of bacteria on leaves that were in protected sites was generally greater for pathogens than for nonpathogens and was greater under dry conditions than under moist conditions. When organisms were vacuum infiltrated into leaves, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> nonexposed “internal” populations were greater for pathogenic P. syringae strains than for nonpathogenic P. syringae strains. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> populations of the nonpathogenic species failed to increase or even decreased. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> of nonexposed populations following spray inoculation were correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of nonexposed, internal populations which developed after vacuum infiltration and incubation. While <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> populations of the pathogenic P. syringae strains increased on leaves under dry conditions, <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> populations of the nonpathogenic strains of P. syringae, P. agglomerans, and S. maltophilia decreased when the organisms were applied to plants. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> populations on dry leaves were also correlated with <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of <b>the</b> nonexposed populations that developed following vacuum infiltration.

The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>sizing</b> agent emulsified by polyoxyethylene nonylphenol ethers phosphate ester ammonium salt (NP- 10 PA) and emulsifier 602 had good stabilization. <b>The</b> <b>sizing</b> agent could significantly improve processability of carbon fiber. SEM micrographs demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>sized</b> carbon fiber had smooth surface.
