The Coalition army was outnumbered in infantry but possessed a two-to-one superiority in cavalry. After intense fighting, Coburg's troops repulsed the attacks of the French center and right wing. When Dumouriez found that his left wing was driven off the battlefield, he began retreating. The defeat led to mass desertions from the discouraged French volunteers. In {{the face of the}} military collapse, Dumouriez negotiated a free withdrawal of French troops in return for the surrender of Belgium and Dutch territory. Soon, Dumouriez was plotting against his own government and when his plans failed, he defected to the Austrians, leaving the French army in chaos.|$|E

25|$|According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance {{critic of}} The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre {{critic of the}} Financial Times, now chief dance critic for The New York Times), the Ondine myth {{is said to be}} an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of {{repressed}} virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.|$|E

25|$|The last {{decades of}} Spencer's life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a {{perpetual}} hypochondriac who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose. By the 1890s his readership {{had begun to}} desert him while many of his closest friends died and {{he had come to}} doubt <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> faith in progress that he had made the center-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas Social Statics had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the Liberty and Property Defence League against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of William Ewart Gladstone – largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer's political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, The Man versus the state.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{covers of}} six songs, studio recordings {{of four of}} which were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album [...] [...] "Sectionals" [...] was watched by 8.127 million U.S. viewers, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. The episode's musical performances attracted praise, as did the development of Will and Emma's relationship, though Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly suggested {{it may have been}} preferable to leave their romance unresolved.

500|$|The Croatian media gave heavy {{coverage}} to the battle, repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Siniša Glavašević.

The Croatian government began suppressing Glavašević's broadcasts {{when it became clear}} that defeat was inevitable, despite <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> slogans of [...] "Vukovar shall not fall" [...] and [...] "Vukovar must not fall." [...] Two of the main daily newspapers, Večernji list and Novi list, failed to report the loss of Vukovar and, on 20 November, two days after it had fallen, repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing. News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda. Nevertheless, many people saw Western satellite broadcasts showing the ruined town and Serbian soldiers taking its inhabitants into custody. When the surrender could no longer be denied, the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance, blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia.|$|E
500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Dale Allison {{describes}} the song as an [...] "expression of alienation from the world" [...] and comments: [...] "The disparity between this confused melancholy and <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> religious advocacy on All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World is remarkable." [...] Gary Tillery groups the song with the Extra Texture tracks [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] {{as examples of}} Harrison having reached [...] "rock bottom" [...] in 1975. Elliot Huntley views [...] "World of Stone" [...] as overlong, with the shouted backing vocals [...] "annoying" [...] and Harrison's guitar sound [...] "thin and weedy", and he bemoans that [...] "the melody doesn't really deviate from its beginnings". Like Leng, Ian Inglis gives over much of {{his discussion of the}} song to possible interpretations of its lyrics, but he otherwise writes: [...] "Harrison returns to his view of the world as a place of obstacles and trials in which there is little hope ... The variations in his vocal range fail to add variety or interest to what is, by now, a predictable and cheerless message, set to a leaden and monotonous score." ...|$|E

[...] Whitehead also wrote, even without the iconic superhero, it would be a polished and engrossing game featuring compelling story and superb voice acting. PSM3s Andy Kelly wrote, [...] "Rocksteady have struck the perfect balance of giving you <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> power of a superhero, but with enough weaknesses to make the game challenging; a remarkable feat of balancing and design". Wireds Chris Kohler said that the game's strength lies in its tight script and masterful acting, making what could be a generic game captivating. 1UP.com's Thierry Nguyen gave the game an A−, stating that Rocksteady [...] "manages to combine combat, stealth, storytelling, and cartoon voices into the best digital Batman simulator we've seen to date." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{prelude to}} act 3 was {{originally}} intended for Bizet's L'Arlésienne score. Newman {{describes it as}} [...] "an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments". As the action unfolds, the tension between Carmen and José {{is evident in the}} music. In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Mercédès turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Micaëla's aria, after her entry in search of José, is a conventional piece, though of deep feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and José, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen's favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, [...] "invincibly polite and ironic", while José is sullen and aggressive. When Micaëla pleads with José to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen's music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As José departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind. <b>The</b> <b>confident,</b> off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador's refrain provides a distinct contrast to José's increasing desperation.|$|E

500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I {{have to do is}} think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured <b>the</b> <b>confident</b> plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E
