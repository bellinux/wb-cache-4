5|$|Waddington {{was married}} twice. In 1925, he married Mabel Fawell; {{none of his}} Yorkshire {{teammates}} were aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> married. In 1952, he married Doris Garforth; on this occasion, many of his former cricketing colleagues attended. After a long illness, Waddington died in a Scarborough nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66. He was cremated in Bradford.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> calls from every agent in town, wanting their client {{to be a part of}} the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow {{may have played a}} larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E

25|$|These factors led to {{the shift}} of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, {{and at one point}} there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the {{individual}} taking the coin <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but {{was careful not to}} be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain, and the {{opportunity}} came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave him the money for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled {{by what he saw}} as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found everywhere, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be. Once back in India he continued his Gospel-proclamation work, though it was clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> more physically frail.|$|E

25|$|Kublai was {{attracted}} by the abilities of Tibetan monks as healers. In 1253 he made Drogön Chögyal Phagpa of the Sakya school, {{a member of his}} entourage. Phagpa bestowed on Kublai and his wife, Chabi (Chabui), an empowerment (initiation ritual). Kublai appointed Lian Xixian of the Kingdom of Qocho (1231–1280) the head of his pacification commission in 1254. Some officials, who were jealous of Kublai's success, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> above himself and dreaming of having his own empire by competing with Möngke's capital Karakorum. Möngke Khan sent two tax inspectors, Alamdar (Ariq Böke's close friend and governor in North China) and Liu Taiping, to audit Kublai's officials in 1257. They found fault, listed 142 breaches of regulations, accused Chinese officials and executed some of them, and Kublai's new pacification commission was abolished. Kublai sent a two-man embassy with his wives and then appealed in person to Möngke, who publicly forgave his younger brother and reconciled with him.|$|E
25|$|Cook {{went into}} the Test series against India under {{pressure}} following the defeat to Sri Lanka. In the first Test he scored just five runs. However, as the match edged towards a draw, he collected his maiden Test wicket of Ishant Sharma when he was bowling medium pace. Cook's poor form continued in the second Test when he made scores of 10 and 22 as England lost the game to go 1–0 down in the series. On 27 July, in the third Test against India at the Rose Bowl, Cook scored 95 in the first innings which showed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> back in form with confidence before getting out to Ravindra Jadeja. He {{then went on to}} score 70 not out in second innings before declaring as England won the match to level the series. Although he only made 17 in the next match, his captaincy was praised as England won the game by an innings to take a 2–1 series lead. Cook made 79 in the final match of the series, which England again won to seal the series 3–1. Following the win, Cook revealed he had considered his position as captain but was convinced by his wife to continue. After the first match of the ODI series was rained off, Cook made 19 in the second ODI as England suffered a defeat. They went 2–0 down in the series after losing the next game, although Cook batted well, making 44. He made just 9 in the next match as India clinched the series 3–0. Following the defeat questions were asked over Cook's role in the ODI team. However, the team bounced back to win the final game of the series in convincing fashion, with Cook making 46.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} album, Highway 61 Revisited, {{has been}} described as [...] "Dylan's first purely 'rock' album", a realization of his wish to leave his old music format behind and move on from his all-acoustic first four albums and half-acoustic, half-electric fifth album, Bringing It All Back Home. Documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, who filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour in May 1965, has said: [...] "I didn't know {{that he was going to}} leave acoustic.

In his last letter, he complained about the way German women dressed.|$|E
500|$|Coxon {{struggled}} with drinking problems and, in {{a rejection of}} the group's former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, No Distance Left to Run, Coxon stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> more influenced by American guitarists as [...] "a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [...] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Frakes {{appeared}} as Commander William Riker, and as with First Contact he directed the project. Brent Spiner starred as Lieutenant Commander Data. Spiner {{had asked for}} his character to be killed off in Insurrection because he was concerned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> too old to play the role. His copy of the script came with a note from the production team saying, [...] "Sorry, kill you later". The underwater scene required Spiner to wear more make-up than usual because {{it needed to be}} waterproof. LeVar Burton reprised his role of Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge; a month before the release of Insurrection he appeared in the role in a guest appearance in the Star Trek: Voyager episode [...] "".|$|E

500|$|Converge {{took their}} {{music in a}} more {{progressive}} direction with Axe to Fall. Kurt Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock {{over the last few}} years, and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar. He went on to say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> the [...] "more straightforward, raw punk aggression out in a yet-to be named hardcore side project that I started. So that leaves me free to get weird and progressive with Converge." [...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, You Fail Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E
500|$|In an August 2008 {{interview}} with AbsolutePunk, McKinnon said the band {{were planning to}} start recording once the tour with New Found Glory had finished, [...] "So Oct & Nov." [...] McKinnon said that having Wade, who had previously worked on the band's other albums, on production duties, was {{a way for the}} album to have [...] "A Day To Remember-type feel". Wade also recorded the band's demos for the album, {{in the back of a}} bus. The album itself was recorded at Wade's The Wade Studio, in Ocala, Florida, after the Easycore Tour had finished. Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time, but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record. In September 2008, a demo appeared on the band's MySpace page, entitled [...] "Wax Larry". [...] Documenting the recording process, the band released several webisodes on YouTube, under the name The Real ADTR: Homesick in Ocala, which had been called a spoof of The Real World. The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ, as guitarist Neil Westfall states: [...] "When he [...] was telling us in the beginning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into video stuff, and we were like 'Well that's kinda crazy 'cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us'.
