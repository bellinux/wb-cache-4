40|$|In Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein (1831), protagonist Victor Frankenstein and his {{relationship}} to the creature have often been characterized in terms of creator and creation, with Victor trying to usurp women's procreative role or trying to become God through scientifically giving life.
