50|$|A {{second class}} of divers at {{intermediate}} depths of 30 - 45 m {{which do not}} require trimix sometimes carry a pony bottle for emergencies, as is taught in many deep diving courses. Such second bottles are often 3 litres, and may be mounted in various ways from <b>tank</b> <b>bracket</b> to sling mounting. This second bottle {{can be used for}} argox, if a drysuit is used.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Improvement {{of fluid}} tank cars {{structure}} due to {{development of new}} <b>tank</b> <b>bracket</b> support structures and their materials consumption decrease. Methodology. The investigations to search the optimal design of the support structure were conducted in order to solve such problem. At the first stage patent and bibliographic analysis of technical solutions was done, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} were revealed and new design options were proposed, the most efficient design was determined. The next step is objective function making for determining its optimal parameters, imposition of restrictions, acquisition of objective function approximation and restrictions in the form of polynomials. At the third stage numerical implementation of function optimization was proposed, optimal design parameters were determined with graphical method. Results methods have coincided. Findings. The most efficient design of support structure was determined; its optimum geometrical dimensions were described. Originality. The author provides the mathematical formulation of optimal design of tank car supports using the minimum materials consumption criteria. The graphic and numerical methods were used during the investigations. Practical value. The author proposed the finite-element models of tank car with different design execution of bracket support structures, which allow estimating the VAT of structure...|$|E
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and testing of}} a flame cultivator attachment. The project used existing torches, a tractor, and a cultivation sled to increase the usability of the farmerâ€™s torches. This project includes two torch clamps, two propane <b>tank</b> <b>brackets,</b> and a removable valve panel. Testing showed that the new system increases the safety and efficiency of the torches...|$|R
50|$|The {{failure was}} {{traced to the}} Centaur boost pumps, but the cause was still unclear, thought likely to be either ice or debris. To reduce the chance of another similar failure, pre-launch {{procedures}} to verify Centaur's pumps were free and unobstructed were put in place. It took nearly four years to trace {{the cause of the}} failure, which was an improperly-installed mounting bracket inside the LOX <b>tank.</b> This <b>bracket</b> held a LOX regulator in place and the technician responsible for installing it had found that the normal tool used to screw bolts into place was too short to reach the bracket. He thus used a slightly longer socket wrench which gave him more reach. The technician had since retired and failed to inform his successor about this. The new technician thus attempted to attach the bolt with the wrench specified in the assembly instructions, which was too short and prevented him from screwing it into place properly. The bolt came loose, fell off, and got sucked into one of the LOX boost pumps, jamming it and preventing it from operating. Despite the failure, at least one important goal was accomplished in that the bulging Centaur payload shroud was proven to be aerodynamically stable in flight and had jettisoned properly and on schedule.|$|R
40|$|This project {{deals with}} the Model and static Analysis of Bracket {{assembly}} used in Aerospace Industry. This bracket assembly is used for placing components for various purposes like carrying fuel and air. The mounting bracket assembly consists of a circular plate with nine lugs for which three different tanks are mounted. The individual components i. e., circular plate, lugs etc are modeled and assembled through NX-CAD Software. The loads are transferred by the <b>tanks</b> to the <b>bracket</b> are considered as pressure loads. To reveal the stresses induced due to pressure loads, Finite Element (FE) Analysis is performed {{with the help of}} ANSYS. Then the occurrence of max stress is found and factor of safety is calculated. This project provides a methodology for analysis of an assembly consisting of components made of composite materials and metal components...|$|R
