40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the level of relevance of the economic development and the level of pollution of thirteen states that joined the European Union (EU) in the last three enlargement rounds (2004, 2007, and 2013), with <b>the</b> length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> number of regulations that have agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> <b>The</b> initial assumption is that the level of economic development of countries joining the EU and the level of pollution are affecting <b>the</b> length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and <b>the</b> number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> Accordingly, <b>the</b> paper points to the level of economic development (measured by GDP) and the level of pollution (emissions measured by CO 2 /pc and CO 2 /gdp). All the states are grouped into five regional groups (Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Baltics, South-East Europe and the member states of the former Yugoslavia). Separate part of the paper analyzes in detail the types of regulations relating to <b>the</b> agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> and <b>the</b> number and length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> that are contracted by the states of the five groups. For the analysis we used <b>the</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> in <b>the</b> field of energy, environment and transport, given their potential importance for CO 2 emissions. The final part of the paper analyses perceived relevance between the level of economic development, levels of pollution, <b>the</b> length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and <b>the</b> number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control {{over a five-year period}} and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced <b>the</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after <b>the</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> were braced with bilateral symmetry.|$|E
5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in <b>the</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E
