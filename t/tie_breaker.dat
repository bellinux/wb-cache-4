5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the <b>tie</b> <b>breaker</b> reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E

Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match <b>tie</b> <b>breaker,</b> {{which took place}} at one set all.

25|$|The {{school with}} the most {{aggregate}} points {{at the end of}} the week is the winner, progressing to the semi-finals and then the Grand Final. The winning school on any one day does not compete for more points or prizes, and should there be a tie it need not be broken. However, should there be a tie after the week, a <b>tie</b> <b>breaker</b> would be given out for the Friday's teams. The team that gives the correct answer gets 10 points for their team and go through to the next round. An incorrect answer would lose them 10 points and the opposing team go through instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot so they can get involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a <b>tie</b> <b>breaker</b> in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E

Needing only a win in Game #161 against Milwaukee on October 1, St. Louis lost 5-3, but the Astros had already lost 3-1 at Atlanta. The Cardinals had narrowly avoided collapse and won the NL Central with an 83-78 record.

[...] They are sometimes used in the case for when money or prizes are being distributed to the winners of the competition, and a <b>tie</b> <b>breaker</b> will be used even if both students have a perfect score. [...] Tie-breakers are conducted according to the [...] "sudden death" [...] method. [...] For example, in a tie-breaker, if student A scored the same as student B, and each missed 1 question, the student who missed question #5 will win over the student who missed question #3; students who start missing questions last are ranked higher, given same scores. [...] If the sudden death method doesn't resolve the tie, in other words both students have exactly the same answers, then a tie-breaker question is made and the person to turn in the correct answer the fastest wins the tie. [...] If both get it wrong or if both turn in the correct answer at the same time then the process is repeated until the tie is resolved. [...] All students that get a perfect score are considered to place 1st. [...] Due to the large number of students, as compared to a typical high school classroom, who participate in competitions, scantrons are used as answer sheets; their main advantage is that they can be graded by a computer. [...] These are similar in type to the answer sheets used in standardized tests such as the SAT and the ACT.|$|E
