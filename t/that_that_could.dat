5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not have happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
25|$|In his 19th footnote, Blackmun had {{admitted}} {{there was in}} the case a possible reason not to compel arbitration, raised in the federal government's brief: that, since the contract was governed by Swiss law, the arbitration panel could therefore decide to disregard the Sherman Act entirely and consider Soler's claims under that body of law. On the other side, the International Chamber of Commerce had conceded in its amicus brief <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> occur as well, though it considered the possibility unlikely. Blackmun allowed {{that this was a}} valid concern but countered that Mitsubishi had already stipulated at oral argument that American law would control the antitrust claims, mooting it in the instant case.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how they could say <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Schleswig-Holsteins had not {{completely}} {{cut off the}} town, and the garrison {{was able to be}} relieved several times by troops based in Funen, so Bonin decided to cut off access between the two Danish areas. [...] As a result, he ordered two more redoubts to be constructed, of which one was completed, near the beach between Funen and Fredericia. [...] On 30 May, Danish troops launched another sally, damaging what had been constructed so far, and spiking 9 cannons. [...] The Schleswig-Holsteins were not able to completely cut off the town, but the threat <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> still happen prompted Lunding to urge his superiors to launch an attack soon.|$|E

The ambassador describes the event as a [...] "very sad development for those of us who care to see peace in the Philippines." ...|$|E

60|$|When Alexander Abraham {{was able}} to sit up, he began {{to make up for}} the time he'd lost being pleasant. Anything more sarcastic than that man in his {{convalescence}} you couldn't imagine.

60|$|For instance, {{when the}} king began his reign, {{he was very}} eager to have the war for the {{recovery}} of the Palatinate go on at once; and he was, besides, very much embarrassed for want of money. He wished, therefore, in order to save time, that the old Parliament which King James had called should continue to act under his reign. But his Privy Council told him <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be. That was James's Parliament. If he wanted one for his reign, he must call upon the people to elect a new Parliament for him.|$|E
60|$|Mary had not {{expected}} so early an hour to be named. She said it was sudden; and she seemed agitated and distressed. She, however, soon recovered her composure, and asked to have a Catholic priest allowed to visit her. The commissioners replied <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be permitted. They, however, proposed to send the Dean of Peterborough to visit her. A dean is the ecclesiastical functionary presiding over a cathedral church; and, of course, the Dean of Peterborough was the clergyman of the highest rank in that vicinity. He was, however, a Protestant, and Mary {{did not wish to}} see him.|$|E

Why, why, was my desperate thought, why needed she allow the world to come to such close quarters? Why, with so many {{plausible}} reasons given in her letter for keeping poor Mr Crimble waiting, had she withheld the one that counted for most? And what was it? I knew in my heart <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be [...] "making {{the best use of}} the mess." [...] Surely, if one just told only the truth, there wasn't anything else to tell. It had taken me some time to learn this lesson.|$|E

60|$|As I {{have removed}} myself {{altogether}} from all {{association with the}} humdrum existence {{which might have been}} mine, I am naturally friendless for the present. So far as the other sex is concerned, I fancy <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be easily remedied. But no women are likely to care about making my acquaintance, and I am glad of it. I hate women--men, too, I think! At any rate, there will be no one of whom I shall make a confidant, so I have chosen you, my silent friend. I gave a guinea for you in Bond Street, and with your dainty morocco case and binding, I think you are well worth it. At any rate, you will be faithful so far as silence is concerned.|$|E
6000|$|The work of that {{afternoon}} in Percycross proved how correct Mr. Griffenbottom {{had been in}} his judgment. He kept his place {{at the top of the}} poll. It was soon evident <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be shaken. Then Westmacott passed by Moggs, and in the next half-hour Sir Thomas did so also. This was at two, when Ontario betook himself to the privacy of his bedroom at the Cordwainers' Arms. His pluck left him altogether, and he found himself unable to face the town as a losing candidate. Then for two hours there was a terrible struggle between Westmacott and Underwood, during which things were done in the desperation of the moment, as to which it might be so difficult to give an account, should any subsequent account be required. We all know how hard it is to sacrifice the power of winning, when during the heat of the contest the power of winning is within our reach. At four o'clock the state of the poll was as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. The altar was it of {{old that}} was to bear up the {{sacrifice}} until it was consumed; and {{with reference to the}} sacrifice under consideration, the tree could not bear up that; for our sacrifice being a man, consisting of soul and body, that which could bear him up in his suffering condition, must be <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> apply itself to his reasonable and sensible part for relief and succour, and that was of power to keep him even in his spirit, and in a complete submissiveness to God, in the present condition in which he was; and could the tree do this, think you? Had the tree that command and government of the soul and sense of Christ, of the reason and feeling of the Lord Jesus, as to keep him in this bitter suffering, in that evenness and spotlessness in his torment, as to cause that he should come off this great work, without the least smell or tang[25] of imperfection? No, no; it was through the Eternal Spirit that he 'offered himself without spot to God.' ...|$|E
