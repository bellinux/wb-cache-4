500|$|In August 2009, M. Suganth of The Times of India {{rated the}} film 4.5 out of 5. Naman Ramachandran {{considered}} Rajinikanth's Kali an effective {{portrayal of a}} challenging, complex character. He praised Balu Mahendra's cinematography, especially his use of natural light. In December 2014, Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times wrote: [...] "On watching [...] recently, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the brilliance of [...] acting ability. In both, he essays shades of deep grey, and yet there was something captivating about Rajinikanth." ...|$|E

60|$|Sid was all right, Sid <b>was,</b> and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about that.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about Mr. Magnet. Marjorie had {{accepted}} him, whatever else {{she had felt}} or done.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{wide awake}} again, she started up. Yes <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about it! And {{yet it was}} very odd.|$|R
60|$|The {{tone was}} positive. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> it. Her mind was made up.|$|E
60|$|Tom planted himself {{across the}} narrow path in an {{attitude}} which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bob {{shook his}} head, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> {{the look on}} his face as he did so.|$|E
60|$|He {{read the}} note again. <b>No.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> 'Thomson <b>is</b> {{not in the}} House.' <b>There</b> could <b>be</b> <b>no</b> two {{meanings}} about that.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in the pirate's {{account of}} that key, {{and of the}} buried treasure?" [...] asked the deacon, anxiously.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> this time. Letting {{the animal}} go, she fled, red-handed, into the {{innermost}} recess of the cottage, followed by her horrified friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here! Here!" [...] {{he screamed}} out twice. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his astonishment, his shocked incredulity--something like frightened disgust.|$|E
60|$|Before Ormsgill could answer, the old {{man made}} a sign, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his tone of authority.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head sadly and the big tears stood in her eyes. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> her earnestness now.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] asked Phil Jones, as {{he stood}} by, {{watching}} me turn my pockets inside out {{to make sure that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> I say the Republic--" [...] He paused, as if {{struck with}} an idea. [...] "Don't you know?" [...] he said. [...] "Your father--" ...|$|R
60|$|Then he {{suddenly}} stiffened. He leaned {{forward into the}} dark, listening. This time <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> A cry, faint and pitiful though it was, reached his ears distinctly.|$|R
60|$|A glance was {{sufficient}} to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> them.|$|E
60|$|Gladwyne colored {{and moved}} abruptly. He had {{imagined}} {{that she was}} his for the asking, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> her cutting scorn.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the man's sincerity, or {{the urgency}} and {{importance}} of his business; {{from his point of}} view at any rate. I stepped forward.|$|E
50|$|In Halychyna, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a variety}} of {{embroidery}} styles that were specific for individual localities, such that when one sees a piece of embroidery <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> its origin.|$|R
6000|$|Allen {{stared at}} the letters on the rock {{as if he had}} not spelled out the words aright. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> They really read [...] "Barnaby Winthrop's Mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I? It's all right, {{as long as}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> {{about my}} meaning," [...] {{answered}} Lingard, strolling slowly to the landing-place. Willems followed him, and Aissa followed Willems.|$|R
6000|$|... "With the {{greatest}} {{pleasure in the}} world, Madame," [...] he answered, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his sincerity. As he spoke, Mademoiselle {{turned her back on}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... “What are {{you going}} to do with her?” he panted. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the grim trend of {{mischief}} in those flushed by sternly composed young faces.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hair was}} just passably tidy, {{and she was}} a little effaced by a red blouse, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the genuine {{brightness}} of her welcome.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, when I had done, [...] "it is here at last; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about that. And what, may I ask, do {{you propose}} to do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... (Bass' Theorem P) R {{satisfies}} the descending chain condition on principal right ideals. (<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> this condition on right principal ideals {{is equivalent to}} the ring being left perfect.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is most extraordinary," [...] {{she said}} at last. [...] "What can it mean? You <b>are</b> sure that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> captain? It <b>was</b> to Dr. Maddison's house she went." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a meaning}} {{in his words}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking.</b> The old man, looking round at the faces, saw that the mate’s was very pale.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed open}} the baize door. A lady was sitting by Carmina's bedside. Even in the dim light, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> that face. Mr. Null recognised--Miss Minerva.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{took hold}} of the line in front of him, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the fact--he had a big fish {{on the other end of}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> vizir," [...] {{said the}} Sultan. [...] "Remember {{you will have}} to take her life yourself. If you refuse, I swear that your head shall pay forfeit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I'm glad <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in the matter," [...] {{answered}} Clinch, in {{a confident}} and a relieved manner. [...] "I was afraid at first, Captain Cuffe, my signal {{had not been}} understood." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> this time; {{the flag}} was raised and lowered {{five or six}} times. The boys took to their heels and ran and {{gathered}} in a cluster fifty yards away on the hill-side.|$|R
