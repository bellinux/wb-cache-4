5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> could earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{eighteen}} years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half; three-quarters of this growth came in the 1960s and early 1970s. During {{the second half of}} Brezhnev's reign, average income per head grew by one-quarter. In {{the first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> had been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev's reversal of most of Khrushchev's policies. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most of the increase in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.|$|E

25|$|Between 1954 and 1958, {{trade between}} Cuba and the United States {{was at a}} higher level <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is today. 65% of Cuba's total exports were sent to the United States while imports from the U.S. totaled to 74% percent of Cuba's {{international}} purchases. After the formal implementation of the embargo and the passage of Proclamation 3355, there was a 95% decrease in Cuba's sugar quota, which canceled roughly 700,000 tons of the 3,119,655 tons previously allotted to the United States. A year later, Cuba's sugar quota was reduced to zero when President Eisenhower issued Proclamation 3383. This substantially effected Cuba's total exports as Cuba was one of the world's leading sugar exporters at the time.|$|E

25|$|The Steele sisters come to London {{as guests}} of Mrs Jennings {{and after a}} brief {{acquaintance}} {{they are asked to}} stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, rather <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, so that he can marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E

Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French Minister of Internal Affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France.

25|$|Like most of Europe, Spain had {{suffered}} from famine and plague during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1500, Europe {{was beginning to}} emerge from these demographic disasters, and populations began to explode. Seville, which was home to 60,000 people in 1500 burgeoned to 150,000 {{by the end of}} the century. There was a substantial movement to the cities of Spain to capitalize on new opportunities as shipbuilders and merchants to service Spain's impressive and growing empire. The 16th century was a time of development in Spain as both agriculture and trade burgeoned. Throughout the harsh interior of Castile grain and wool production grew. The former fed an expansion of the population. The latter fed both local textile manufacturing and a lucrative trade with the Netherlands. The Castilian cities of Burgos, Segovia, Cuenca and Toledo, flourished with the expansion of the textile and metellurgical industries. Santander, on the northern Atlantic coast, grew in wealth from its traditional roles as a port linking the country's interior with Northern Europe and as a ship building centre. Southern cities like Cadiz and Seville expanded rapidly from the commerce and shipbuilding spurred on by the demands of the American colonies. Barcelona, already one of Europe's most important and sophisticated trading port cities in the Middle Ages, continued to develop. By 1590, Spain's population was far greater <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> had been in any previous period. It was during this last decade when Castile began to suffer crop failures and was struck by a plague from 1596 that brought about the first serious reversal in population numbers; a cycle that would repeat itself a number of times in different parts of the country through the 17th century.|$|E

Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album sounds good, but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice.

500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder, or {{the dream of a}} meeting place between Heaven and Earth (Genesis 28:12). Its little-known {{alternate}} title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Screenwriter and co-producer Bruce Joel Rubin perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State, the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Rubin said: [...] "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a meditative life you start to see that the world is really far different <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives." [...] Before writing his scripts for Jacob's Ladder and Ghost, which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal; previously, he has also written afterlife-themed Brainstorm and Deadly Friend. His original screenplay for Jacob's Ladder differs significantly at parts from the final film, especially towards the ending.|$|E
500|$|The ancestral {{condition}} of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw, based on Eocene primate fossils, suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb. Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb. [...] Collectively, early strepsirrhine primates are known as adapiforms. Adapiforms {{are considered to be}} a paraphyletic group (containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms. In terms of ecology, the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a folivorous (leaf-eating) diet among the ancestral adapiform population, since that would select for reduced incisors, which would serve as an exaptation (a trait with adaptive value for something other <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was originally selected for), which could then be used for personal or social grooming. However, the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions, since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss.|$|E
