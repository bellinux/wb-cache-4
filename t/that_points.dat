5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (<b>that</b> <b>points</b> to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{is sent to}} {{the ruined}} planet Harvest to {{investigate}} Covenant activity, where Cutter learns that the Covenant has excavated something at the planet's northern pole. When the UNSC's main outpost on Harvest is captured, Cutter orders Forge to retake it. Soon after, Forge scouts the Covenant excavation and discovers that they, {{under the direction of the}} Arbiter, have discovered a Forerunner facility. Forge's troops defeat the Covenant forces before they can destroy the installation, and Anders arrives. She determines that the facility is an interstellar map, and recognizes a set of coordinates <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to the human colony of Arcadia.|$|E
5|$|They trace Hoffman to his home, {{finding his}} {{equipment}} {{used to create}} the chemical agent downstairs but no sign of Hoffman. Walter nearly suffocates from an agent left by Hoffman, but Olivia and Peter are able to save him in time. As the FBI search the premises, they find evidence <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to a convention being held to promote world equality. Olivia and Peter depart {{to try to find}} Hoffman, while Walter remains behind, examining Hoffman's equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{intersection}} of these surfaces define coordinate lines. At any selected point, tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> define {{a set of}} basis vectors {e1, e2, …, en} at <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> <b>That</b> is: ...|$|R
25|$|The law of {{superposition}} allows Coulomb's law to {{be extended}} to include any number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due {{to a system of}} point charges is simply the vector addition of the individual forces acting alone on <b>that</b> <b>point</b> charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force vector is parallel to the electric field vector at <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> with <b>that</b> <b>point</b> charge removed.|$|R
30|$|Directional queries find FOVs {{which the}} orientations overlap with the user-specified {{direction}} requests. The direction requests can be directional internal (e.g., the Northeast), inwards (e.g., FOVs <b>that</b> <b>pointing</b> toward the query point) and outwards (e.g., FOVs <b>that</b> <b>pointing</b> outward the query point).|$|R
5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD <b>that</b> <b>points</b> {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern <b>that</b> <b>points</b> in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{before the}} Duffield Road level {{crossing}} was the Derby Canal Wharf where the Little Eaton Gangway also terminated and at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> a goods yard was provided. The line was double to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> but {{from then on}} was largely single.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, Ernesto Giménez Caballero and Luis Buñuel {{founded the}} first cine-club (film society), in Madrid. By <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> Madrid was already the primary {{center of the}} industry; 44 of the 58 films {{released}} up until <b>that</b> <b>point</b> had been produced there.|$|R
2500|$|At 03:45 on {{the morning}} of April 30, the refugee {{evacuation}} was halted. Ambassador Martin had been ordering that South Vietnamese be flown out with Americans up to <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> [...] Kissinger and Ford quickly ordered Martin to evacuate only Americans from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> forward.|$|R
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. On {{each stage of}} the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended <b>that</b> <b>points</b> would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a team time trial. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis <b>that</b> <b>points</b> {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E

25|$|Young Earth creationists {{disagree}} with the methodological naturalism {{that is part of}} the scientific method. Instead, they assert the actions of God as described in the Bible occurred as written and therefore only scientific evidence <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to the Bible being correct can be accepted. See Creation-evolution controversy for a more complete discussion.|$|E

30|$|Determination of {{vertical}} illumination and vector/scalar ratio {{at a point}} requires the calculations of cubic illumination [8] at <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> Cubic illumination specifies the spatial distribution of illumination in terms of illuminances on six surfaces of a small cube centered at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> (Fig.  3 b).|$|R
25|$|However, {{not every}} problem is {{alleviated}} {{by the presence}} of EcM fungi. There is some evidence <b>that</b> <b>points</b> to an inhibition in degrading recalcitrant pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It is thought that these fungi take away nutrients from other degraders that would be better at degrading these compounds, therefore inhibiting their actions.|$|E
25|$|Like ferromagnetism, ferrimagnets {{retain their}} {{magnetization}} {{in the absence}} of a field. However, like antiferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electron spins tend to point in opposite directions. These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction, than from the sublattice <b>that</b> <b>points</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The Mona Lisa example pictured {{at right}} {{provides}} a simple illustration. Each {{point on the}} painting can be represented as a vector pointing {{from the center of}} the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice <b>that</b> <b>points</b> along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector <b>that</b> <b>points</b> directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} general terms, a saddle {{point for a}} smooth {{function}} (whose graph is a curve, surface or hypersurface) is a stationary <b>point</b> such <b>that</b> the curve/surface/etc. {{in the neighborhood of}} <b>that</b> <b>point</b> is not entirely on any side of the tangent space at <b>that</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In complex analysis, a {{removable}} singularity of a holomorphic function {{is a point}} at which the function is undefined, but it is possible to redefine the function at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> {{in such a way that}} the resulting function is [...] regular in a neighbourhood of <b>that</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lie sphere {{geometry}} is a geometrical {{theory of}} planar or spatial geometry {{in which the}} fundamental concept is the circle or sphere. It was introduced by Sophus Lie in the nineteenth century. The main idea which leads to Lie sphere geometry is that lines (or planes) {{should be regarded as}} circles (or spheres) of infinite radius and <b>that</b> <b>points</b> in the plane (or space) should be regarded as circles (or spheres) of zero radius.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of a Hausdorff space says <b>that</b> <b>points</b> can be separated by neighborhoods. It turns out that this implies something which is seemingly stronger: in a Hausdorff space every pair of disjoint compact sets can also be separated by neighborhoods, in other words there is a neighborhood of one set and a neighborhood of the other, such that the two neighborhoods are disjoint. This {{is an example of}} the general rule that compact sets often behave like points.|$|E
25|$|This {{is not a}} {{clash of}} civilisations or religions, and it reaches far beyond Islam and America, on which efforts are being made to focus the {{conflict}} {{in order to create}} the delusion of a visible confrontation and a solution based upon force. There is indeed a fundamental antagonism here, but one <b>that</b> <b>points</b> past the spectre of America (which is perhaps the epicentre, but in no sense the sole embodiment, of globalisation) and the spectre of Islam (which is not the embodiment of terrorism either) to triumphant globalisation battling against itself.|$|E
