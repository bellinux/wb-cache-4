[...] "This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led <b>to</b> <b>believe...</b> <b>I</b> relied on heresy , that was perhaps my mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 2006 World Cup, the Calciopoli trial {{verdicts}} relegated Juventus to Serie B. Since Juventus were ineligible {{to qualify}} for the Champions League, Cannavaro decided to leave. [...] "Even if I know this may be hard <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>I</b> would have stayed at Juventus had they remained in Serie A – even with a 30-point deduction." [...] He followed Juve manager Fabio Capello to Real Madrid in the summer of 2006. In his two-year Scudetto-winning stint with Juventus, Cannavaro made over 100 total appearances in all competitions. His transfer was met with disappointment from the Juventus fans, who had accepted him as one of their own.|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{stated that}} his early fantasies were about women, which [...] "led me <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> {{was on the}} path to heterosexuality", but at puberty he started to fantasise about men, which he later said [...] "had {{something}} to do with my environment". At the age of 19, Michael told Andrew Ridgeley and close friends that he was bisexual. Michael also told one of his two sisters, but he was advised by friends not to tell his parents about his sexuality. In a 1999 interview with The Advocate, Michael told the Editor in Chief, Judy Wieder, that it was [...] "falling in love with a man that ended his conflict over bisexuality".|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to Barberi {{was also}} present here where on his {{journeys}} to the Mass centre local youths would throw rocks at him, though two youths {{took to the}} decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each rock that hit him {{and place it in}} his pocket. During many of these frequent attacks Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man was about to turn off, Barberi retorted: [...] "Jesus Christ said over the consecrated elements, [...] "This is my body" [...] you say [...] "No. It is not his body!" [...] Who then am I <b>to</b> <b>believe?</b> <b>I</b> prefer to believe Jesus Christ." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, Time was {{met with}} {{controversy}} {{for the release of}} a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto and the legend Saving Mexico (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment {{for the first time in}} 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying [...] "the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary", that [...] "American leaders could learn a thing or two from their resurgent southern neighbor" [...] and saying Mexicans citizens' [...] "alarms were replaced with applause". The last part proved false, when the cover immediately spawned heavy amounts of backlash on social media, becoming a meme which spawned multiple parody covers ranging from changing the legend to mock words like [...] "Selling Mexico", [...] "Slaving Mexico", [...] "Starving Mexico", [...] "Who is saving Mexico from this ass-hole?" [...] to editing Peña Nieto into clown make-up, dressed as the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, the Pope, to one featuring an old lady holding a gun with the legend [...] "Saving Mexico... pero de Peña Nieto" [...] (but from Peña Nieto). Multiple articles criticized the article, and some websites even asked Time magazine if Peña Nieto paid for the cover story. This prompted Michael Crowley, the writer of the article, to post on Twitter: [...] "Remarkable how many critics of Mexico's president seem <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> must have literally taken a bribe to write a positive story about him".|$|E
