5|$|Originally, Mount Carmel {{was located}} in Edwards County. After a drought in 1820 killed a {{majority}} of the settlers, <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> was moved from Palmyra, Illinois to Albion.

During the bickering for <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> location, Hinde ran for county commissioner in 1821 against John Buckles, receiving only two votes against Buckles' 151. In 1822 Hinde ran for the office of Illinois House of Representatives and narrowly lost to Gilbert T. Pell.

5|$|Scott County {{was formed}} {{by an act of}} the Wisconsin Territorial {{legislature}} in 1837. Both Davenport and its neighbor Rockingham campaigned to become <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat.</b> The city with the most votes from Scott County citizens in the February 1838 election would become <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat.</b> On the eve of the election, Davenport citizens acquired the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so they could vote in the election. Davenport won the election {{with the help of the}} laborers. Rockingham supporters protested the elections to the territorial governor, on the grounds the laborers from Dubuque were not Scott County residents. The governor refused to certify the results of the election. A second election was held the following August. To avoid another import of voters, the governor set a 60-day residency requirement for all voters. Davenport won by two votes. Because the margin of victory was so close, a third election was held in the summer of 1840. As the August election drew nearer, Rockingham residents grew tired of <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> cause. Davenport easily won the third election. Consequently, to avoid questions about <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>seat,</b> Davenport quickly built the first county courthouse.|$|E
