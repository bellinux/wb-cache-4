40|$|We {{consider}} stochastic, time-varying transportation networks, {{where the}} arc weights (arc travel times) are random variables with probability distribution functions that vary with time. Efficient procedures {{are widely available}} for determining least <b>time</b> <b>paths</b> in deterministic networks. In stochastic but time-invariant networks, least expected <b>time</b> <b>paths</b> can be determined by setting each random arc weight to its expected value and solving an equivalent deterministic problem. This paper addresses the problem of determining least expected <b>time</b> <b>paths</b> in stochastic, time-varying networks. Two procedures are presented. The first procedure determines the a priori least expected <b>time</b> <b>paths</b> from all origins to a single destination for each departure time in the peak period. The second procedure determines lower bounds on the expected times of these a priori least expected <b>time</b> <b>paths.</b> This procedure determines an exact solution for the problem where the driver is permitted to react to revealed travel times on traveled links en route, i. e., in a time-adaptive route choice framework. Modifications {{to each of these}} procedures for determining least expected cost (where cost is not necessarily travel <b>time)</b> <b>paths</b> and lower bounds on the expected costs of these paths are given.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study time-bounded {{verification}} of a finite continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) C against a real-time specification, provided {{either as a}} metric temporal logic (MTL) property ϕ, or as a timed automaton (TA) A. The key question is: what is the probability of the set of <b>timed</b> <b>paths</b> of C that satisfy ϕ (or are accepted by A) over a time interval of fixed, bounded length? We provide approximation algorithms to solve these problems. We first derive a bound N such that <b>timed</b> <b>paths</b> of C with at most N discrete jumps are sufficient to approximate the desired probability up to ε. Then, for each discrete (untimed) path σ of length at most N, we generate timed constraints over variables de-termining the residence time of each state along σ, depending on the real-time specification under consideration. The probability of the set of <b>timed</b> <b>paths,</b> de-termined by the discrete path and the associated timed constraints, can thus be formulated as a multidimensional integral. Summing up all such probabilities yields the result. For MTL, we consider both the continuous and the pointwise semantics. The approximation algorithms differ mainly in constraints generation for {{the two types of}} specifications. ...|$|R

Under a technological assumption granting that the <b>time</b> <b>paths</b> of primary factor prices are monotonic, we show that, for each pair (lower cost/higher cost) of deposits, an intensity condition is necessary in order to have discontinuous extraction of the lower cost deposit.

The leaves are made with mosaic technique, the trunk instead is made with pieces of marble. The tree is a thick figure of symbolic meanings: it refers to life that transcends time and space. The tree has the truck {{on the surface of}} the earth, the roots in the ground and the branches in the sky. This symbolically takes up the salvation-historical <b>time</b> <b>path</b> from the Creation to the coming of Christ, with the intent of making the entrance-altar journey as a passage from darkness to light. Teruzzi was assisted by Luigi Beretta in the collection of biblical references. Along the tree-trunk are represented the stages of the history of salvation. Each stage or day of history is marked by a stone. At the base appears a continuous line, without interruption, in dark colors and dotted with tiny bright flashes (few golden mosaic tiles). It represents the primordial chaos which preceded the Creation, when the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the abyss (in black tiles), but already the spirit (in clear tiles) hovered over the waters (Gen[...] 1:29). The creation is marked by stones 7, numbered from 1 to 7 with simple marble tiles, and they are one for each day. On each of them it is represent the work of God in that day as written in Genesis. After the Creation are remembered the 10 generations Cycle from Adam to Noah and 10 generations from Noah to Abraham. Each group is made with different shades of color of the marble tiles, on which there are marked at the most salient character names from which generations are named. So we read the names of Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and then David, Solomon and finally Mary and Joseph. The generations from Adam to Jesus are linked along the axis of the shaft by a continuous sinusoidal curve, similar to a spiral. The mosaic is in reddish hues. From Jacob the branches beginning to widen: 12 branches to mark his 12 children, that, after Jacob, all become owners, heirs of the promise of a land, as descents of a Messiah.|$|E
