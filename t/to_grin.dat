25|$|Edrich {{should have}} gather in another hundred in the {{following}} Test at Melbourne. He was 89, and batting with audacious unconcern, when Scott gave him out leg before to a ball from Lindwall which even some Australian fieldsmen believed {{had come from the}} bat. It was one of the hotly discussed decisions of the tour, and while Edrich was distressed and disappointed he was still able <b>to</b> <b>grin</b> as he walked from the field.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} unrest {{around this}} question disturbed De Witt no end. His initial relations with Louis {{had been very}} amicable. In 1662 he renewed the old alliance with France, as we have seen, and this alliance was helpful in the conflict with England and Munster, when the French sent auxiliary troops to help shore up the Dutch eastern defenses in 1665. Except for the Caribbean, France did not {{take part in the}} war with England. As a matter of fact the new French West India Company, formed in 1664, took Cayenne by force away from the WIC in 1665, but the Dutch were forced <b>to</b> <b>grin</b> and bear this, because of the ongoing war with England at the time. But the way Louis was acting in the matter of the Spanish Netherlands made De Witt anxious that the old partition treaty should not become operational. It offered a number of equally unpalatable prospects for the Dutch: unwanted incorporation of Antwerp (the blockade of which was now enshrined in the peace treaty of 1648 with Spain) would open up that city's trade; and a resurgent France as an immediate neighbor would necessitate the building up of the standing army, an expense the regents wanted to avoid at all costs.|$|E

5000|$|Jungle, desert, {{mountain}} and savannah swam into one disagreeable continuity…all the peoples and sub-divisions of the peoples, all the cultures and languages and religions, were {{forced by the}} European imagination into one mould. Out of it stepped the “native,” the “savage,” offering the blood of sacrifice <b>to</b> <b>grinning</b> gods, dancing in lunatic abandon around flames and…making a meal of his enemies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord love me, Dick, {{but he was}} joyed to see me,--him {{with the}} upper hand and wedding Tilly. Chance to puff big over me. The tale that I was hot after her had spread through the camps, and my {{presence}} did him proud. All hands knew me, without my blanket, and set <b>to</b> <b>grinning</b> and giggling.
