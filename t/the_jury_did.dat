5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E

White mobs committed murders, accompanied by wholesale destruction of black houses, churches and schools, in the small communities of Ocoee, November 1920; Perry in December 1922; and Rosewood in January 1923. The governor appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate Rosewood and Levy County, but <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not find sufficient evidence to prosecute.

25|$|At {{the time}} of decision, the Supreme Court of Georgia had {{reviewed}} 63 rape cases. Only six of these involved a death sentence. The Georgia court had set aside one, leaving five death sentences for rape intact from among all the rape convictions obtained since Furman. From the statistical evidence, the Court concluded that in at least 90% of rape cases, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not impose a death sentence. The objective evidence, state death penalty laws, and behavior of juries, suggested {{that the death penalty}} for rape was rare.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the death}} penalty was imposed, both the {{conviction}} and sentence were automatically appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. Davis and his lawyers requested a new trial, citing problems with the trial site and selection of the jury. The request was denied in March 1992. In March 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court also upheld Davis's conviction and sentence, ruling that the judge had correctly refused to change trial site and that the racial composition of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not deny his rights. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in November 1993. Direct appeals having been exhausted, in March 1994 an order was signed for Davis's execution.|$|E
25|$|Clark was {{immediately}} arrested and the guns were found hidden at his work-place. Bundy {{was charged with}} two murders: Murray and the unknown victim whose killing she confessed to having been present at. Clark was charged with six murders. At his trial, he acted as his own defense counsel and tried to blame Bundy for everything, portraying himself as an innocent dupe. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not believe {{him and he was}} sentenced to death in 1983. He remains on California's death row. Bundy, on the other hand, made a plea bargain and in return for her testimony received only a 52 years to life sentence.

5000|$|One {{point of}} {{historical}} departure {{in the play}} is that the script gives <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> only a single opportunity to vote.

[...] In contexts requiring greater historical authenticity, this second vote can easily be reintroduced although, {{depending on the size}} of <b>the</b> <b>jury,</b> <b>doing</b> so may add to the act’s running time.|$|R
5000|$|An {{abnormality}} of {{mind has}} been defined by Lord Parker CJ [...] "as state of mind so {{different from that of}} ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal".

25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the consent form issued to parents {{did not say that}} winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} theory of “representative deliberation” to {{describe}} the democratic ideal that jurors seek to practice. Given its long history, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> not fit neatly into {{any one of the}} most familiar types of democracy, such as direct democracy, representative democracy, or deliberative democracy. However, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>does</b> hold together elements of all of these theories. In line with direct democracy, we select jurors from the people-at-large. In line with representative democracy, we seek to draw jurors from a representative cross-section of the community. In line with deliberative democracy, jurors talk as well as vote and seek to change one another’s minds. The resulting hybrid is what this article calls “representative deliberation. ” The core idea is that deliberation works best on diverse panels where jurors from different backgrounds bring different views and life experiences to bear on the impartial consideration of the evidence. The article reviews empirical studies supporting the theory of representative deliberation and proposes changes in jury selection to remove obstacles to empaneling representative juries...|$|R

2500|$|Sampson {{was charged}} {{in a federal}} court in Boston, found guilty and, on December 23, 2003, sentenced to death. The jury deliberated for ten hours after hearing six weeks of evidence. Sampson had pleaded guilty, so <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not need to decide whether he killed McCloskey and Rizzo, but the jury heard the murders {{described}} in graphic detail during the sentencing phase of the trial. Prosecutors portrayed Sampson as a ruthless, calculating killer who preyed on good samaritans. [...] The last time the Commonwealth used the penalty was in 1974. It {{was the first time}} anyone in Massachusetts has been sentenced to die under the federal death penalty law.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{unanimous}} in its result, the Supreme Court split six to three in its legal {{analysis of the}} case. The issue was whether the trial judge made a legal error in his instructions to the jury, and in particular in his [...] "re-instruction" [...] responding to the jury's question about Pickton's liability {{if he was not}} the only person involved. Writing for the majority, Madam Justice Charron found that [...] "the trial judge's response to the question posed by <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not adversely impact on the fairness of the trial". She further found that the trial judge's overall instructions with respect to other suspects [...] "compendiously captured the alternative routes to liability that were realistically in issue in this trial. The jury was also correctly instructed that it could convict Mr. Pickton if the Crown proved this level of participation coupled with the requisite intent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The killing being indisputable, Carnegie {{would have}} been {{condemned}} if the jury had merely given a verdict {{on the point of}} fact. In these circumstances, his counsel, Robert Dundas of Arniston, told the jury that they were entitled to judge on [...] "the point of law" [...] as well as the [...] "point of fact". He asserted that they should only decide whether in their conscience Carnegie had committed murder, or whether his guilt was not diminished or annihilated by the circumstances of the case. Quite unexpectedly <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not give a verdict of either [...] "proven" [...] or [...] "not proven" [...] but instead gave a verdict of [...] "not guilty", thus establishing a great constitutional principle of a Scottish Jury's right to jury nullification and endowing Scots with the verdicts: [...] "proven", [...] "not proven" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] which remain contentious to this day.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the defense}} and the {{prosecution}} were allowed to submit proposed jury instructions to Judge Hall, which he could choose to either accept or reject. Celia's defense team submitted several instructions to Judge Hall requesting that the jury acquit Celia if they believed {{that she had been}} justifiably resisting sexual assault when she had killed Robert Newsom. In the state of Missouri, at the time of Celia's trial, it was a crime [...] "to take any woman unlawfully against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be defiled," [...] and resistance of such an offense would have been considered a justifiable excuse for a woman to kill a man. The defense requested that the jury be instructed that the words [...] "any woman" [...] included enslaved women, and that Celia should not be convicted if they believed that she had been attempting to resist rape when she had killed Newsom. Judge Hall did not accept these proposed instructions, and they were not delivered to the jury. The instructions that were actually given to <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not address the motive for Celia's crime at all, or allow for an acquittal {{based on the idea that}} she would have been justified in using physical force to resist sexual assault at the hands of her master.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton {{gave his}} first {{interview}} {{about the case}} on The View. Ashton said of the verdict, [...] "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But {{from the perspective of}} what we do, this was a fantastic case." [...] He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, [...] "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." [...] Ashton additionally explained that if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>did</b> not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, [...] "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. [...] "You can't believe in {{the rule of law and}} not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case [...] "struck such a nerve" [...] with the public. [...] "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from , it just outrages them." [...] Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having [...] "the potential to be a great attorney".|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> Grand <b>Jury</b> Clause <b>does</b> very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of <b>the</b> grand <b>jury.</b> For example, <b>the</b> Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence.
