5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. <b>The</b> <b>Latch</b> porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly twenty years, before being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E

25|$|The mandibles of O. bauri {{are kept}} in place with a latch called the clypeus. Once <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> is {{released}}, all of the energy stored is quickly released and the mandibles close, very similar to a crossbow when fired.|$|E
25|$|Tri-Ad Lock – A locking {{mechanism}} exclusively licensed to Cold Steel. It {{is a form}} of lockback which incorporates a thick steel stop pin between the front of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> and the back of the tang to transfer force from the blade into the handle.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent this, the DC-10 used a [...] "fail safe" [...] {{latching}} system {{held in place}} by [...] "over top dead center latches", five C-shaped latches mounted on a common torque shaft that are rotated over fixed latching pins ("spools") fixed to the fuselage. Because of their shape, when <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> are in <b>the</b> proper position, pressure on the door does not place torque on <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> that could cause them to open, and actually further seats them on the pins. Normally <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> are opened and closed by a screw jack powered by an electric actuator motor.|$|R
50|$|Examination of the {{aircraft}} and the cargo door, which was recovered largely intact in Windsor, demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> had never rotated to their locked position. In their locked position, pressure on the door presses <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> further shut, and no force is transmitted into the actuator system that closes and opens them. With <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> only partially closed, forces on the door were transmitted back into the actuator, eventually overwhelming it at about 6,600 lbf. The rapid depressurization when the door broke off caused the floor above it to partially cave in, which pulled the rudder cable to its extension limit and severed several other operating cables.|$|R
50|$|The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 21 but as Volynov {{tried to}} undock from the station, <b>the</b> docking <b>latches</b> failed to release properly. As he fired the jets {{to move the}} {{spacecraft}} away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved {{out of range of}} ground communications, the cosmonauts received only the first set of emergency procedures. Volynov tried a second time to undock but only managed slightly to loosen <b>the</b> <b>latches.</b> <b>The</b> situation persisted for an entire orbit, 90 minutes, when the final set of emergency procedures were received and the crew finally disengaged <b>the</b> <b>latches.</b>|$|R
25|$|A garden door {{resembles a}} French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the {{operating}} door is next to the adjacent fixed door and <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> {{is located at the}} wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an espagnolette bolt.|$|E
25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the slide cover latch brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> brackets installed on later models.|$|E
25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{latching}} {{microelectromechanical system}} (MEMS) switch is reported, {{which uses a}} compact configuration of thermal actuators. In <b>the</b> proposed <b>latching</b> mechanism, <b>the</b> necessary displacement {{of one of the}} contacts can be reduced, allowing the use of a linear thermal actuator. This linear actuator together with a V-shaped actuator can be aligned next to each other, requiring less area than <b>the</b> classical <b>latching</b> switch design. Another advantage of the proposed design is the high contact force of 1. 33 mN, ensuring a stable contact resistance. <b>The</b> <b>latching</b> switch was fabricated in the Metal multi-user MEMS processes (MUMPs) technology and its functionality was successfully tested. In <b>the</b> <b>latched</b> state, a switch resistance of 0. 6 Ω was measured...|$|R

25|$|Very rarely, nipple {{pain can}} be caused by {{vasospasm}} of the nipple. In essence, blood does not flow properly to the nipple which causes the nipple to blanch. This {{can be caused}} by trauma to the nipple through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the nipple. The pain is intense during <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the nipple is blanched. The nipple can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the nipple.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{developments}} {{after it}} issued its original report, NTSB issued a superseding accident report on March 18, 1992. In its superseding report, the NTSB {{determined that the}} probable cause of the accident was the sudden opening of the cargo door, which was attributed to improper wiring and deficiencies in the door's design. It appeared {{in this case that}} a short circuit caused an uncommanded rotation of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> cams, which forced the weak locking sectors to distort and allow the rotation, thus enabling the pressure differential and aerodynamic forces to blow the door off the fuselage, ripping away the hinge fixing structure, the cabin floor and side fuselage skin, causing the explosive decompression.|$|E
25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{conventional}} thyristor, {{once it has}} been switched on by the gate terminal, <b>the</b> device remains <b>latched</b> in <b>the</b> on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current {{to remain in the}} on state), providing the anode current has exceeded <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> current (IL). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the holding current (IH). In normal working condition <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure IL [...] has to come above the IH on y-axis since IL>IH.|$|R
40|$|We have designed, {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} an XY-addressable readout {{system that is}} specifically tailored for the reading of superconducting flux qubits in an integrated circuit that could enable adiabatic quantum optimization. In such a system, the flux qubits only need to be read {{at the end of}} an adiabatic evolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus simplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for an N-qubit adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises N hysteretic dc SQUIDs and N rf SQUID latches controlled by 2 √(N) + 2 bias lines. <b>The</b> <b>latching</b> elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc SQUIDs are then coupled to <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages: First, <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that significantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits to the dc SQUIDs using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by the switching of the hysteretic dc SQUIDs, thus allowing one to interrogate <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic switching of the dc SQUIDs. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve single qubit read error rates of < 10 ^- 6 with this readout scheme. We have characterized the system-level performance of a 128 -qubit readout system and have measured a readout error probability of 8 × 10 ^- 5 in the presence of optimal latching element bias conditions.

25|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, the STS-135 lead flight {{director}} Mr. Kwatsi Alibaruho said that transfers were right on timeline with 70% complete. The crew {{was ahead of}} timeline on earlier days but the computer problem caused them to slow down. He further mentioned that <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> on Atlantis's middeck locker for LiOH canisters is broken, and as a result, the entire panel had been fastened to floor with fasteners. The LiOH canisters are used to scrub Carbon Dioxide from the cabin air inside the shuttle. When Atlantis is docked to the Space station, the station Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) takes care of both the station's and Atlantis's air revitalization. However, when Atlantis flies solo after undocking, LiOH canisters are required. Regarding the GPC-4 issue, Mr. Alibaruho {{said that it was}} a very infrequent failure, happened before only on STS-9 and the last time a problem occurred on GPC 4 was on Atlantis's STS-71 mission.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke <b>the</b> <b>latch,</b> rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E

2500|$|All RCDs have a {{latching}} feature. [...] <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> becomes set {{when the}} device is armed - typically by moving a switch to the on position, or depressing a reset button.

[...] That trigger is normally intended to be the detection of a serious electrical irregularity, but un-latching can also occur by the disconnection of the power; such power-disconnection is not regarded as an irregular event, and includes such events as a user disconnecting the power intentionally or unintentionally, or a temporary power failure attributed to the electricity service provider.|$|E
