5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> had butter in a week.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} stage, the film underwent several name changes. Initially, the media {{reported that the}} film was titled Janam Janam Ka Saath Hamara Tumhara, shortened to Janam Janam Ka Saath, but later it became Teri Meri Kahaani. In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated only <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet decided {{the title of the}} film. Such speculation was believed to be a marketing choice to increase curiosity for the film.|$|E

He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book A Cruising Voyage Round the World, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, Meyszner's {{campaign}} against the German-Chetnik agreements escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> upheld their previous agreements and that the Croats, as well as Muslims in Albania, Kosovo and the Sandžak, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks. The commander of the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps, General Asen Nikoloff, also opposed the agreements. Meyszner's increasing objections to the agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from {{the west and the}} advance of the Red Army from the east.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E

5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused {{the participants who were}} opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Harlow {{and grew up in}} Irthlingborough. He was home-schooled from age 13 after being bullied at school, and his parents split up when he was 14. He lived with his father Tony, a former {{professional}} golfer, and did not see his mother again until he was 19. During the 2007 World Championship, it was reported that he had developed a rift with his father, {{who was a member of}} the World Snooker board. He said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> spoken in over a year, but that he would willingly speak to his father again if the other called him.|$|E
5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her about being in the finale, and that she was glad <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E

5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} {{dominated the}} government, there remained a significant following for James, {{particularly in the}} Highlands. His cause, which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James, led {{to a series of}} risings. An initial Jacobite military attempt was led by John Graham, now Viscount Dundee. His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated William's forces at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld. The complete defeat of James in Ireland by William at the Battle of Aughrim (1691), ended {{the first phase of the}} Jacobite military effort. In the aftermath of the Jacobite defeat on 13 February 1692 in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1951-1952 season, the TSO {{refused to}} renew the {{contracts}} of these musicians, stating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not from the Canadian Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not speak about the matter in public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by their colleagues and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> solved that problem yet.|$|E
