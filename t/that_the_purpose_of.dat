5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the systems are to replicate, {{regardless of whether they}} benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|France was in {{constitutional}} crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris. Although {{moved by the}} death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> his visit was to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets. On 31July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the events {{should be to}} present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached {{at the turn of}} the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E

5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, {{which at the time}} were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he {{had fallen in love with}} her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, {{there has been}} no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
