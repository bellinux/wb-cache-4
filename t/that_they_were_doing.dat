25|$|At 5:20p.m. on April 18, the FBI {{released}} {{images of}} two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them. The FBI said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> this {{in part to}} limit harm to persons wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, Barker told People {{that they}} were back together, that they had {{pulled out of the}} separation, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> what was best for {{themselves}} and their children—making them happy. The couple showed up at a party, holding hands, kissing and wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
25|$|Both the Gaskells {{taught at}} the two Mosley Street Sunday Schools, which {{instructed}} young mill workers. Lessons covered basic numeracy and literacy in addition to traditional Biblical teaching, and Gaskell defended the practice of giving non-religious instruction on a Sunday, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> 'their Father's business' by teaching reading. He and others lobbied successfully in 1832 for the two schools to be moved to improved premises, and some 400 pupils had been enrolled by 1847.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the second}} film the cast said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>done</b> with The Inbetweeners and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> making any new film or any more episodes as [...] "they are all grown-up." ...|$|R
50|$|Their {{father was}} killed in the {{shooting}} and both Lori and Sue look to Anne for guidance. Anne <b>is</b> quite aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> this purely because no one else would understand.|$|R
25|$|Fitzsimmons {{and others}} even denied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> work on Hoffa's orders. National {{trucking}} industry talks, interrupted when Hoffa went to jail, resumed with Fitzsimmons at the table. Although the pact expired {{and the union}} struck for three days, Fitzsimmons was able to negotiate a new agreement (with a federal mediator's help) which some believed was richer than any Hoffa could have obtained. He negotiated a second contract three years later which provided a 27 percent wage increase over three years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} European release of Devil Survivor Overclocked, some bugs were prevalent; among these were various game crashes such as after the player summoned a demon during a battle and another crash {{occurring}} during the devil auction. Ghostlight, the publisher, made an announcement regarding this on March 31, 2013, and said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> {{everything they could}} to fix the problems as soon as possible. On April 24, 2013, Ghostlight announced that a bug-fix patch had passed testing, and was to be submitted to Nintendo for distribution. It was released on May 28, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
5000|$|Money Is Not the Measurement - their {{determination}} is not {{driven by}} the money, payment <b>is</b> a sign <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> their job well; however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mainly motivated by influence with freedom.|$|R
5|$|After more clips, Snake {{returns for}} a final time, with ammunition, and aims his gun at them, but the family reveals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> singing. Snake {{declares}} {{that he has no}} problems with them and leaves.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is about}} a couple that stays {{together}} even though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not happy. <b>They</b> still pretend <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> fine together for others to see, but everyone knows that it isn't working out between them.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} August 1913, Captain Bucey {{was taking}} the BC Express up from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache when he was stopped a cable strung across the river at Mile 141 where the railway was {{building}} a bridge. Although the railway had promised {{that they would not}} impede steamer travel on the river, it was apparent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> just that. Bucey turned the BC Express back towards Fort George and immediately wired the company's head office at Ashcroft and informed them of the obstruction. The BC Express Company had the Board of Railway Commissioners investigate the situation and the Board came back in the company's favor and told the railway they must build the bridge at Mile 141 and the other at Bear River with lift spans as they had promised. The GTP refused the order, stating that if they changed the level of the bridges they'd have to change the level of the grade. The company took the railway to court for damages and loss of revenue, as they had been earning in excess of $5000 a week on that route, {{but by the time the}} case was heard, World War I had begun and the company's attorney was engaged in war work and was unable to appear. His replacement, a junior partner with little experience, was unable to prepare and present the evidence properly and the company lost the case.|$|E
500|$|When Andros {{took over}} the {{administration}} of New York in August 1688, {{he met with the}} Iroquois at Albany to renew to covenant. In this meeting he annoyed the Iroquois by referring to them as [...] "children" [...] (implying subservience to the English), rather than [...] "brethren" [...] (implying equality). He returned to Boston amid further attacks on the New England frontier by Abenaki parties, who admitted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> so in part because of French encouragement.|$|E
500|$|The {{action for}} which the Daughters of Mother Jones are best known is their {{organization}} of an ongoing strike at the Pittston Coal State Headquarters in Lebanon, Virginia. [...] The women would meet outside the headquarters and strike, without the instruction or organization of the UMWA. [...] They picketed outside every Monday and Wednesday {{in the hopes that}} they could gain more media attention and support for the miners. Despite this, the Daughters did not feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> enough, so they independently constructed a sit down strike to take place at Pittston Coal headquarters, unorganized by the union.|$|E
50|$|Carter {{thinks the}} Eagle {{is too low}} and is {{descending}} too rapidly but Kano counters <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> just fine by Computer. Irving reports <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> on course and holding and that everything is fine, but Carter observes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too close and too fast.|$|R
50|$|Codex is a {{knowledge}} base that records common practices for Ruby. Uses crowdsourced data from developers and searches all code, looking for patterns, that way {{if someone is}} coding in a strange way, Codex lets them know <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> something wrong.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of Kim Jong-il's death, the PSIA {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> intelligence work on North Korea by conducting intelligence work towards Chongryon, as they had remitted money and gifts to North Korea before sanctions were handed to the communist nation.|$|R
500|$|The writers {{hoped to}} fool viewers into {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> a straightforward séance episode, {{and so there}} is little humour prior to the episode's first twist. For Steadman, the writing meant that both the audience and the character of Tina are fooled together. Nonetheless, humour remained elsewhere in the script; Lloyd looked forward to performing a particular joke involving blue paint. Terry refers to his colleagues variously as [...] "Pepe and His Friends", a reference to a variety act with a similar name, and a [...] "warm prop", a disparaging name which, according to the writers, has been used in the film industry to refer to extras.|$|E
500|$|Brent Spiner {{returned}} to the Star Trek franchise, having previously played the character of Data in [...] In Enterprise he {{played the role of}} Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You know, as a fan of the original series, if I heard <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found out <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more {{in awe of the}} fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{it be that}} Thayendanega's gang has deserted General St. Leger?" [...] I asked, in a whisper. [...] "The {{sergeant}} {{will have}} it <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>done</b> with the siege, in which case it wouldn't <b>be</b> surprisin' if <b>they</b> had sneaked away." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} some hints about the {{different}} attitudes that Willow and Tara have towards magic, with Tara fearing that the Scoobies were wrong to meddle with the laws of nature, while Willow seems sure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing.|$|R
60|$|It {{is to be}} hoped {{there are}} not many such thoroughgoing tyrants; but {{selfishness}} is always ready to make any one into a tyrant, and Mammon is a false god, who manages to make his servants satisfied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> their duty.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to questions of why God would allow the Zionists some measure of success if Zionism is against the Talmud; anti-Zionist religious Jews respond with the following; [...] "The fallacy of the argument lies in the undeniable {{fact that there is}} evil in this world. Hashem allows people free will to choose to do wrong, and even to be successful in doing wrong on a large scale.... Why Hashem decided to grant their efforts some degree of success is one of the mysteries of our era. But the fact that they succeeded is no more a proof <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing, than {{is the fact that the}} Germans succeeded in killing six million Jews a proof <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mario Sepúlveda (40), {{served as}} the {{energetic}} host of the miner's video journals that {{were sent to the}} surface to reassure the world <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> well. The local media dubbed him [...] "Super Mario" [...] after the Super Mario Bros. video game for his energy, wit and humor.|$|E
2500|$|An {{argument}} soon erupted between Clarke and Callan, because Callan did {{not have}} any amplifiers. Clarke had allowed him to share his during rehearsals, but Clarke then found he could not hear his solos because Callan was drowning him out. The argument ended with Clarke being sacked. Still short of amps, the band asked him to re-join a few days later. Clarke refused, feeling <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> Anchor Records an injustice because they had been paid an advance to record an album, but had done nothing productive towards making it. Blue Goose finally released their eponymous album through Anchor in 1974, crediting an instrumental track, entitled [...] "Over The Top", to Clarke-Hogarth-Perry.|$|E
50|$|The band {{is known}} to switch {{instruments}} when playing live with Stevenson on guitar, Price on bass, Egerton on Drums, with Alvarez singing. The band maintains that Chad Price is their current vocalist, but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> a few shows with former singer Reynolds.|$|R
50|$|The {{blind person}} sends these signals or types of non-verbal {{communication}} without being aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> so. These factors can all {{affect the way}} an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired. This leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely.|$|R
5000|$|Overtly, the {{two boys}} do not think of their acts as sexual, but as a wild [...] "horseplay" [...] {{which might have been}} inflicted also on another boy. However, Jack becomes aware of the {{softness}} of Jenny's breasts, and sees her looking at him—which makes him start feeling <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a mean thing". He resists the impulse to touch her breasts again and convinces Les to let her go.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has been}} doing {{research}} into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found {{what he called a}} [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but {{they did not want to}} lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 May 1862, Severnaya ptchela {{published}} an article by Leskov {{on the issue of}} the fires that started on 24 May, lasting for six days and destroying a large part of the Apraksin and Schukin quarters of the Russian capital, which popular rumour imputed to a group of [...] "revolutionary students and Poles" [...] that stood behind the [...] "Young Russia" [...] proclamation. Without supporting the rumour, the author demanded that the authorities should come up with a definitive statement which would either confirm or confute those allegations. The radical press construed this as being aimed at inciting the common people against the students and instigating police repressions. On the other hand, the authorities were unhappy too, for the article implied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> little to prevent the atrocities. The author's suggestion that [...] "firemen sent to the sites would do anything rather than idly stand by" [...] angered Alexander II himself, who reportedly said: [...] "This shouldn't have been allowed, this is a lie." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the boys}} {{did not turn}} back, and as they went {{steadily}} away they felt <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> their little part in the good work, and making their small sacrifices, like faithful members.|$|E
