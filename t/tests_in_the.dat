The Air Force offered a commission as a brigadier general, and Convair offered a job working on the SM-65 Atlas missile, but Hayward elected {{to stay in the}} navy.

5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moroccan desert.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of natural circadian rhythms on retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF; Anderson et al. in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 20 : 1063 - 1087, 1994). Individuals tested at optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening) showed a significantly greater RIF effect than individuals tested at non-optimal times (i. e., morning persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening and evening persons <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning). Thus, the limited quantity of resources available to allocate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inhibitory activity during non-optimal times produced a significant decrement in RIF. These findings are compatible with the inhibitory account of RIF and {{with the notion of}} a resource-demanding process underlying this memory phenomenon. © 2013 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{evidence}} suggests that the attention-based ability to regulate distraction varies across <b>the</b> day <b>in</b> synchrony with a circadian arousal rhythm that changes across the life span. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed whether neural activity in an attention control network also varies across the day and with behavioral markers. We <b>tested</b> older adults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning or afternoon and younger adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon using a 1 -back task with superimposed distractors, followed by an implicit test for the distractors. Behavioral results replicated earlier findings with older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning better able to ignore distraction than those <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. Imaging results showed that time of testing modulates task-related fMRI signals in older adults and that age differences were reduced when older adults are tested at peak times of day. In particular, older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning activated similar cognitive control regions to those activated by young adults (rostral prefrontal and superior parietal cortex), whereas older adults <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon were reliably different; furthermore, the degree to which participants were able to activate the control regions listed above correlated with the ability to suppress distracting information...|$|R
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage.

She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
