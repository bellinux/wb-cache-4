50|$|Trochodendron is a genus of {{flowering}} plants with one living species, Trochodendron aralioides, and six extinct species {{known from the}} fossil record. It was often considered the sole genus in the family <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> though botanists now also include the distinct genus Tetracentron in the family <b>Trochodendraceae.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... about 30 endemic families, including: Ginkgoaceae, Sciadopityaceae, <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Circaeasteraceae, Eucommiaceae, Eupteleaceae, Sargentodoxaceae, Nandinaceae, Pteridophyllaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Stachyuraceae, Sladeniaceae, Dipentodontaceae, Helwingiaceae.|$|E
50|$|Cercidiphyllaceae {{had for a}} {{long time}} been {{associated}} with Hamamelidaceae and <b>Trochodendraceae</b> and was often thought to be closer to the latter. Cercidiphyllaceae is now known {{to be a member of}} the woody clade of Saxifragales, along with Hamamelidaceae, Altingiaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae, but <b>Trochodendraceae</b> is in the basal eudicot order Trochodendrales. Altingiaceae was usually not separated from Hamamelidaceae until phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion might make Hamamelidaceae paraphyletic. The recognition of Altingiaceae as a separate family received strong statistical support in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Tetracentron is a genus of {{flowering}} plant, the sole living species being Tetracentron sinense. It was formerly considered the sole genus {{in the family}} Tetracentraceae, though modern botanists include it in the family <b>Trochodendraceae</b> together with the genus Trochodendron.|$|E
50|$|According to Takhtajan (1978), the {{following}} families are endemic to this kingdom: Ginkgoaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Glaucidiaceae, Hydrastidaceae (Hydrastis), <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Euptelaceae (Euptelea), Platanaceae, Eucommiaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Leitneriaceae, Paeoniaceae, Crossosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, Fouquieriaceae, Diapensiaceae, Simmondsiaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Penthoraceae, Bretschneideraceae, Limnanthaceae, Davidiaceae (Davidia), Toricelliaceae, Helwingiaceae, Theligonaceae, Dipentodontaceae, Cynomoriaceae, Adoxaceae, Trapellaceae (Trapella), Butomaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Aphyllanthaceae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trochodendraceae</b> is {{the only}} family of {{flowering}} plants in the order Trochodendrales. It comprises two extant genera, each with a single species found in south east Asia. The two living species (Tetracentron sinense and Trochodendron aralioides) both have secondary xylem without vessel elements, which is quite rare in angiosperms. As the vessel-free wood suggests primitiveness, these two species have attracted much taxonomic attention.|$|E
5000|$|Trochodendron aralioides, {{sometimes}} colloquially called [...] "wheel tree", is a {{flowering plant}} and the sole living {{species in the}} genus Trochodendron, which also includes several extinct species. It was also often considered the sole species in the family <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> though botanists now include the distinct genus Tetracentron in the same family. T.aralioides is native to Japan, southern Korea and Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|Trochodendron drachukii is an {{extinct species}} of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family <b>Trochodendraceae</b> known from a fossil fruiting structure found in the early Ypresian age Eocene fossils found in British Columbia, Canada. T. drachukii {{is one of the}} oldest members of the genus Trochodendron, which includes the living species T. aralioides, native to Japan, southern Korea and Taiwan and the coeval extinct species T. nastae from Washington state, United States.|$|E
50|$|The genus was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} family <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> but the family Eupteleaceae has been recognized by many taxonomists. The APG IV system (2016; unchanged from the APG III system of 2009, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998), recognizes it and places it in the order Ranunculales, in the clade eudicots. The family consists of a single genus Euptelea, with two species, native to eastern Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Trochodendron nastae is an {{extinct species}} of {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family <b>Trochodendraceae</b> known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene Ypresian stage Klondike Mountain Formation deposits of Northern Washington State. [...] T. nastae {{is one of the}} oldest members of the genus Trochodendron, which includes the living species T. aralioides, native to Japan, southern Korea and Taiwan and the coeval extinct species T. drachukii from the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of vessels in xylem {{has been considered}} {{to be one of}} the key innovations that led to the success of the flowering plants. It was once thought that vessel elements were an evolutionary innovation of flowering plants, but their absence from some basal angiosperms and their presence in some members of the Gnetales suggest that this hypothesis must be re-examined; vessel elements in Gnetales may not be homologous with those of angiosperms, or vessel elements that originated in a precursor to the angiosperms may have been subsequently lost in some basal lineages (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> and Winteraceae), described by Arthur Cronquist as [...] "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of Gnetum to be convergent with those of angiosperms.|$|E
50|$|Flora {{from both}} the sub-tropical and warm {{temperate}} climates inhabit areas of Taibai. Due to the mountain's rapid rises in elevation, plants from the middle temperate climate and alpine climates are {{also found in the}} same areas. Within the Nature Preserve's borders more than 1,700 different types of seed-bearing plants are found, comprising approximately 60% of the flora in the Qinling Range. Among the flora are found many second- and third-tier protected Chinese species, such as Chuan-Guo Vine, Eucommia, Kingdonia, Dipteronia sinensis, Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Euptelea pleiosperma, Acer miaotaiense, <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> Sinowilsonia, Taibai Rainbow (Larix chinensis), Qinling Crow's Head (Aconitum liouii), Chinese Hemlock, Populus purdomii, Circaeasteraceae, and Purple-Speckled Peony (Paeonia rockii), and others. About 40 types of animals inhabit the area, as well as 230 species of birds and several species of amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|In most plants, pitted tracheids {{function}} as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered {{to be one of}} the key innovations that led to the success of the angiosperms. However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or [...] "basal" [...] lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, <b>Trochodendraceae,</b> and Winteraceae), and their secondary xylem is described by Arthur Cronquist as [...] "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of Gnetum to be convergent with those of angiosperms. Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a primitive condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.|$|E
30|$|Tetracentron sinense Oliv. is a {{deciduous}} {{tree with}} a catkin-like inflorescence, {{and placed in}} its own family, Tetracentraceae previously (Fu & Bartholomew 2001), or more commonly in <b>Trochodendraceae</b> together with the monotypic Trochodendron (Martyn & Peter 2007). This species is today mainly distributed in south-central China (Fu & Bartholomew 2001), and scattered within a region 1100 – 3 500  m above sea level (Martyn & Peter 2007). Due to its rarity and poor ability to regenerate naturally, it is considered 'rare’ according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Fu 1992). Since its vesselless wood is quite rare in angiosperm suggesting primitiveness, the species has received much taxonomic attention (Chen et al. 2007, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009). However, studies on the reproductive biology of T. sinense are relatively scarce (Gan et al. 2012). Until recently, {{little is known about}} the breeding system and pollination ecology of T. sinense, the most well known plants due to its economic importance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{evolution}} of type II MADS box genes {{has been extensively}} studied in angiosperms. One of the best-understood subfamilies {{is that of the}} Arabidopsis gene APETALA 3 (AP 3). Previous work has demonstrated that the ancestral paleo AP 3 lineage was duplicated at some point within the basal eudicots to give rise to the paralogous TM 6 and eu AP 3 lineages. This event was followed in eu AP 3 orthologs by the replacement of the C-terminal paleoAP 3 motif with the derived euAP 3 motif. It has been suggested that the new motif was created by an eight-nucleotide insertion that produced a translational frameshift. Results The addition of 25 eudicot AP 3 homologs to the existing dataset has allowed us to clarify the process by which the euAP 3 motif evolved. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the eu AP 3 / TM 6 duplication maps very close {{to the base of the}} core eudicots, associated with the families <b>Trochodendraceae</b> and Buxaceae. We demonstrate that although the transformation of paleoAP 3 into euAP 3 was due to a frameshift mutation, this was the result of a single nucleotide deletion. The use of ancestral character state reconstructions has allowed us to demonstrate that the frameshift was accompanied by few other nucleotide changes. We further confirm that the sequence is evolving as coding region. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the simplest of genetic changes can result in the remodeling of protein sequence to produce a kind of molecular 'hopeful monster. ' Moreover, such a novel protein motif can become conserved almost immediately on the basis of what appears to be a rapidly generated new function. Given that the existing data on the function of such C-terminal motifs are somewhat disparate and contradictory, we have sought to synthesize previous findings within the context of the current analysis and thereby highlight specific hypotheses that require further investigation before the significance of the euAP 3 frameshift event can be fully understood. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fossil plant remains are {{preserved}} within the deposits of the Eocene Aspelintoppen Formation on Svalbard. These sediments form the youngest continental deposits of early Paleogene age. The Aspelintoppen Formation sediments represent crevasse splay, backswamp and ephemeral lake deposits that represent a broad lowland floodplain that {{was subject to}} frequent flooding. The forests grew at a palaeolatitude of 75 °N. New collections (1032 specimens) ofthe Aspelintoppen Formation flora are dominated by angiosperms including the Fagaceae? (Ushia olafsenii), Betulaceae (Corylites and Craspedodromophyllum), Hamamelidaceae (Platimelis pterospermoides), Platanaceae (Platimeliphyllum and Platanus), Ulmaceae (Ulmites ulmifolius), <b>Trochodendraceae</b> (Zizyphoides flabella), Cercidiphyllaceae (Trochodendroides), Juglandaceae (Juglans laurifolia) and Hippocastinaceae (Aesculus longipedunculus). In addition, conifer fossils include Metasequoia shoots and cones, as well as Thuja shoots. Fern fronds of Osmunda and Coniopteris are present, along with the horsetail Equisetum. The Aspelintoppen Formation vegetation grew locally on the floodplain with angiosperms dominating the riparian environment and a mixed angiosperm Metasequoia-dominated flora in the backswamp environment, with Equisetum and ferns occupying the margins of ephemeral lakes and post-disturbance environments. The Aspelintoppen Formation flora is similar in composition and ecology to other early Paleogene Arctic floras from the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, Alaska and north-east Russia, showing that Polar Broadleaved Deciduous Forests were a dominant part of the Arctic environment. Palaeoclimate estimates were derived from the 22 angiosperm morphotypes using both physiognomic and nearest living relative methods. CLAMP results {{are considered to be}} the most reliable and indicate that the Eocene climate of Svalbard was temperate with a mean annual temperature of 11. 6 °C, a warm month mean of 18. rC and a cold month mean of 4. 5 °C. Precipitation estimates indicate high levels of precipitation with growing season precipitation estimates from 320 to 1531 mm, and a strong wet or dry seasonal signal with 356 to 656 mm precipitation for the three wettest months and 112 to 247 mm for the three driest months. These estimates support sedimentary evidence that Eocene Arctic environments were seasonally warm and wet. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{plants of}} Paleocene age (62 to 59. 7 Ma) are {{preserved}} within lava sequences in the Hebrides and Northern Ireland. These lavas, collectively {{referred to as}} the British Tertiary Volcanic Group (BTVP), were formed due to rifting in the North Atlantic. The fossil floras represent forests that grew between the lavas in periods of quiescence, during which fluvio- lacustrine environments developed on the lava surfaces. The fossil plants provide information on the composition of the Paleocene vegetation and the climate during that interval. New collections of fossil plants have been made from the Isle of Skye and other collections from Ardtun on Mull were studied. The Allt Mor locality on Skye (60. 16 ± 0. 45 Ma) has provided the majority of the specimens for this study and represents a pond deposit where broadleaved angiosperm and conifer leaves accumulated. Fourteen angiosperm morphotypes have been identified, many of which show similarities to modern families, including the Platanaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Vitaceae, Cornaceae and <b>Trochodendraceae.</b> Conifer fossils include three ovulate cone types and eight shoot morphotypes attributed to the Cupressaceae and Pinaceae. The Allt Mor assemblage indicates that mixed coniferous forests developed within a palaeovalley, with the vegetation fringing the valley sides and colonising the floodplains of the valley floor. The vegetation of Allt Mor was dominated by climax conifers similar to Metasequoia, Sequoia, Chamaecyparis and Thuja. Broadleaved angiosperms such as Platanites, Trochodendroides, Corylites and "Platycarya cf" dominated the riparian margins and formed an understory of trees and shrubs in the conifer forests. Comparison with Paleocene floras from other Northern Hemisphere localities indicates that the floras of Skye are most {{similar to those of the}} Arctic, particularly those of Svalbard, Greenland and Canada, and were thus part of the Arcto-Tertiary floras of the northern high latitudes. Palaeoclimate estimates derived from the fossil angiosperm leaves indicate that the climate of Skye had a mean annual temperature (MAT) of - 5 °C to 9 °C, was seasonal with warm summers (warm month mean 19. 0 °C to 25. 8 °C) and cool to cold winters (cold month mean - 3. 0 °C to 4. 2 °C). Comparisons with the flora of Ardtun on Mull (60. 5 ± 0. 3 Ma) reveal that, although these floras share many of the same taxa, the flora is different, with angiosperms dominant, and the conifers that are common in the Allt Mor assemblage are rare or absent. The Ardtun flora also contains thermophilic plants such as Camptodromites major, C. multinervatus and Amentotaxus gladifolia, which are not present on Skye. Palaeoclimatedata from these fossil plants indicate significant cooling during the mid-Paleocene, confirmed by other marine and terrestrial proxies, marking a cool climate phase in the middle of the otherwise globally warm Paleocene climate.
