5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books {{that were in the}} cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same time from the same scribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{during an}} {{excavation}} by South Trafford Archaeological Group, fragments of Roman pottery {{were found in}} the area now occupied by the cemetery – previously the site of Urmston Old Hall – suggesting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a Roman settlement on the site. In the early 13th century, Lord Greenhalgh and his family lived at Highfield House (under what is now the M60 motorway).|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E

5000|$|The {{small body}} of {{evidence}} available for Runic texts suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> a been a separate locative case in early or Northumbrian forms of the language (e.g., [...] on rodi [...] "on the Cross").|$|R
50|$|Cline also {{suggests}} the possibility <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been a historical battle of Megiddo involving Josiah, since there's little historical attestation for it outside the Bible. For example, Josiah <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{been killed by}} Necho in some other circumstances.|$|R
5|$|To {{fill the}} void left by {{the demise of the}} Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The valleys of Pine Creek and its tributaries in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek, {{just a few miles from}} what became Upper Pine Bottom State Park.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the possibility <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
50|$|The {{estate was}} the {{property}} of Tewkesbury Abbey until {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. It was then sold and became part of the Stanway estate. There is some archaeological evidence <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> once <b>have</b> been a settlement around the chapel.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} that Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and {{evidence}} from Bornais suggests <b>that</b> settlers <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly due to a more relaxed political regime.|$|R
5000|$|Consequently, Lindow {{and other}} {{commentators}} <b>have</b> remarked <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> been any distinction intended between dark-elves and black-elves {{by those who}} coined and used those terms. Lotte Motz's paper on elves commingles, and hence equates [...] "dark-elves" [...] and [...] "black-elves" [...] from the outset.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} small finds of Roman coins {{throughout}} the Sheffield area, for example 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins {{were found at}} a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along {{with the name of}} the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Soil types {{mentioned}} in records are black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land {{and to a}} lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water. The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner of cows), gosasi (donor of cows), goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector of cows) attest to this. Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> existed a social hierarchy based on this. Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes); all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age.|$|E
5000|$|Matthews also {{mentions}} several {{locations where}} {{the existence of}} now-vanished turf mazes may be inferred from place names. In addition he states [...] "They are also recorded as having existed in Wales and Scotland." [...] It <b>has</b> been estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> once <b>have</b> been as many as 80 - 100 turf mazes in Britain.|$|R

25|$|Historian Christopher Snyder {{wrote that}} {{protocol}} dictated that Honorius address his correspondences to imperial officials, {{and the fact}} that he did not implies that the cities of Britain were now the highest Roman authority remaining on the island.

25|$|A few {{indicators}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> existed, in {{the same}} location, another structure, likely a temple to the goddess Nabia (as yet undiscovered).

25|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a two-pronged attack by Godwinson on Hardrada's army, {{making use of}} both the ford and perhaps {{the remnants of the}} earlier Roman bridge one mile to the south, information of which, and of the two road routes to the location from York, could have been gathered from Godwinson's earlier occupation of the city of York. However, no documentation exists to support this possibility.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{include a}} mid 13th-century piscina which is joined to three sedilia by continuous moulded scrollwork. Above this, two blocked archways rise and {{meet at a}} corbel carved with a sheep's head. This may be Norman and {{could have come from}} elsewhere in the church. There are also carvings representing monks' heads supporting statues. Apart from the main piscina, two others survive elsewhere in the church, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been two subsidiary altars at one point.|$|E
