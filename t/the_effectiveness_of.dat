5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. <b>The</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a 12 -nation study designed to test empirically the relationships between societal cultural values, individual social beliefs, and <b>the</b> perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> different influence strategies. The relationships between three types of broad influence strategy (persuasive, assertive, and relationship based) and four dimensions of individual beliefs (cynicism, fate control, reward for application, and religiosity) were examined. Three of Project GLOBE's cultural values (in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and future orientation) were selected to investigate their direct effects on <b>the</b> rated <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> influence strategies, and their possible interaction with dimensions of individual beliefs. Results showed that different dimensions of individual social beliefs predict <b>the</b> perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three types of influence strategy, and that cultural values can moderate the strength of the relationship between these dimensions of individual social beliefs and <b>the</b> perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> influence strategies.
