5|$|The {{first half}} of March opened with D.C. United {{participating}} in their final preseason <b>tune-up,</b> the 2011 Carolina Challenge Cup, played in Charleston, South Carolina. United, the defending champions, were paired up against the host Charleston Battery in the opening match of the tournament on 5 March. In the game, United emerged victorious 2–1, and moved into {{first place in the}} tournament table.|$|E
5|$|Judah was in {{line for}} a fight with Devon Alexander, after the latter's win against Juan Urango. He has also been linked to a match with Timothy Bradley, as he was {{considered}} as a possible replacement for Marcos Maidana. The former undisputed champion publicly challenged both of them {{on more than one occasion}} in 2010. Promoter Gary Shaw tried to begin negotiations with Judah for a potential bout in 2010. However, Judah declined the match but promised to fight Bradley and Alexander after a <b>tune-up</b> fight on July 16 at the Prudential Center in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring <b>tune-up</b> race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

After losing in a grass <b>tune-up</b> event in Birmingham, Li pulled out of every tournament she was to play in the summer, including Wimbledon and the US Open, citing a rib injury.|$|E
25|$|A {{shoulder}} injury forced Sharapova to miss {{most of the}} clay-court season {{for the second consecutive}} year, resulting in her only <b>tune-up</b> for the French Open being the İstanbul Cup, where she lost in the semifinals to Aravane Reza. She reached the semifinals of the French Open {{for the first time in}} her career, before losing to Ana Ivanovic. On grass, Sharapova was runner-up to Jelena Janković at the DFS Classic. Following that, she experienced her earliest Wimbledon loss since 2003 by losing in the fourth round to eventual champion Venus Williams.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1974, England faced three Tests against India and three against Pakistan. Overall, Greig {{averaged}} 41.5 with the bat and grabbed 14 wickets. His highlight was a century against India at Lord's. This was a good <b>tune-up</b> for the Ashes tour of Australia at year's end, where England would probably start favourite and Greig would be a key player. Shocked by the Australian fast bowling attack of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee, most English batsmen struggled in the first Test at Brisbane.

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{conducted}} a two-year field test involving over 300 homes {{to evaluate the}} US Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income fuel-oil-heated houses. One conclusion was that houses receiving oil-burner clean and <b>tune-ups</b> did not increase in system steady-state efficiency {{any more than a}} similar group of weatherized and control houses not receiving clean and <b>tune-ups.</b> A set of oil-burner performance goals proposed by the Alliance to Save Energy were not attained by most of the tuned-up oil systems, thereby not achieving a major benefit of heating-system programs from current implementation methods. Whole-system replacements produced higher-than-average savings and systems with flame-retention burners had higher steady-state efficiencies and used less fuel than normal burners. Other space-heating-system measures including setback thermostats were not statistically significant in reducing fuel-oil consumption. Secondary benefits of improved safety (such as lowering carbon monoxide concentrations in flue gases and inside houses) and reliability were present in weatherized houses, although not in as high a quantity as is often espoused...|$|R

25|$|The 1998 Grand Prix {{began on}} September 27 with {{the round of}} sixteen at the K-1 World Grand Prix '98 Opening Round where Hug faced off with Mark Russell, {{one of the few}} opponents in his career who he had a size {{advantage}} over. He scored a knockdown over England's Russell {{in the latter part of}} round one and finished the job in two with a second consecutive leg kick stoppage. In a <b>tune-up</b> fight ahead of the Grand Prix finals, Hug KO'd Masaaki Miyamoto with a spinning backfist moments after dropping him with the same technique at K-1 Japan '98 Kamikaze on October 28, 1998.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{their return}} to Lorient, which by that time had been heavily bombed by the Allies, the boat {{underwent}} repairs, first on its periscope and then the damaged port diesel and the electric motors. In addition to this new batteries were installed and the compressor was given a <b>tune-up.</b> Meanwhile, the crew were housed in air raid shelters rather than a barracks, as all the other accommodation had been destroyed. A number of crew members were sent away on promotion or training courses and in their place new personnel arrived. As a result, the crew composition changed considerably; the average age on board {{by the time of}} the third patrol was 23.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City began a {{significant}} decline in 1953. American railroads, which until this time had used coal-fueled locomotives, began switching to diesel fuel or using overhead electrical wires for powering engines. By {{the end of}} the year, almost no coal-fed locomotives were using the Ivy City rail yard. Although coal-fueled engines required frequent refueling, a diesel train could go for as many as three days without needing more diesel fuel. Steam-powered locomotives required almost daily <b>tune-up</b> and repair, but diesel-fueled engines rarely did. Significant layoffs at the Ivy City Yard occurred, deeply affecting Ivy City itself were many of these workers lived. The eastern roundhouse and a number of tracks were demolished in early 1954, and by 1956 the coal wharf and ash pits were also gone. As the railroad laid off workers, Ivy City also declined as a neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} {{preventive}} maintenance performed on an automobile, <b>tune-ups</b> can prevent myriad problems from occurring on a vehicle. The filters replaced can clog with use and prevent flow, starving {{the engine of}} fuel or air. Spark plugs have a recommended service lifetime of either 30,000 miles or, {{in the case of}} platinum or iridium plugs, 60,000 to 100,000 miles (96,000 to 160,000 km), and old spark plugs may cause engine misfire.|$|R
50|$|Another replicable PECI program, AirCare Plus, {{was also}} created in 2002. The program trains HVAC {{contractors}} to offer no-cost diagnostic <b>tune-ups</b> to utility customers’ HVAC systems. Increasing {{the efficiency of}} HVAC equipment saves energy from what is typically a home or commercial building’s largest energy consumer. It also increases equipment life and reduces the building’s environmental impact. AirCare Plus programs have been launched across the Pacific Northwest and California, saving more than 91 million kWh of electricity.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the tournament itself, several NASL teams participated in international indoor friendlies, and <b>tune-ups</b> for both the tournament and 1979 outdoor season.

25|$|Roddick did not {{fare well}} during the clay-court season, {{withdrawing}} from Rome due {{for personal reasons}} and from Madrid due to a stomach virus. Roddick then lost {{in the third round}} of the 2010 French Open to Teymuraz Gabashvili in straight sets. Failure at Roland Garros was followed by another disappointment when Roddick suffered his earliest ever exit in the 2010 Aegon Championships, a grass-court Wimbledon <b>tune-up</b> event. He was beaten by Dudi Sela in the third round. At Wimbledon, Roddick was seeded fifth, which was two spots higher than his ATP ranking of seven. He was defeated in the fourth round by world No. 82 Lu Yen-hsun of Taiwan in five sets. Like his final match with Roger Federer the previous year, his serve was broken only once during the match, in the fifth set.|$|E
25|$|Agassi had a poor {{start to}} 2006. He was still {{recovering}} from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. Agassi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the French Open. This caused his ranking {{to drop out of}} the top 10 for the last time. Agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a <b>tune-up,</b> and then Wimbledon. He was defeated in the third round by world no. 2 (and eventual runner-up) Rafael Nadal. Against conventions, Agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match. At Wimbledon, Agassi announced his plans to retire following the US Open. Agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the US Open.|$|E
