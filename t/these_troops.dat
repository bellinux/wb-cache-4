5|$|Around 120,000 prisoners {{from the}} French colonies were {{captured}} during the Battle of France. Most of <b>these</b> <b>troops,</b> around two-thirds, {{came from the}} French North African possessions of Tunisia, Morocco and, particularly, Algeria. Around 20 percent were from French West Africa. The rest were from Madagascar and Indochina. Influenced by Nazi racial ideology, German troops summarily killed between 1,000 and 1,500 black prisoners during the Battle of France. Among those captured who narrowly escaped execution was Léopold Sédar Senghor, an academic who would become the first President of independent Senegal in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} without {{difficulty}} by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of {{the forces of the}} Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> and never replaced them.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>troop</b> carrier {{groups have}} been re-designated several times since their {{establishment}} with changes in missions and aircraft (the Air Force Reserve Command now operates several different types of aircraft, not {{all of which are}} transports).

Troop 1,Christian Church with nelson Rodes as Scoutmaster, Troop 2, Centenary Methodist Church with Sandridge as Scoutmaster, and Troop 3, Presbyterian Church, no Scoutmaster listed. Of <b>these,</b> <b>Troop</b> 1 continues today as Troop 326.|$|R

5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US troops on Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure the city would occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed. It was {{responsible}} for two sub–units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops and a heavy weapons troop of fully trained commandos. The men in <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the Commando units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as Commando brigades.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the reports}} of <b>these</b> <b>troop</b> and {{equipment}} movements, NATO General Philip Breedlove said on 12 November that he could confirm that Russian troops and heavy equipment had crossed into Ukraine during the preceding week. In response, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry {{said that it was}} preparing for a renewed offensive by pro-Russian forces. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said [...] "there was and is no evidence" [...] to support NATO's statement.|$|R
50|$|At first Sweden troops won {{the battle}} against Russian vanguard and {{captured}} 5 or 6 cannons. Later main Russian forces arrived at the battlefield and attacked the Swedish <b>troops.</b> <b>These</b> Sweden <b>troops</b> repulsed the first Russian attack, but the Russians attacked again. Fresh Russian infantry began to encircle the Swedish forces that had {{to withdraw from the}} battlefield.|$|R

5|$|In total, Montcalm had 13,390 regular troops, Troupes de la Marine, and militia {{available}} in Quebec City {{and along the}} Beauport shore, as well as 200 cavalry, 200 artillery (including the guns of Quebec), 300 native warriors (including many Odawa under Charles de Langlade), and 140 Acadian volunteers, but most of <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> {{did not participate in}} the action. Many of the militia were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous irregulars were more used to guerilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all regulars.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali's {{successor}} was Hamad bin Thuwaini, {{who became}} sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained {{a close relationship}} with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade. In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police. Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>troops,</b> {{who were}} trained soldiers, were {{responsible}} for preparing the combat reports {{to be used as}} source material for the OKW communiqués. The propaganda companies were only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and sent them to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{signature of the}} musicians of this unit is the troop step, reminiscent of the ceremonial steps of the Household Regiments of the British Army. While playing their instruments, the musicians march forward at a slow, ceremonial pace, while pointing their toes, toe touching the ground first. After <b>these</b> <b>troop</b> steps, typically, the Fife and Drum Corps changes back to normal pace, stepping off at normal step, playing Yankee Doodle, to the applause of the crowds.|$|R

50|$|John George II of Anhalt-Dessau, clearly {{troubled by}} {{news of the}} troop build-up, asked Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel several times in late October, through Brandenburg colonel, Mikrander for the reasons for <b>these</b> <b>troop</b> movements. Wrangel, however, failed to answer and refused another attempt at {{dialogue}} by the Prince of Anhalt In mid-November the governor, John George II, had received assurance of an impending Swedish invasion, but in Berlin the exact causes and motives for such imminent aggression remained unclear.|$|R
5|$|Zieten had by {{this time}} brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become {{concerned}} {{at the sight of}} stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. <b>These</b> <b>troops</b> appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid.|$|E
5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{engagement}} between Thebes and Phocis, {{in which}} Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces {{met at the}} dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1,100.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. <b>These</b> <b>troops</b> were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E

2500|$|After Yan Xishan {{learned of}} the {{emergency}} facing Shi Zebo (史泽波) at Changzhi, he sent out reinforcements led by the deputy commander-in-chief of the 2nd Army Group, Peng Yubin (彭毓斌). Peng's units consisted of the 23rd Army, the 83rd Army, and other divisions totalling more than 20,000 men. [...] Learning <b>these</b> <b>troop</b> movements on September 28, 1945, the Communists planned an ambush in the area between Tunliu (屯留) and Xianghuan (襄垣), leaving the Southern Hebei (冀南) Column and local militia to maintain the siege of Changzhi, while redeploying Taihang (太行) and Taiyue (太岳) columns to the north.|$|R
5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} also promised, to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. <b>These</b> <b>troops</b> could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which {{at this stage of}} the war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British {{shipping}} rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as <b>these</b> <b>troops</b> came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered. A much-delayed Batavian expeditionary force, sent to retake {{control of the}} Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} a significant setback at the outset, when {{part of their}} small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Allied aircraft as they attempted {{to land on the}} coast behind the Australian defenders, the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields. Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence. <b>These</b> <b>troops</b> were steadily pushed back, but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942.|$|E
50|$|The {{exercise}} involved 10 {{divisions of}} the Indian Army and several squadrons of the IAF and a redeployment of troops at several places in North East India. The Indian Army moved 3 divisions to positions around Wangdung, where they were supplied and maintained solely by air. <b>These</b> <b>troop</b> reinforcements were {{over and above the}} 50,000 troops already present across Arunachal Pradesh. The military exercise coincided with statements from India's Chief of Army Staff Krishnaswamy Sundarji that India recognizes the major boundary differences with China and Indian deployments are intended to give Beijing the benefit of the doubt.|$|R
