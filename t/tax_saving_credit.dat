40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} persistence and value relevance of earnings attributable to <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> {{and the extent}} to which this persistence and value relevance differs from those of nontax earnings. After controlling for factors previously shown to be systematically associated with the tax component of earnings, results show that <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> are significant and statistically persistent but statistically less persistent than earnings from nontax sources. Results also reveal that the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> changes across <b>tax</b> regimes whereas earnings from nontax sources remain relatively unchanged. Contextual analysis shows that (1) the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is largely driven by firms in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, financial services, insurance and real estate industries, (2) the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is increasing in the R&D tax credit and (3) this persistence is increasing in settings where the ratio of foreign over domestic earnings is increasing. Additionally, the persistence and value relevance of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> is increasing for positive <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> implying a market reward (penalty) for lower (higher) <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> (reported effective <b>tax</b> rates). When I compare the results from my valuation tests with those from my persistence tests, I find that <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> are sometimes not persistent but value relevant and sometimes persistent but not value relevant whereas the persistence and value relevance of nontax earnings are always consistent. These findings are consistent with managerial opportunistic behavior, a market that suspects managerial opportunistic behavior or a stock market that does not understand fully the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> relative to nontax savings. Results from the Mishkin (1983) test show that the market appears to significantly overestimate both the persistence of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and nontax earnings, implying that securities are mispriced. This potential mispricing appears to be more severe for <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> implying that, on average, the market does not appear to understand fully the persistence and value relevance of the tax component of earnings. Finally, this study reconciles some of the mixed results of prior research and carries significant implications for policy makers, firm management, market participants and accounting researchers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>savings</b> {{associated}} with increased levels of debt are often thought {{to be an important}} source of returns for private equity funds conducting leveraged buyouts (LBOs).

Consequently, the <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> from increasing financial leverage essentially accrue to the previous shareholders rather than the private equity fund that conducts the LBO.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. The first two essays study the association between tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness. There is an emerging debate about whether firms tradeoff between <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and reported earnings. Essay 1 examines this relationship in the Canadian context and finds that tax aggressiveness is negatively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness, suggesting {{the existence of a}} tradeoff. However, closely-held firms seem to be making no tradeoffs between <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income. This essay also finds that closely-held firms are more aggressive in pursuing <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> compared to other firms. Essay 2 examines the tradeoff question in the North American context. I find that tax reporting aggressiveness is positively associated with financial reporting aggressiveness for U. S. firms (i. e., U. S. firms in general do not seem to tradeoff between the <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income), while negatively associated for Canadian firms (i. e., Canadian firms do seem to tradeoff between pursuit of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> and book income). Within the U. S. sub-sample, there is no difference in tradeoff behavior between closely-held and widely-held firms. Closely-held firms in Canada do not seem to tradeoff between book income and <b>tax</b> <b>savings,</b> thereby pursuing both tax aggressiveness and financial reporting aggressiveness simultaneously. Essay 3 focuses on financial reporting and examines the association between IFRS adoption and executive compensation. More specifically, I examine whether IFRS better reflects firms' and managers' performance. I find that accounting-based pay for performance sensitivity is stronger in the year of IFRS adoption. My results show that CFOs earned approximately $ 108, 000 more in the year of IFRS adoption. In contrast, the chief executive officer's (CEO) compensation did not change significantly in the year of IFRS adoption. I also find CF Os' bonus relative to CEO bonus increased by more than 20 % in the year of IFRS adoption...|$|R

Except for the calculation with CCF, all of them have to solve the circularity that arises between the cost of capital and the levered value. All the approaches match. However, the WACC for FCF takes into account the effect of <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> through the factor (1 -T) and the other approaches need to consider not only the <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> related to the interest charges, but the <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> associated with the losses in exchange for the debt. ...|$|R

To investigate this subject, we use a panel of German income tax accounting data, consisting of employees and other taxpayers with non-business income, to explore the relationship between expenses for tax preparation and tax liabilities. We find a negative link with expenses exceeding estimated <b>tax</b> <b>savings.</b> Specifically, one additional Euro yields an estimated <b>tax</b> <b>savings</b> of 72 cents in an OLS regression and 24 cents in a fixed-effects regression. This finding indicates that cross-section estimates are upward biased.

In consideration of time <b>savings,</b> combined <b>tax</b> and time <b>savings</b> also do not exceed expenses for any income quintile.
