5|$|In 1997, Maryland had a {{new head}} coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he {{immediately}} saw that Navy was a natural rival for his team, but {{was unaware of the}} past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, {{but it was not until}} after his relief that the idea materialized. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including <b>that</b> <b>against</b> Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator, and he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series would be even more meaningful. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005.|$|E

Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane <b>that,</b> <b>against</b> her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. At first, she becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave everyone and everything behind, including Sam, in order to hone her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will be wasted if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before <b>that</b> <b>against</b> Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E

25|$|According to the NGO Marias, {{there are}} several causes to the {{practice}} of domestic violence, such as alcoholism, adultery, jealousy, drugs, financial problems, and, according to professor Matthew Guttmann, anthropologist that studies masculinity for the Brown University, the main cause of domestic violence is sexism or machismo (in Portuguese).

25|$|This {{battle for}} the {{foundation}} of papal supremacy is connected with his championship of compulsory celibacy among the clergy and his attack on simony. Gregory VII did not introduce the celibacy of the priesthood into the Church, but he took up the struggle with greater energy than his predecessors. In 1074, he published an encyclical, absolving the people from their obedience to bishops who allowed married priests. The next year he enjoined them {{to take action against}} married priests, and deprived these clerics of their revenues. Both the campaign against priestly marriage and <b>that</b> <b>against</b> simony provoked widespread resistance.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} match was <b>that</b> <b>against</b> All West Indies. The West Indies team contained players from Trinidad, British Guiana and Barbados and was captained by Aucher Warner, {{the brother of}} Plum Warner. The tourists set their opponents 141 {{to win in the}} last innings which they achieved for the loss of 7 wickets, having been 41-6 at one stage. Richard Palairet was leading scorer in both the tourists' innings with 45 and 46. Clifford Goodman and Archie Cumberbatch took 9 wickets each for the West Indians as did Andrew Stoddart for the tourists. The leading batsmen for the West Indies were Harold Austin and Lebrun Constantine.|$|E

Two hundred and fifty-two of them represent one hundred and twenty-seven speeches of known title; and of six the fragments are comparatively large. Of these, the fragmentary speech For Pherenicus belongs to 381 or 380 BC, and is thus the latest known work of Lysias. In literary and historical interest, the first place among the extant speeches of Lysias belongs to <b>that</b> <b>Against</b> Eratosthenes (403 BC), one of the Thirty Tyrants, whom Lysias arraigns as the murderer of his brother Polemarchus.

In the County Championship, they let away 603 against Surrey, but saved the draw after {{trailing}} by 325 runs on first-innings. In the National League, Middlesex amassed 333 for 4 at Southgate - only to see that Gloucestershire scored even more, as they recorded only their second win in seven games, and <b>that</b> <b>against</b> second-placed Middlesex. A Bangladesh A side visited Bristol next, and Gloucestershire eventually won that friendly game by 130 runs despite being 72 for 7 in their first innings. However, they lost in the National League to Worcestershire, to go bottom of the Division 1 table. Gloucestershire were contented with a draw in their next match against Sussex in the Championship, never attempting the chase for 314 in 74 overs.|$|E

In addition to his advocacy for civil rights, he became a strong promoter of his middle-class fans vacationing in Hawaii and Miami Beach, Florida, formerly enclaves for the wealthy. He made a television movie in 1953, taking the controls of an Eastern Air Lines Lockheed Constellation airliner and flying to Miami, thus showing how safe airline travel had become. As a reserve officer, he used his public position to cajole the Navy into qualifying him as a Naval Aviator, and played <b>that</b> <b>against</b> the United States Air Force, who later successfully recruited him into the Air Force Reserve. At one time during the 1950s, Godfrey had flown every active aircraft in the military inventory.|$|E
25|$|According to Ahmadi Muslim belief, Jihad can {{be divided}} into three categories: Jihad al-Akbar (Greater Jihad) is <b>that</b> <b>against</b> the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; Jihad al-Kabīr (Great Jihad) refers to the {{peaceful}} propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen; Jihad al-Asghar (Smaller Jihad) is an armed struggle only to be resorted to in self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the Caliph. Ahmadi Muslims point out that as per Islamic prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.|$|E
