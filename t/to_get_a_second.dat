5|$|MSU's newest {{residential}} {{college is}} the Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though {{all the students}} will graduate with the same degree, MSU encourages students in the college <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> degree or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

50|$|On 10 March 2012, {{having come}} on as a {{substitute}} for Charles N'Zogbia, Weimann scored his first goal for Villa in the 92nd minute, giving the team a 1-0 victory over Fulham. The goal stemmed from Gary Gardner's shot when it was fumbled by the Fulham keeper and Weimann reacted fastest as he bundled in the winner and became an instant fans favourite. On 9 April he scored a goal against Stoke City in a 1-1 draw and was close <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> in the game.|$|R
2500|$|When Parnell {{heard of}} the success of the Irishtown meeting, he asked Davitt (who had been told to [...] "boycott" [...] it) <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{gathering}} there the following Sunday. At the second demonstration fresh speeches were made which attracted universal attention.|$|R
25|$|Davis {{significantly}} {{expanded the}} number of low-income children with state-subsidized health coverage. He signed laws to allow patients <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> opinion if their HMO denies treatment and, in limited cases, the right to sue. Davis signed legislation that provided HMO patients a bill of rights, including help-line to resolve disputes and independent medical review of claims. Under Davis, staff-to-patient ratios in nursing homes improved. However, Davis reneged on a campaign promise to expand low-cost healthcare to parents of needy children due to budget constraints.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, MSU {{accepted}} {{its first}} class of {{students for the}} Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU will encourage students in the college <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> degree or specialization. The new college will be MSU's fourth residential college, after James Madison College, the Lyman Briggs School, and the now-defunct Justin Morrill College. Although early proposals named the college after Nelson Mandela, university officials have not decided on a permanent name , {{saying that it is}} still too early to fix a permanent name to the college.|$|E
25|$|To {{practice}} medicine in territories of the British Empire, however, Banda was apparently required <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> medical degree; {{he attended the}} University of Edinburgh and was subsequently awarded a Scottish triple conjoint diploma (with post-nominals LRCP(Edin), LRCS(Edin) and LRCPSG) in 1941. His studies were funded by stipends of 300 pounds per year from the government of Nyasaland (to facilitate his return there as a doctor) and from the Scottish Presbyterian Kirk; neither of these benefactors {{was aware of the}} other. (There are conflicting accounts of this. He may still have been funded by Mrs. Smith.) When he enrolled for courses in tropical diseases in Liverpool the Nyasaland government terminated his stipend. He was forced to leave Liverpool when he refused on conscientious grounds to be conscripted as an Army doctor. He also became an elder of the Church of Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The Raiders semi-final {{appearance}} was brief, however. After being {{defeated by the}} Cronulla Sharks, the Raiders 6th-place finish {{was considered to be}} enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>a</b> <b>second</b> chance. However, <b>a</b> huge upset with 8th-place New Zealand defeating minor premiers Melbourne saw the Raiders eliminated.|$|R
50|$|Ben Dayan would {{head south}} to Be'er Sheva to join Hapoel for the 2003-04 season. There he would revive his career playing under Eli Guttman. This even led <b>to</b> him <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> chance <b>to</b> {{play on the}} {{national}} team, but he only featured in two friendlies against Azerbaijan and Moldova.|$|R
50|$|The Mountaineers {{threatened}} {{yet again}} {{in the bottom of}} the fourth. Kevin Vance (UConn) singled to lead off the inning but was thrown out by Newport left fielder Derek Jones (Washington State) when he tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>second.</b> <b>A</b> pair of singles, though, gave the Mountaineers a pair of one-out baserunners who advanced to second and third, respectively, on a groundout. However, Henry Dunn (Binghamton) flied out to end the threat.|$|R
500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, {{or whatever you want}} to call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|The unhappy Tambroni {{experiment}} tarnished Gronchi’s {{reputation for}} good, {{and until the}} end of his period of office he remained a lame-duck President. In 1962 he attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> mandate, with the powerful help of Enrico Mattei, but the attempt failed and Antonio Segni was elected instead. As he ceased to be Head of State, he became a life senator by right, according to the Italian Constitution. He died in Rome on October 17, 1978 at the [...] age of 91.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the season}} progressed with Richmond still struggling, Sproule came under pressure. Richardson {{guaranteed}} his position, {{but at the}} end of the year, the committee overruled Richardson and sacked Sproule. Incensed, Richardson walked out of Punt Road, which was in turmoil again. Desperately, Richmond turned back to Tony Jewell, who was appointed coach for a second time, the only man in the club's history <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> go at the job. Jewell later commented on the destruction wrought on the club during his four-year absence: [...] "the supporters were gone, the members were gone, the money was gone, ... a real shame." ...|$|E

60|$|According to {{the account}} of Master Cap, the wind had died away to a calm about midnight, or {{just as he was}} {{thinking}} of heaving-to, to sound, for islands ahead were beginning to be seen. At one A.M. it began to blow from the north-east, accompanied by a drizzle, and he stood off to the northward and westward, knowing that the coast of New York lay in the opposite direction. At half-past one he stowed the flying-jib, reefed the mainsail, and took the bonnet off the jib. At two he was compelled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> reef aft; and by half-past two he had put a balance-reef in the sail, and was lying-to.|$|E
60|$|Just then we saw {{the smaller}} bodies of cavalry {{stationed}} on our extreme right and left, and which were now reinforced by the three thousand sabres which we had held in reserve, flash out like arrows from their posts and fall upon the disordered flanks of Sorais' forces, and that charge decided {{the issue of the}} battle. In another minute or two the enemy was in slow and sullen retreat across the little stream, where they once more re-formed. Then came another lull, during which I managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> horse, and received my orders to advance from Sir Henry, and then with one fierce deep-throated roar, with a waving of banners and a wide flashing of steel, the remains of our army took the offensive and began to sweep down, slowly indeed, but irresistibly from the positions they had so gallantly held all day.|$|E
60|$|I {{spent five}} days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned. I saw most of the first Roman emperors.

30|$|This {{possibility}} {{is limited by}} important technical reasons. If the original examiner missed a lesion, no documentation exists of this.

This underlines the importance of selecting quality-assured/certified breast imaging centres for the original breast US examination. Notably, this is not true for mammography, which can be read by <b>a</b> <b>second</b> radiologist without it being necessary to repeat the test, (with only few exceptions due to technical deficits of the original mammogram).|$|R

40|$|International audience— Due to {{frictions}} and air compressibility, the dy-namics of {{pneumatic actuators}} {{is often described}} by a complex fourth-order non linear model. Therefore, simplifying the model of pneumatic actuators is of prime interest to design a controller.

The Artstein transformation is applied to this model <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> delay-free <b>second</b> order system. Then the delay-free system is stabilized using a robust nonlinear controller. The relevance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental tests...|$|R
