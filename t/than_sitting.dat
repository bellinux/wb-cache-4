5|$|In 1181 Bardulf was at {{the court}} of King Henry II of England, where he was steward, or dapifer, an office he held {{throughout}} Henry's reign and which he may have held throughout the next reign also. He held that office until Henry's death in 1189. From about 1185 until 1203, Bardulf was a royal justice almost annually, usually as a justice of eyre rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> at Westminster. He performed the duties of sheriff for the following counties: Cornwall from 1184–1187, Wiltshire from 1187 to 1189, Somerset during 1188 and 1189 along with Dorset during the same period, the counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire during 1190 and 1191, Yorkshire from 1191 to 1194, Westmorland from 1191 to 1199, Northumberland from 1194 to 1198, Cumberland during 1198 and 1199, Cornwall again from 1199 to 1200 along with Devonshire, and Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1200 to 1203. In 1194 Bardulf was mentioned on the escheat roll as responsible for the farm of lands held by Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York.|$|E

5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox One S, {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The capacitive power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> externally. Xbox One S requires a USB adapter to attach a Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the adapter with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E
5|$|The temple pattern could vary considerably, {{apart from}} the {{distorting}} effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as hypogea, were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at Wadi es-Sebua. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at Deir el-Bahari, the processional path ran {{up a series of}} terraces rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> on a single level. The Ptolemaic Temple of Kom Ombo was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at el-Amarna, in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.|$|E

25|$|Waterless urinals {{are often}} {{installed}} alongside UDDTs {{for the convenience}} of male users. Urinals also reduce the risk that male users standing over the UDDT for urination (rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> or squatting) inadvertently urinate into the feces vault or feces container. It is generally advisable that all UDDT users sit or squat to urinate. If urinals are provided, they can be used for those who prefer a standing position. Female urination devices are also available but they are not necessary for use with UDDTs as women normally sit or squat to urinate, a good posture which minimises urine from getting into the feces vault.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October {{the force}} {{departed}} Rochefort, evacuating the Île d'Aix and arrived back in England on 6 October. Mordaunt justified his decision {{by saying that}} the navy was needed to cover an incoming French fleet from the West Indies rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> indefinitely off Rochefort. Mordaunt's conduct was swiftly criticised by many officers who had taken part in the operation and had believed a landing had still been possible even at that late stage with the advantage of surprise lost. Wolfe and Howe were widely acclaimed for their efforts, but the disaster at Rochefort was compared to the failure of Admiral Byng to prevent the loss of Menorca the previous year, for which he had been shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Spanish regime, Calintaan became progressive, with Eligio Jimenez {{serving as}} the first {{appointed}} cabeza de barangay. Sablayan became a municipality during the American period, holding jurisdiction over barrios including Iriron and Calintaan. The municipal board of Sablayan was dominated by representatives from Calintaan. Some of these representatives were Leoncio Panganiban, Benigno Lontoc, Juanito Gonzales, Juan Credo, Pedro Credo, Agustin Esmelo, Francisco Esmelo, Eriberto Lineses, Atanacio Encomio,Pedro Romaquin, Constancio Villarosa, Cornelio Gasmin, Aniceto Apigo, Alberto Obispo, Amador Ulay and Vicente Isidro. Calintaan saw its first primary school open in 1914. During this period, the residents of Calintaan requested that they be established as a municipality themselves rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> as a barrio of Sablayan. They felt that Sablayan was too far away for easy governance. The petition was heard in Calapan, which at that time served as Provincial Council of all of Mindoro. Although some from the Sablayan municipal council supported the petitioners, their request was ultimately declined because it was feared that Calintaan did not have enough income to maintain a municipal government.|$|E

500|$|The Coens {{edited the}} film themselves, as is their custom. [...] "We prefer a {{hands-on}} approach," [...] Joel explained in 1996, [...] "rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> next to someone {{and telling them}} what to cut." [...] Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, {{they are required to}} use a pseudonym; [...] "Roderick Jaynes" [...] is credited with editing Barton Fink. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the movie, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were [...] "too conventional".|$|E
500|$|While {{the books}} {{could be said}} to {{comprise}} many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, [...] "deeply entrenched in the whole plot"; the writer prefers to let themes [...] "grow organically", rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers. Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and not leaving Harry, as she put it, [...] "stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction {{of the ways in which}} death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier Stuart Graham. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was [...] "better <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> on his backside and not trying anything". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was [...] "the biggest blunder" [...] Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was [...] "like being wise after the event".|$|E
40|$|Title: EMG Analysis of Back Muscles during various Types of Sitting Position Purposes: The {{purpose of}} the thesis is the {{assessment}} of EMG activity of back muscles while sitting on a chair without any back support, and while sitting on a gymball. Methods: Surface electromyography - recording EMG activity of back muscles (20 minutes sitting on a chair and 20 minutes sitting on a gymball). Results: The mean muscle activity of all probands while sitting on a chair is higher <b>than</b> while <b>sitting</b> on a gymball. Muscle fatigue of back muscles occurs faster when sitting on a gymball <b>than</b> when <b>sitting</b> on a chair. Key words: sitting position, gymball, surface electromyography, back muscle...|$|R

500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 24December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed. Concern over the plague meant that rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3October 1605. [...] The contemporaneous {{account of the}} prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament. [...] This {{may have been a}} government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found. [...] The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation. [...] Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining. [...] If the story is true, by 6December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. [...] They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. [...] The noise {{turned out to be the}} then-tenant's widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords—the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} {{claimed that the}} Exchequer {{was based on a}} similar Norman court; however, while there are many records of the Exchequer's work in England, {{there is no evidence of}} a similar body in pre-conquest Normandy. The first reliable records come from the time of Henry I, when the sole surviving Pipe roll from his reign shows the Exchequer working out of the king's palace as part of the curia regis. The curia regis followed the king as he travelled rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting</b> at any one fixed location, and was held in York, London and Northampton at various times. By the late 12th century it had taken to sitting in a fixed location (the one body of government in England to do so), and by the 1170s it was possible to distinguish the Exchequer's work from that of the other parts of the curia regis, although the king of the time considered the Exchequer to simply be an element of the curia; indeed, it was referred to as the Curia Regis ad Scaccarium, or King's Court at Exchequer. The word [...] "Exchequer" [...] derives from the chequered cloth laid on a table for the purposes of counting money. In the 1190s the Exchequer began separating from the curia regis, a process which continued until the beginning of the 13th century; academics have suggested that this is due to an increasing demand on the revenue side of the court, which led to part of the common law element being split off to form the Court of Common Pleas. Although the Exchequer of Pleas was the first common law court, it was also the last to separate from the curia regis.|$|E

2500|$|A squat toilet (also called [...] "squatting toilet", [...] "natural {{position}} toilet", or by {{many national}} names) is a toilet of any technology type (i.e. pit latrine, urine-diverting dry toilet, flush toilet etc.) {{which is used}} in a Squatting position rather <b>than</b> <b>sitting.</b> This means that the Defecation posture used is to place one foot {{on each side of}} the toilet drain or hole and to squat over it.|$|E
