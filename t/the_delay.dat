5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In Barker v.

Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{choice between}} {{outcomes}} with different delays to rein-forcement, most theories require that choice {{be governed by}} the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>delays,</b> not by <b>the</b> difference between them, a requirement also consistent with Weber’s law. Instead, delay-reduction theory and op-timal-foraging theory stipulate, under conditions of the present ex-periments, {{that the difference between}} <b>the</b> <b>delays,</b> and not <b>the</b> ratio between them, controls choice. This prediction was assessed using a procedure, widely used in foraging experiments, in which pigeons chose between accepting and rejecting either of two delays when offered. Across conditions, <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> either differed by a constant amount, with the ratio between <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> varying, or differed by changing amounts, with the ratio between <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> constant. In each of six experiments, rate of acceptance of <b>the</b> longer <b>delay</b> depended only on the difference between <b>the</b> two <b>delays</b> and not on the ratio between them, supporting delay-reduction and foraging theory...|$|R

5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of <b>the</b> <b>delay,</b> Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed <b>the</b> <b>delay,</b> at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{uncertainty and}} sensitivity analyses of <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> neutron fraction of light water reactor and sodium-cooled fast reactor fuel assemblies. For these analyses, the sampling-based XSUSA methodology {{is used to}} propagate cross section uncertainties in neutron transport and depletion calculations. Cross section data is varied according to the SCALE 6. 1 covariance library. Since this library includes nu-bar uncertainties only for the total values, it has been supplemented by delayed nu-bar uncertainties from the covariance data of the JENDL- 4. 0 nuclear data library. The neutron transport and depletion calculations are performed with the TRITON/NEWT sequence of the SCALE 6. 1 package. The evolution of <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> neutron fraction uncertainty over burn-up is analysed without and with <b>the</b> consideration of <b>delayed</b> nu-bar uncertainties. Moreover, the main contributors to the result uncertainty are determined. In all cases, <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> nu-bar uncertainties increase <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> neutron fraction uncertainty. Depending on the fuel composition, <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> nu-bar values of uranium and plutonium in fact give the main contributions to <b>the</b> <b>delayed</b> neutron fraction uncertainty for the LWR fuel assemblies.

5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> in releasing the game. Another reason for <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> was the game's unique nature, which made it a hard sell for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time.

In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E
5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E
