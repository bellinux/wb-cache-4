500|$|The thing must be movable, {{if it is}} to be stolen. Whilst an {{immovable}} thing {{cannot be}} carried away, the pre-classical extension to other types of interference with property means that immovable were not by their nature excluded. Gaius indicates that certain veteres ("ancients") believed that land could be stolen. This was also the view of Sabinus, but it was rejected by other classical jurists. A thing separated from the land could be stolen, however. Usucapio was particularly important with regard to land, and therefore the exclusion may have been retained to help the good faith possessor of land <b>to</b> <b>usucapt.</b> Res sanctae and religiosia were covered by separate delicts; and one could not steal a res nullius. [...] One can commit furtum of one's own property, for example by taking back a thing pledged to a creditor, or by secretly reclaiming one's own thing from a good faith possessor. Free persons could also be stolen, for example, children; a wife in manu; indicati and auctorati. This was probably a hang-over from a time when dominium (ownership), manus and potestas were indistinct and not formally separate. Res hereditariae could not be stolen, perhaps for want of a suitable plaintiff with a sufficient interest.|$|E
