25|$|Economic losses—from lost {{sales revenue}} and wages—are {{estimated}} between $500million and $3billion. Moody's Analytics indicated the highest losses, stating $2.5–3billion; however, the storm's occurrence {{on a weekend}} accounted for less losses than what would otherwise be expected. Planalytics placed losses at $850million and IHS Global Insight estimated losses between $500million and $1billion. Although an estimate was not provided, AON Benfield placed losses in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> of dollars, noting similarities to the Blizzard of 1996 which inflicted $4.6billion in economic losses. Despite the expected major losses, the rush to buy supplies ahead of the storm's arrival may mitigate the overall impact. The airline industry suffered approximately $200million in lost revenue.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Abramovich and Boris Berezovsky, an {{associate}} of President Boris Yeltsin, acquired the controlling interest in the large oil company Sibneft. The deal was within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100million for half of the company, above the stake's stock market value of US$150million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions. The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, {{to suggest that the}} real cost of the company should have been in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> of dollars. Abramovich later admitted in court that he paid huge bribes (in billions) to government officials and obtained protection from gangsters to acquire these and other assets (including aluminium assets during the aluminium wars).|$|E
25|$|As an {{organization}} of central banks, the BIS seeks to make monetary policy more predictable and transparent among its 60-member central banks, except {{in the case of}} Eurozone countries which forfeited the right to conduct monetary policy in order to implement the euro. While monetary policy is determined by most sovereign nations, it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and especially the fate of export economies. Failures to keep monetary policy in line with reality and make monetary reforms in time, preferably as a simultaneous policy among all 60 member banks and also involving the International Monetary Fund, have historically led to losses in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> as banks try to maintain a policy using open market methods that have proven to be based on unrealistic assumptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. <b>The</b> <b>billions</b> of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure {{was about the same}} whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer {{at the end of the}} war than at the beginning.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> of dollars of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, {{with the result that}} one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going to).|$|E
25|$|Human {{variation}} is highly non-concordant: {{most of the}} genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. Skin and hair color are not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. Human species do not share the same patterns of variation through geography. Skin color varies with latitude and certain people are tall or have brown hair. There is a statistical correlation between particular features in a population, but different features are not expressed or inherited together. Thus, genes which code for superficial physical traits—such as skin color, hair color, or height—represent a minuscule and insignificant portion {{of the human genome}} and do not correlate with genetic affinity. Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other. Even within the same region, physical phenotype is not related to genetic affinity. Despite pygmy populations of South East Asia (Andamanese) having similar physical features with African pygmy populations such as short stature, dark skin, and curly hair, they are not genetically closely related to these populations. Genetic variants affecting superficial anatomical features (such as skin color)—from a genetic perspective, are essentially meaningless—they involve a few hundred of <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> of nucleotides in a person's DNA. Individuals with the same morphology do not necessarily cluster with each other by lineage, and a given lineage does not include only individuals with the same trait complex.|$|E
