5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed <b>that</b> <b>males</b> and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail.

5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>males</b> would venture away from the nest {{in order to attract}} females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{studies and}} polling data from sub-Saharan Africa {{indicate}} that many individuals may mistakenly believe <b>that</b> <b>male</b> circumcision directly protects women from contracting HIV. This study examines whether individuals who learn <b>that</b> <b>male</b> circumcision reduces female-to-male HIV transmission also erroneously infer {{a reduction in}} direct male-to-female transmission risk (i. e. from an HIV-positive man to an uninfected woman). We used data on Malawian men (n = 917) randomized to receive information about voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) and HIV risk in 2008 and {{a random sample of}} their wives (n = 418). We found that 72 % of men and 82 % of women who believed <b>that</b> <b>male</b> circumcision reduces HIV risk for men also believed that it reduces HIV risk for women. Regression analyses indicated that men randomly assigned to receive information about the protective benefits of circumcision were more likely to adopt the erroneous beliefs, and that the underlying mechanism was the formation of the belief <b>that</b> <b>male</b> circumcision reduces HIV risk for men. The results suggest the need for VMMC campaigns to make explicit <b>that</b> <b>male</b> circumcision does not directly protect women from HIV-infection...|$|R

5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits <b>that</b> <b>males</b> favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating <b>that</b> <b>males</b> that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate <b>that</b> <b>males</b> wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted <b>that</b> <b>males</b> were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>males</b> sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except <b>that</b> <b>males</b> {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in <b>that</b> <b>males</b> {{are found}} in deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E

5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have historically}} been proposed for the variation seen in the skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs. Brown and Schlaikjer suggested that there was sexual dimorphism {{in the degree of}} doming, and hypothesized that flat-headed specimens such as AMNH5450 (Ornatotholus) represented the female morph of Stegoceras. This idea was supported by a 1981 morphometric study by Champan and colleagues, which found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> had larger and thicker domes. After other flat-headed pachycephalosaurs were discovered, the degree of doming was proposed to be a feature with taxonomic importance, and AMNH5450 was therefore considered a distinct taxon from 1979 onwards. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues instead proposed that the inflation of the dome was an ontogenetic feature that changed with age, based on a histological study of an S. validum skull that showed the dome consisted of vascular, fast-growing bone, consistent with an increase in doming through age. These authors found that the supposedly distinct features of Ornatotholus could easily be the results of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|The size {{difference}} between sexes {{has led to}} the suggestion that the Rodrigues solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this deeply religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons. It has been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive mating display. However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; most other pigeons are monogamous as well. A 2015 article proposed <b>that</b> <b>males</b> invited females into their territories as secondary mates, which would result in the resident female acting aggressively towards the newcomer. Similar behaviour is seen in species that practice resource-defence polygyny. The territories probably provided all the food the birds needed in adittion to acting as breeding-areas, and there was probably intense competition for favourable territories. The fact that Rodrigues island shrank by 90% {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene may also have contributed to such competition over territories, and thereby furthered sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|The splendid fairywren (Malurus splendens), {{also known}} simply as the splendid wren or more colloquially in Western Australia as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the Maluridae family. It is found {{across much of the}} Australian continent from central-western New South Wales and southwestern Queensland over to coastal Western Australia. It inhabits predominantly arid and semi-arid regions. Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism, the male in breeding plumage is a small, long-tailed bird of predominantly bright blue and black colouration. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression <b>that</b> <b>males</b> were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. It comprises several similar all-blue and black subspecies that were originally considered separate species.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements.

The second is <b>that</b> <b>male</b> reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|R
5|$|The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), {{also known}} as the superb blue-wren or colloquially as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the family Maluridae, common and familiar across southeastern Australia. The species is sedentary and territorial, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression <b>that</b> <b>males</b> were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} visible {{difference}} between the sexes {{in most of the}} family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found <b>that</b> <b>males</b> were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate <b>that</b> <b>males</b> who self-harm may also be at {{a greater risk of}} completing suicide.|$|E

5|$|With time, {{the idea}} that the differing skulls might be {{representative}} of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, Ostrom and Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, Triceratops horridus. Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region (modern examples being the elephant and the giraffe in modern Africa). To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus lineage was composed of females, the T.calicornis-T.elatus lineage was made up of males, and the T. obtusus-T. hatcheri lineage was of pathologic old males. His reasoning was <b>that</b> <b>males</b> had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, <b>that</b> <b>males</b> succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means <b>that</b> <b>males</b> can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E
