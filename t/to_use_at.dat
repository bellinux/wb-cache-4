5|$|Smartsheet {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of its}} first year, it had only 10,000 users. The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly. Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|This tiara, made by Cartier in 1936, was {{purchased}} by the Duke of York (later George VI) for his wife (later the Queen Mother) three weeks before they became king and queen. It has a rolling cascade of 16 scrolls that converge on two central scrolls topped by a diamond. Altogether, it contains 739 brilliants and 149 baton diamonds. The tiara was given to Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944, and was borrowed by Princess Margaret, who used it at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Later, Elizabeth lent the Halo Tiara to Princess Anne, before giving her the Greek Meander Tiara in 1972. The Halo Tiara was lent to the Duchess of Cambridge <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> her wedding to Prince William in 2011.|$|E

Four players can play on one machine cooperatively, and players can join or leave at any time. The game also features online play for up to four players, a first for the series.

5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered to take {{one or both of the}} Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E

25|$|The {{books in}} the Super Dog Zam Grief series offer {{families}} with grieving children a self-help tool <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> home. The workbooks were developed specifically for three different age groups: 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12 years. The books were co-authored by Binau's youngest son, Andy Binau (creator of The Super Dog ZAM and author of My Doggy Diary), and daughter, Malene Shak (a certified Montessori teacher).|$|E

25|$|The S-parameters {{are members}} of a family of similar parameters, other {{examples}} being: Y-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters. They differ from these, in the sense that S-parameters do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, matched loads are used. These terminations are much easier <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> high signal frequencies than open-circuit and short-circuit terminations. Moreover, the quantities are measured in terms of power.|$|E
25|$|During September, three Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) Short 827 floatplanes {{and their}} crews, under Squadron Commander Robert Gordon, arrived and were {{attached}} to the half-flight.

25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly silicon solid-state rectifiers in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or copper oxide. While selenium rectifiers were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> low frequencies. Both selenium and copper oxide rectifiers have somewhat better tolerance of momentary voltage transients than silicon rectifiers.|$|E
25|$|Porter {{sold the}} {{terminal}} {{at the island}} airport in Toronto to Nieuport Aviation Infrastructure Partners GP in January 2015. According to Deluce, {{this meant that the}} airline was debt-free, although it would now pay to lease the facility. The sale was estimated to be in the range of 750 million. Being debt-free was considered a good position to be in, if it were to buy Bombardier CS100 jets <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> the island airport. However, in November 2015, the federal government announced it would not support the proposal to expand the island airport.|$|E

This reduces {{the volume of}} gas used, so that a smaller cylinder, or cylinders, than open-circuit scuba {{may be used for}} the equivalent dive duration, and giving the ability to spend far more time underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers also produce far less bubble volume and less noise than scuba, which makes them attractive to military, scientific and media divers.

25|$|In 2009, Wyoming Area School District {{reported}} employing over 170 {{teachers with}} a salary range of $39,699 to $116,986 and a median teacher salary of $59,616. Teachers work 7 {{hours per day}} with a duty-free 30-minute lunch period and a daily prep period. In addition to salary, the teachers' compensation includes: health insurance (with no employee contribution), life insurance, paid funeral leave, 10 paid sick days, 2 personal days, and reimbursement for college courses. At retirement, teachers receive $30 per unused sick day and can receive, through district funding, 40% of final salary retirement bonus and health insurance until age 65. Teachers receive extra compensation for additional duties and for extracurricular advising and sports coaching. The teacher's union is given 10 days with pay <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> its discretion for teachers to conduct union business.|$|E
25|$|Bonds's {{trial was}} set for March 2, 2009, but delayed by appeals, after the judge {{excluded}} drugs tests and other evidence {{that could not be}} specifically tied to Bonds without the testimony of Greg Anderson, who is alleged to have provided steroids to Barry Bonds when he was Bonds personal trainer and linked to Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO). Law professor Peter Keane called the prosecutors' move a blunder, although an account by another published attorney disagreed. In June 2010, however, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence should be excluded. On August 7, 2010, it was reported that U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco had rescheduled the trial for March 21, 2011. On Friday, December 17, 2010, it was reported that attorneys for Bonds, citing the appeals court ruling, filed papers asking the judge to forbid testimony of current and former baseball players linked to BALCO or the steroids scandal, and not to permit use of Anderson's drug ledgers and calendars, as well as other documents from BALCO which the prosecution was seeking <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>at</b> the trial in spite of the appeals court ruling.|$|E
