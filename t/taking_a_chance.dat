25|$|After {{graduating from}} Yonkers High School in 1939, Caesar left home, intent on a musical career. He arrived in Manhattan {{and worked as}} an usher and then a doorman at the Capitol Theater there. He was ineligible to join the musicians' union in New York City until he {{established}} residency, but he found work as a saxophonist at the Vacationland Hotel, a resort located in the Catskill Mountains of Sullivan County, New York. Mentored by Don Appel, the resort's social director, Caesar played in the dance band and learned to perform comedy, doing three shows a week. He audited classes in clarinet and saxophone at the Juilliard School of Music. In 1939, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard, and was stationed in Brooklyn, New York, where he played in military revues and shows. Vernon Duke, the composer of Autumn in New York, April in Paris, and <b>Taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>Chance</b> on Love, was at the same base and collaborated with Caesar on musical revues.|$|E

He quickly read the first three novels and was excited that [...] "Hollywood was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to put over $100 million to adapt these inventive children's books onto screen". Handler, who wrote eight drafts of the script for Sonnenfeld, was replaced by Robert Gordon in May 2003. Handler approved of the changes that were made to his original screenplay. [...] "I was offered credit on the film for screenwriting by the Writers Guild of America," [...] Handler continued, [...] "but I didn't take it because I didn't write it.

He wrote: [...] "Under {{the enormous}} pressure of her $40 million deal with Virgin Records, Jackson had to deliver something big enough to put her {{on a first-name basis}} with the world... 'janet.' isn't perfect, but it should be enough to make her the Queen of Pop." [...] "Dammit, Janet!," [...] marveled Melody Maker. [...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia." [...] "Janet will please most people," [...] remarked The Daily Telegraph, [...] "because it is crammed with the sort of tender, joyous pop music that lingers long after smarter records have been forgotten." ...|$|E

In the early scenes she [...] "swaps her bronzed tan for alabaster skin, smokey eyes and pale lipstick". In the next scene {{she can be}} [...] "seen looking wistfully into the distance in a slinky floor-length black dress with brown hair extensions cascading over her shoulders", whilst in a third scene she is depicted as an [...] "Egyptian goddess". Each scene incorporates [...] "dance shots interspersed with sequences in which the focus falls on the two stars alone, seemingly searching each other, as it were ... experimenting more with her looks and even <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> with Lady Gaga-esque outfits for her dancers, including veils that cover their faces and black leotards."

500|$|Tom Carson, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Village Voice, praised the episode, {{which he said}} [...] "featured some amazing sick jokes about American affluence and obliviousness". Dianne Williamson of the Telegram & Gazette praised [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] for <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> with the source material, and said, [...] "Often I'm in awe at the courage of these [...] creators." [...] The Advertiser of Lafayette, Louisiana, called the episode [...] "hysterical" [...] and particularly praised its satire of American consumerism.

500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The {{prospect}} of his return to professional football {{was the subject of}} much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa. He did think, however, that Vick would be [...] "unstoppable" [...] if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept for}} The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty was first {{developed}} by Lorna Smith, {{who was in}} charge of the layout of several Filmation series at the time. Being a [...] "big cat lover", she suggested to Scheimer that they create a series led by cats; however, according to Scheimer, he didn't remember their conversation but because [...] "she raised a fuss" [...] regarding the issue, Smith ultimately received credit for the idea in the show's credits. Scheimer claimed in a 2012 autobiography, co-written by Andy Mangels, that the production of the series was also extremely problematic. In 1974, NBC reduced the episode orders on its green-lit series from sixteen to thirteen episodes, which Scheimer felt made it very difficult to sell the show to different markets around the world. He said that with just thirteen episodes, [...] "you were always <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that you were producing something that was going to have no value except on commercial television in the United States".|$|E

Anita Camrata, {{executive vice president of}} MGM Music explained the choice in 2002: [...] "With every other artist, you're <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> But with Madonna, she has an extraordinary track record. She has written songs for films before and they were always perfect." [...] By mid-February 2002 sources from the film set revealed that negotiations were under process for Madonna to sing the title song and make a cameo appearance in Die Another Day. The song deal was confirmed in mid-March with journalists reporting a complex contract which might have cost MGM around one million dollars, including Madonna's fees for music and acting, promotion, the single release and the music video.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe dream. I didn't ever {{think it would be a}} reality, but it came true. He was <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E

40|$|Folklore has it {{that the}} {{comparatively}} low proportion of self-employed in Germany is in part due to a habit that might be termed 'stigmatisation of failure': <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> second <b>chance</b> to build one's own firm after failing as a self-employed is said to be much more difficult here than in other countries. This paper uses data from a large recent survey in ten German planning regions to document that 18 percent of today?s firm owners founded a firm in the past that went out of business in between, and that 8 percent of people who went out of business with their former firm are actively engaged in starting a new business today. The determinants of such a restart are investigated econometrically. It turns out that both individual and regional factors are important for the probability of <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> second chance: This probability is negatively related to age, attitude towards risk, and the share of persons in the region who failed in the past, while it is positively related to personal contacts with a young entrepreneur and the regional share of nascent entrepreneurs...|$|R
60|$|It wasn't {{the first}} time Strether had sat alone in the great dim church--still less was it {{the first of his}} giving himself up, so far as {{conditions}} permitted, to its beneficent action on his nerves. He had been to Notre Dame with Waymarsh, he had been there with Miss Gostrey, he had been there with Chad Newsome, and had found the place, even in company, such a refuge from the obsession of his problem that, with renewed pressure from that source, he had not unnaturally recurred to a remedy meeting the case, for the moment, so indirectly, no doubt, but so relievingly. He was conscious enough that it was only for the moment, but good moments--if he could call them good--still had their value for a man who by this time struck himself as living almost disgracefully from hand to mouth. Having so well learnt the way, he had lately made the pilgrimage more than once by himself--had quite stolen off, <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> unnoticed <b>chance</b> and making no point of speaking of the adventure when restored to his friends.|$|R

60|$|But of {{all this}} on that first morning I knew {{no more than a}} fly.

I thought Falesá seemed to be the right kind of a place; and the more I drank the lighter my heart. Our last trader had fled the place at half an hour's notice, <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> passage in a labour ship from up west. The captain, when he came, had found the station closed, the keys left with the native pastor, and a letter from the runaway, confessing he was fairly frightened of his life. Since then the firm had not been represented, and of course there was no cargo. The wind, besides, was fair, the captain hoped he could make his next island by dawn, with a good tide, and the business of landing my trade was gone about lively. There was no call for me to fool with it, Case said; nobody would touch my things, every one was honest in Falesá, only about chickens or an odd knife or an odd stick of tobacco; and the best I could do was to sit quiet till the vessel left, then come straight to his house, see old Captain Randall, the father of the beach, take pot-luck, and go home to sleep when it got dark.
