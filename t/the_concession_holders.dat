40|$|There {{is growing}} {{awareness}} of the need to sustainably manage forests in Central Africa. This paper reviews the current state in Gabon within the national context. Forests play a very important role in Gabon in view of their extensive area as well as their contribution to the national economy. There are three main forest regions: coastal sedimentary basin, North-East, and Central Gabon. Forest utilisation is largely controlled by foreign capital and includes few tree species, mainly Okoumé (75 % in 1997), with comparatively low volumes extracted per hectare. Export of Okoumé and Ozigo was until recently a monopoly of SNBG, a state company now experiencing a deep crisis. The timber market is affected by the Asian crisis repercussions. Since the 50 s the government, as owner, has tried to sustainably manage the forests. Pilot management schemes were undertaken and all forest concessions are required by law to have management plans. The main problem for the government is its capacity to enforce forest management, and for <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>holders</b> the profitability of their investments. There are internal incentives (better forecast of harvest, rationalisation of forest road network, guarantee of access to managed forests), as well as international incentives, such as pressure for ecocertification and assistance to forest management. At national level the forest law reform will make sustainable management compulsory. Such constraints and incentives are not fully identified, however there is clearly increasing involvement of logging companies: feasibility studies on management of timber concessions, forest management agreements between government and concession holders. The cost of sustainable forest management appears globally acceptable. The success of a forest management policy in Gabon will depend on the capacity of the government to incorporate management as a natural component of forest utilisation, and control implementation...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the highway started after the {{separation}} of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, when the Malaysian government decided to make Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) as Malaysia's new national port as a replacement of Singapore. As a result, the government planned to build a highway connecting Port Klang to Kuala Lumpur by upgrading the former Kuala Lumpur-Klang Highway (Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Klang) (opened to traffic on 14 January 1959) to a full motorway by replacing the existing at-grade intersections with interchanges, making the Federal Highway as Malaysia's first expressway. The Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya Traffic Dispersal Scheme was implemented in 1974 under the surviliance of the Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR). This scheme includes the Kuala Lumpur Inner Ring Road, Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 1, Jalan Syed Putra and Federal Highway Route 2 (Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya). Funded by a loan granted by the World Bank, the upgrade works for the Federal Highway from Subang Airport Interchange to Kuala Lumpur started from 1974 until 1977. The highway was originally a 4-lane limited access highway except for the Petaling Jaya stretch where it became 6-lane highway. However, in 1992 PLUS Expressways, <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>holder</b> of North-South Expressway has upgraded the entire highway to a 6-lane highway with two toll plazas, Batu Tiga and Sungai Rasau.

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{relative}} importance of medicine attributes and decision-making preferences of patients with higher or lower levels of insurance coverage in a publicly funded health care system. Design and setting Cross-sectional telephone survey of randomly selected regular medicine users aged = 18 years in the Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia. Main variables studied Questions about 27 medicine attributes and active involvement in decisions to start a new medicine. Results After adjustment, there were few differences between <b>the</b> 408 <b>concession</b> card <b>holders</b> (high insurance) and 410 general beneficiaries (low insurance) in their assessment of the importance of medicine attributes. For both groups, the explanation of treatment options, establishing the need for the medicine, and medicine efficacy and safety were the most important considerations. Medicine costs, the treatment burden and medicine familiarity were less important; the views of family and friends ranked lowest. There was a statistically significantly greater influence of the regular doctor for <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> card <b>holders</b> than general beneficiaries (93. 6 vs. 84 %, adjusted OR 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 31, 5. 99). <b>Concession</b> card <b>holders</b> were more likely to favour doctors having more say in the decision-making process (crude OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 28, 2. 24), and more likely to report the most recent treatment decision being made by the doctor alone, compared with general beneficiaries (61. 2 vs. 40. 3 %). Conclusion Medicine need, efficacy and safety are viewed as paramount for most patients, irrespective of insurance status. While patients report the importance of participation in treatment decisions, delegation of decision making to the doctor was common in practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an implementation, {{based on}} a multi-agent system, of a {{management}} system for automated negotiation of electricity allocation for charging electric vehicles (EVs) and simulates its performance. The widespread existence of charging infrastructures capable of autonomous operation is recognised as a major driver towards the mass adoption of EVs by mobility consumers. Eventually, conflicting requirements from both power grid and EV owners require automated middleman aggregator agents to intermediate all operations, for example, bidding and negotiation, between these parts. Multi-agent systems are designed to provide distributed, modular, coordinated and collaborative management systems; therefore, they seem suitable to address the management of such complex charging infrastructures. Our solution consists {{in the implementation of}} virtual agents to be integrated into the management software of a charging infrastructure. We start by modelling the multi-agent architecture using a federated, hierarchical layers setup and as well as the agents' behaviours and interactions. Each of these layers comprises several components, for example, data bases, decision-making and auction mechanisms. The implementation of multi-agent platform and auctions rules, and of models for battery dynamics, is also addressed. Four scenarios were predefined to assess the management system performance under real usage conditions, considering different types of profiles for EVs owners', different infrastructure configurations and usage and different loads on the utility grid (where real data from <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> <b>holder</b> of <b>the</b> Portuguese electricity transmission grid is used). Simulations carried with the four scenarios validate the performance of the modelled system while complying with all the requirements. Although all of these have been performed for one charging station alone, a multi-agent design may in the future be used for the higher level problem of distributing energy among charging stations.

40|$|This article explores recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} remunicipalisation in the German electricity market. Actually, the established socio-technical regime of the electricity market generates considerable inertia and impedes fundamental change. But regarding the energy transition (German Energiewende) a fundamental change is needed; it is essential to promote a broader range of actors and institutions to overcome the existing regime resistance. Many local policy-makers and municipalities in Germany discover chances and possibilities for local action which arise from remunicipalisation. The establishment of municipal power utilities offers the opportunity of implementing an independent energy policy at local level which is critical in creating a transformation to a sustainable energy system based on renewable energies and energy efficiency. The municipal ownership allows a strong governance towards more political influence on the local energy market but the current court decisions regarding the takeover of electricity grids taken by <b>the</b> former <b>concession</b> <b>holder</b> of municipal utilities (Stadtwerke) in Germany make it difficult to realise the full potential of energy policy at a local level.
