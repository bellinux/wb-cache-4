Detailed studies of the events surrounding the extinction have raised questions about some of the details and interpretations in earlier histories.

Thus walking around the sculpture <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it <b>better</b> creates a temporal sequence of 2-dimensional images in the brain.|$|R

2500|$|Still, the {{possibilities}} of dynamic change in Seventh-day Adventist beliefs are not unlimited. [...] Those landmark doctrines are non-negotiables in Adventist theology. Collectively they have provided the Seventh-day Adventists with an identity. [...] The pillars of their faith—the Bible doctrines that define who they are as a people—have been thoroughly studied out in the Scripture and have been attested to by the convicting power of the Holy Spirit. [...] As Ellen White put it, [...] "When the power of God testifies {{as to what is}} truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth. ... Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are not truth. [...] The truth for this time, God has given us as a foundation for our faith. [...] Robert Johnston noted, “Without repudiating the past leading of the Lord, it [...] seeks even <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>better</b> what that leading was. [...] It is always open to better insights to learn—to seek for truth as for hid treasure. … [...] Adventists are still pilgrims on a doctrinal journey who do not repudiate the way marks, but neither do they remain stopped at any of them.” Ellen further said that there is more truth to be revealed and that true doctrine will stand close investigation. [...] But there is a solid foundation to build new truth upon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} process for Vices & Virtues took {{much longer than}} the band intended. The band was [...] "very confused" [...] after the split from Ross and Walker, desiring instead to go on tour <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>better.</b> As evidenced above, [...] "Oh Glory" [...] and [...] "New Perspective" [...] were largely recorded {{during the summer of}} 2009 with producer John Feldmann. [...] "These songs are just Brendon and I having fun, because that's what we want to do," [...] Smith told MTV News. Shortly after the departure of Ross and Walker, Smith revealed the band was recording: [...] "We're working on an album now that, hopefully, takes the best parts from both of our records ... because we love them both and are really proud of them." [...] While on the Blink-182 Reunion Tour, Smith showed Blink-182 singer/bassist Mark Hoppus several demos for the album, in hopes that he would produce a song or two. Hoppus confirmed in August 2009 that he was committed to producing one [...] "really strong" [...] track on the record, as well as possible others if allowed. During this time, Urie told news outlets the band had [...] "about 10 songs" [...] ready to consider for the band's third album. In the beginning stages, a song featuring Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, whom Urie later described as [...] "super nice," [...] was set to appear on the new album, but the song is absent from the final track listing. The band initially planned to record the album in fall 2009, to be released the beginning of 2010.|$|E
