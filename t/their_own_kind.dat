5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind,</b> both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind,</b> when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{the only}} species of the genus Bagrichthys that is traded for the {{aquarium}} hobby. When these fish are first imported, they are often young and in bad condition. It has been recommended to acclimate these fish at a high temperature (about 29°C or 85°F).

25|$|According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing {{of society}} is not, {{or not the}} only, {{intrinsically}} good thing.

As an effort to solve that problem, it needs guidance for civil servants to do their daily tasks. We proposed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) as an answer. Through its application, every activity is described into every step, which also contains persons in charge for those acts. More of those, SOP also describes input, time consumed and output for every activity level which are grouped inside standardized-quality section. Then we conclude that Standard Operating Procedures are a shining-path to make effective, efficient and economics bureaucracy, come into reality...|$|R

Charles Martel invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced back again to Frankish territory under his control.

Also, where multiple species of gleaning birds forage in the same area, they may show niche segregation; for example, one species may stick to conifers while another species inhabits broadleaf trees, or they may even divide up a habitat, with smaller species feeding among higher, smaller tree branches and larger species staying on lower, larger branches.|$|E
25|$|They are a {{hardy and}} useful {{aquarium}} fish despite having a coloration {{that is by}} no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists are fascinated by the habits of these fish.

40|$|In {{the roughly}} twenty {{years between the}} end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Chairman Mao in 1976 and the Fourth World Conference on Women {{organized}} by the UN Commission on the Status of Women held in Beijing in 1995, with China’s newly opened economic and cultural spaces allowing individuals the means to express themselves in ways not possible in the preceding fifteen years (at least), essentialized gender difference and heteronormative sexual practices once more came to the front of social awareness. In this new atmosphere of increased personal and economic freedom the “woman question” finds new life. In the same climate where young women find themselves confronted with stereotypes such as the “baigujing” career woman, and contemplating “eating the rice bowl of youth,” Chinese feminists such as Dai Jinhua and Li Xiaojiang have been and continue to promote <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds</b> of “corporeal feminism” as a means for women to counteract gender oppression and create <b>their</b> <b>own</b> individual identities.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} British fan magazines {{from the}} first half of the twentieth century, considering their early development and contribution to UK film culture. I focus on their wartime content and contexts in the late 1930 s and early 1940 s – a period that constituted ‘something of a “golden age”’ for British cinema, ‘both in terms of popularity and creativity’ (Taylor 1988 : 6). In looking at British magazines in volume across the war years, this chapter considers the shape and structure of the periodicals on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> terms, illuminating the ways in which such extra-textual materials generated <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds</b> of cinema culture, and mediated film for a UK readership. I thus offer a new interrogation of national specifically print cultures of cinema by focusing on wartime female stardom. To do so, I turn to a case study of the transatlantic star Vivien Leigh, who was born to English parents in India in 1913, raised in England, and made her name as a major star in Hollywood in the late 1930 s. I examine Leigh’s representation within the leading UK fan magazine of the period, Picturegoer and Film Weekly, considering its complex attempts to both establish and discredit her stardom specifically in relation to war...|$|R
25|$|Crocodiles {{are also}} the most vocal of all reptiles, {{producing}} {{a wide variety of}} sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. Depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone. Some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex; the common concern being reproduction. Therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round territorial behaviour in some species and quarrels during feeding. Crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.|$|E
25|$|Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> {{when food}} is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been {{observed}} carrying dead males in their fangs. This behavior may be triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson surmise that non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the “aggressive spillover hypothesis,” this tendency unselectively to attack anything that moves is cultivated by {{a positive correlation between}} hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression at a young age leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior “spills over” into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species.|$|E
25|$|The {{rights of}} {{livestock}} and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, {{even if they}} have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and their lives have passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.|$|E
6000|$|In North America, {{the large}} and {{handsome}} Danais archippus, with rich reddish-brown wings, is very common; and it is closely imitated by Limenitis misippus, a butterfly allied to our [...] "white admiral," [...] but which has acquired a colour quite distinct {{from that of the}} great bulk of its allies. In the same country there is a still more interesting case. The beautiful dark bronzy green butterfly, Papilio philenor, is inedible both in larva and perfect insect, and it is mimicked by the equally dark Limenitis ursula. There is also in the Southern and Western States a dark female form of the yellow Papilio turnus, which in all probability obtains protection from its general resemblance to P. philenor. Mr. W.H. Edwards has found, by extensive experiment, that both the dark and yellow females produce <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds,</b> with very few exceptions; and he thinks that the dark form has the advantage in the more open regions and in the prairies, where insectivorous birds abound. But in open country the dark form would be quite as conspicuous as the yellow form, if not more so, so that the resemblance to an inedible species would be there more needed.[103] ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on the popular 19th century melodramas about the case and is highly theatrical, with an opening in which all the {{characters}} are introduced by a Master of Ceremonies in front of a painted backdrop, but is also slightly more lavishly produced and cinematically inventive than the later films directed by Tod Slaughter's producer George King.
