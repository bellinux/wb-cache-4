At first, the performance goes well, {{but soon the}} Phantom's curse <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect,</b> backstage, causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror, descending, in a dream-like sequence, semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as Erik and declares his love; Christine faints, so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day, when she awakens, she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free {{to come and go}} as she pleases, but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room, the Phantom is playing his composition, [...] "Don Juan Triumphant." [...] Christine's curiosity gets the better of her, and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask, revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged, the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known.

40|$|Abstract: „The Way We Were” – A {{cultural}} sociological {{reading of}} {{the representation of the}} Jewish identity in the American feature films – From the beginning of the American movie history, there were lots of movies made, which had Jewish characters in leading roles. The Jewish characters in the movies of course not representing the Jews as they existed in the American society. The presentation of the characters in the movies based on the view of the makers, how they see the Jews, which based on how the society of different periods sees the Jews. Movies always wanted to represent the view of the society – mainly in the American movie industry, which wanted to reach financial success, so they wanted to fit the audience’s expectations, sometimes even change it. By watching the Jewish characters in the American movies, we won’t be able to find out the American Jewish identity as it was, but we can see how the moviemakers and the audience wanted to see them, actually what kind of identity they would like if the Jews had. The topic of the research is to examine the Jewish identity represented in the American feature films from the view of the sociology of culture. The hypotheses are: Before the II. World War the Jewish identity in the American films is a typical immigrant identity: has its bases in the European (Jewish) culture, but on the new land feels free to create oneself a totally new identity (based on the idea of the “American Dream”) Since the II. World War and the anti-Semitism was a European event, maybe the American Jews didn’t made such a fundamental element of their identity out of the Holocaust as the European Jews. After the II. World War the American movie makers must familiarize the American society with the Holocaust, that changes the Jewish characters in the movies. Almost 50 years after the II. World War the Jewish characters seems to be again something similar as they were before the Holocaust, but not immigrants anymore, but real American citizens, who are part of the American society. So at the beginning we see in the movies Jewish immigrants who don’t want to be Jewish (in a “European way”) anymore, but want to be Americans, although they don’t really know what does that mean. Later, as the anti-Semitism also <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect</b> in the USA, the Jewish characters seems to disappear from the movie screen. As the USA enters the II. World War – and against the Nazi side – and even later, when the truth about the concentration camps became uncovered, the Jewish characters appear again in the movies with a very strong Jewish identity. This phenomenon on the movie screen for the sixties leads some kind of “Jewish coming out”: (the artists themselves also, but we examine the movie characters) became proud Jews at the first place, and Americans only on the second place. Some more decades are needed to these Jews to turn back to their previous – {{at the beginning of the}} century – dream: about the nineties they really have the opportunity to became American and make real the “American Dream”, but not by leaving their Jewish identity, as they wanted, but making out a new kind of Jewish identity: an American Jewish identity. Of course we don’t know how it fits to the real American Jewish identity, we can just see as it happens in the movies. This kind of forming out a new kind of Jewish identity and as it can be seen in the American feature films, is unique phenomenon in the Jewish sociology of culture (although not unique phenomenon in the American movie history, since something similar happened to the Black Americans – at least on the movie screen. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Figures {{of speech}} in {{addition}} to their aesthetic functions have different effects on words. Internal music is one of the  effects of figures of speech  which can {{play an important role in}} beautifying the word and its effect on the audience. The internal music comes with the use of verbal figures of speech. Figures that make words related by similarity or uniformity of vowels and consonants and create sensible  alliteration. Categories of palilogy, alliteration, parallelism, pun and riming prose are among the figures of speech  that play a major role in creating internal  music of the poem. In this study, with a descriptive-analytical approach, we discuss the roll of music making factors in  Tamhidat as an example of prose poem. The language of Ein ol-Ghozat in Tamhidat is preachy and didactical and in an addressing mode. Despite the intensity and sharpness of his speech, he speaks simple language with his audience. However, his words are in some cases melodious that influences audience and increases its penetration in the listener. The music of his words is natural so the listener can feel it with his spirit and <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> <b>effect.</b> Well syntagmatic arrangement of words is one of his language features that is based on music and phonemes' melody. This music gives words importance and predominance and makes Tamhida's  prose a kind of prose poem. Applying some of the subtle and tiny musical elements such as parallelism (paronomasia /pun) makes the music of book more effective and catching. In other words, harmony of sounds and synchronization through which prose becomes rhythmic and melodious is one of the aesthetic aspects of the mystical prose of Ein ol-Ghozat that arises from his word's music and special intonation, so as human nature accepts it and enjoys reading. This word music is found in the form of alliteration, pun, repetition, and meter in important parts of his speech that sometimes becomes close to prosodic meter. In Ein ol-Ghozat's prose without feeling prosodic meter by listener, a wave of intonation and meter dominates resulted from alliteration and rhyme, and proximity of the number of syllables in every symmetry and perhaps likeness and nearness of the number of syllables in all or parts of the symmetries. Repetition as a key element of the internal music is one of Ein ol-Ghozat's stylistic characteristic.   Repetitions are seen in three forms in Ein ol-Ghozat languages. 1 - Alliteration, this group consists of various kinds of pun, rhyme, repetition, etc. 2 - Parallelism: Repetition of words or phrases. 3 - Palilology: Repetition of word: This form is one of the most important and aesthetic repetition in Tamhidat that {{in addition to}} making prose integrated, is effective in conveying the concept and content of the message of Ein ol-Ghozat, as repetition of the words "Alas," " O’ Friend," and "O’ Dear" in several phrases has a great influence in stimulation of feeling and  inculcation emotion in the reader. Alliteration: One of the most important aspects of aesthetics in the mystical prose of Ein ol-Ghozat are sound harmony and alliteration that can be mainly found in pun/ paronomasia and riming. Usage of rhyme in all Tamhidat is not in the same level. Wherever  discussion is didactic and reasoning, it is not generally riming, but where  the subject is stories and anecdotes and analogies or becomes emotional, usually is riming. One manifestation of this figure is short sentences and aphorisms, whether the word is quotation of  an old or an important person or whether the author expresses his own word. Apart from these, Ein ol-Ghozat has worked other ways to enrich his word's music. The most important of these methods are: 	Bringing words that at least their initials are co-voiced. Such as: "Ebtela" and "Emtehan" 	Phonemes processing: a kind of internal music is repetition and sameness of consonants and vowels. This figure in some cases, with creating a specific internal music, highlights the phrases and helps to conveying the message and gives pleasure to the audience. 	Bringing together words that make a pun is another species of alliteration in the language of Ein ol-Ghozat. This figure of speech is one of the best examples of  creating and enhancing music in words or sentences. 	Bringing together the co-meter terms is one of other species of alliteration in Tamhidat. 	 Repetition of words or phrases, are of those categories that is used in the mystical prose of Ein ol-Ghozat and is one of the stylistic features and music making elements of his Word. Repetition in Ein ol-Ghozat's language, sometimes have artistic and rhetorical aspects that helps his prose being rhythmic and is effective in conveying the meaning and intention of the speaker. Ein ol-Ghozat while repeats thoughts and beliefs of the mystics, repeats words and combinations in the various types, so that he not only raises the words' musical level and makes it melodious, but also increases the rhythmic role of his own speaking. Sometimes this repetition in the form of word or phrase in the end of sentence comes symmetrically, it functions like radif in hemistiches and if in the terms of syllables number be long, makes  an intonation in the words too...|$|E
