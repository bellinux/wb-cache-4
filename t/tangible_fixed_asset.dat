30|$|Our {{findings}} corroborate {{the proposed}} hypothesis. First, {{there is a}} positive and strong correlation between the ex-ante probability of default and the ratio of <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> (the assets that can be pledged as mortgage collateral) to financial debt in the case of Spanish micro firms, suggesting that firms with risky business models bias their capital structure towards mortgage loans to avoid filing for bankruptcy in the event of default. Second, a higher proportion of <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> over financial debt significantly decrease the probability of being in bankruptcy among Spanish micro firms in financial distress. By contrast, these two relations do not hold either for Spanish larger businesses or for firms from the other two countries.|$|R
