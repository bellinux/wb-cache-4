25|$|A puzzle is {{a problem}} or enigma that {{challenges}} ingenuity. Solutions <b>to</b> <b>puzzle</b> may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based {{on the process of}} inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik's Cube, invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.|$|E

25|$|Fitzgerald {{considered}} the novel {{to be his}} masterwork and expected it to eclipse the popularity and acclaim of his earlier novels, particularly The Great Gatsby.

Shaun Musgrave of Touch Arcade praised the game's graphics and combat, comparing the battle missions <b>to</b> <b>Puzzle</b> & Dragons.

500|$|A {{dish that}} succeeded <b>to</b> <b>puzzle</b> or {{surprise}} the diners {{was considered the}} greatest achievement of culinary sophistication. The [...] "secrets", divulged {{at the end of}} each chapter, provide examples of such recipes. One is for a capon in a bottle; the trick was to skin the bird, place the skin inside a bottle, fill it with a mixture of milk and eggs, and put the bottle into boiling water. As the mixture expanded in heat, it produced an illusion of a whole capon fit inside a bottle. Another [...] "secret" [...] is a recipe for an uncut pike with its head fried, its tail baked and its middle boiled; it was made by spit-roasting the fish while basting its head with oil or butter and sprinkling it with flour, and pouring salted vinegar on cloth wrapped around the middle part. The last recipe is for a broth boiled with a string of pearls and a golden coin, which was supposed to cure the sick and those [...] "despairing about their health".|$|E

500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer <b>to</b> <b>puzzle</b> our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
500|$|Gyromancer {{received}} a generally positive reception from reviewers. While many critics noted its similarity <b>to</b> <b>Puzzle</b> Quest, the gameplay was still {{described as being}} [...] "fun and addictive" [...] by Brett Todd of GameSpot, and similar praises were made by Daemon Hattfield of IGN and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. Welsh claimed {{that it had a}} great deal of replay value, and praised the [...] "surprisingly varied story missions". Game Informers Matt Miller disagreed slightly, stating that while the game had some replay value, it was limited by the lack of depth to the RPG elements of the game. Although the paintings of the monsters and game world were rated highly by critics, the art direction itself was criticized. Todd called the graphics [...] "murky and grainy" [...] and noted the lack of animation in the battles or cutscenes, in which two-dimensional pictures of the characters speaking [...] "slide back and forth like cardboard cutouts" [...] rather than perform realistic movements. Welsh added that the stage maps were [...] "crudely portrayed". Hattfield did not share those concerns, but did note say that they felt that the portraits of monsters were reused for different monsters too often. Miller disagreed completely with the other critics, saying that the game [...] "looks great" [...] and that [...] "even the map screen between battles has a polished appearance". A reviewer from GameTrailers also enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, saying that despite the [...] "still images" [...] and [...] "simple effects", the game made an [...] "effort to look and sound the part" [...] of a deeper game, which they felt would increase the player's enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|After the fiasco at the bar, Mulder and Scully meet. She sadly tells Mulder {{that she}} does not think he and Fletcher can be {{returned}} to their own bodies. However, soon after that, the warp caused by the alien craft begins to snap back and repair the natural order of the universe. Grodin, realizing that everything will be fixed naturally, gathers up Lana Chee and the pilot. Scully and Fletcher arrive at Fletcher’s home, and see Mulder standing by the moving truck. Joanne Fletcher berates Mulder about Scully but he insists that he and Fletcher have swapped bodies. Fletcher goes to help Joanne move a chair and confesses that Mulder is telling the truth. He tells her enough of their past to convince her he is Morris Fletcher. Jeff Smoodge and a group of troops appear at Fletcher's home and detain Mulder, Fletcher, Scully and the flight data recorder in their car. Grodin explains that he is restoring everything and that he reversed the body-swap between the pilot and the old Hopi woman. The warp passes over them and the past few days are rewritten. Mulder and Fletcher are restored to their own bodies and returned to the moment when Fletcher’s troops pulled them over on the highway. This time no ship passes overhead and Mulder and Scully leave uneventfully. After Mulder and Scully leave the highway near area 51, Scully calls from FBI headquarters to tell Mulder that they have escaped reprimand from Director Kersh for going to Nevada. Scully opens her desk drawer to place a file inside and finds the penny and dime that were fused together from the event at the gas station in her desk drawer indicating that while some things have reversed themselves, not everything has. [...] Mulder enters his apartment and finds that Morris Fletcher has completely reorganized and cleaned his apartment and both Mulder and Scully are left <b>to</b> <b>puzzle</b> over their recollection of events.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle <b>to</b> <b>puzzle</b> through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E
