5|$|Despite the {{continuing}} debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{has been the}} most influential president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication, dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising.

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E

5000|$|In 1991 Kelley {{published}} Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography. She {{was paid}} $3.5 million {{to write the}} book. The book claimed <b>that</b> Nancy <b>Reagan</b> had had affairs with Frank Sinatra, that she frequently relied on astrology, that she had lied about her age, {{and that she had}} a very poor relationship with her children, even alleging that she hit her daughter, Patti. According to Newsweek, [...] "Despite her wretched excesses, Kelley has the core of the story right. Even her staunchest defenders concede <b>that</b> Nancy <b>Reagan</b> is more Marie Antoinette than Mother Teresa.". However Newsweek also criticized the book's basic factual accuracy, noting that Kelley had reported <b>that</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> had allegedly date raped a 19-year-old, when the accuser would have actually been 25 at the time.|$|R
5|$|Paul {{held one}} of his {{numerous}} press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration {{to balance the budget}} and cut spending and taxes.

Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} before the shooting, Vice President George H. W. Bush {{received}} the assignment of running crisis management in case of emergency despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig's objection. When the White House learned of the assassination attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. The vice president was notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning that the president was wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at what its pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. <b>That</b> <b>Reagan</b> played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Reagan sealed up {{conservative}} support. Shell hesistated {{to support}} Reagan: he questioned Reagan's late conversion {{to the party}} {{and some of the}} leftist associations <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> maintained during the 1950s, when he had nevertheless supported Eisenhower for President. Reagan went on to secure the nomination by defeating former San Francisco Mayor George Christopher, a Greek American who had been Nixon's lieutenant governor running mate in 1962. Shell claimed <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> had earlier promised to support him for governor, an assertion <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> denied.

5000|$|Although {{he was a}} [...] "fusionist" [...] {{conservative}} who believed in both small-government and socially-conservative positions, Rusher was greatly concerned with unifying the movement and keeping it unified. He believed <b>that</b> Ronald W. <b>Reagan,</b> whom he promoted as a possible presidential candidate as early as 1967 and in whose reluctant campaign for the Republican nomination in 1968 he had some involvement, was the ideal leader for this purpose. Rusher also believed <b>that</b> the <b>Reagan</b> presidency was the conservatives' greatest political achievement.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout {{the world and into}} space. However, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that this feeling of helplessness, coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E
500|$|Opinions of Reagan's legacy {{among the}} country's leading {{policy makers and}} journalists differ as well. Edwin Feulner, {{president}} of The Heritage Foundation, said <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> [...] "helped create a safer, freer world" [...] and said of his economic policies: [...] "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny." [...] However, Mark Weisbrot, co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, contended that Reagan's [...] "economic policies were mostly a failure" [...] while Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post opined <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> was [...] "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest." ...|$|E
500|$|While President Ronald Reagan was a {{supporter}} of the Contra cause, the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7, 1985, indicate <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to [...] "moderate elements" [...] within that country. Weinberger wrote <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> said [...] "he could answer to charges of illegality but couldn't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages. After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986, Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages. The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials. On March 4, 1987, Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address, taking full responsibility, and saying that [...] "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages".|$|E

500|$|Tom Lehrer made {{a similar}} {{comparison}} in his song [...] "George Murphy," [...] which opens, [...] "Hollywood's often tried to mix show-business with politics, from Helen Gahagan to Ronald Reagan". Helen Gahagan was also an entertainer turned politician, progressing from Broadway to [...] U.S. Congress until Richard Nixon unseated her after claims that Gahagan was “pink down to her underwear”. [...] In Lehrer's song on his 1965 live album, he punctuates Reagan's name with a question mark, evoking a laugh from an audience who did not yet know <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> would sweep the gubernatorial election the following year.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Polish President Lech Kaczyński posthumously conferred on Reagan {{the highest}} Polish distinction, the Order of the White Eagle, saying <b>that</b> <b>Reagan</b> had {{inspired}} the Polish {{people to work}} for change and helped to unseat the repressive communist regime; Kaczyński said it [...] "would {{not have been possible}} if it was not for the tough-mindedness, determination, and feeling of mission of President Ronald Reagan."

500|$|Additionally, some {{media outlets}} were criticized for lionizing Reagan without paying equal {{attention}} to more controversial decisions made during his administration.
