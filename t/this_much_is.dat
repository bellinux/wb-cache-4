He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by the National Geographic Project.

As the second-most senior Justice on the Court (after Chief Justice Rehnquist), {{it is likely that}} Stevens' would have written the opinion himself had Rehnquist not elected to do so. <b>This</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> suggested by the length of Stevens' concurrence which runs several pages (official format) longer than Rehnquist's opinion.

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, <b>this</b> <b>much</b> <b>is</b> true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Especially {{important}} is Rachmaninoff's use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, {{most notably in}} the choral symphony The Bells, the Second Piano Concerto, the E flat major Étude-Tableaux (Op.33, [...] ), and the B-minor Prelude (Op.32, [...] ).
