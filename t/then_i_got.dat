5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E
500|$|The sprawling, {{progressive}} midsection was not {{featured in}} the song's original edit, but is based around a riff that Rudess came up with in the control room, when listening to the original, more conservative instrumental section. [...] "I was debating whether or not I should even bring it up, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> brave and said 'You know, I've got this weird idea.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The duo were {{disappointed}} with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, {{who felt that}} he sang poorly. Simon {{said that he did}} not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: [...] "I didn't get what had happened– how big it was– until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|During his monologue, host Rock joked, [...] "Clint Eastwood's a star, OK? Tobey Maguire's {{just a boy}} in tights," [...] He also added, [...] "You want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law? Wait. You want Russell Crowe and all you can get is Colin Farrell? Wait. Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew who I was. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> angry as his remarks became personal. My friends were livid. It's unfortunate I had five or six films come out at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bo Diddley {{modified}} the song's signature riff for his March 1955 song [...] "I'm a Man". He reworked it as a four-note figure, which is repeated {{for the entire}} song without a progression to other chords. [...] Music critic and writer Cub Koda calls it [...] "the most recognizable blues lick in the world". [...] Waters, not to be outdone, responded two months later with an answer song to [...] "I'm a Man", titled [...] "Mannish Boy". [...] "Bo Diddley, he was tracking me down with my beat when he made 'I'm a Man'. [...] That's from 'Hoochie Coochie Man.' [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on it with 'Mannish Boy' and just drove him out of my way", Waters recalled. [...] Emphasizing the origin of Bo Diddley's song, Waters sticks to the original first eight-bar phrase from [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] and includes some of the hoodoo references.|$|E

5000|$|He {{also spoke}} about the {{deadline}} for the release date, saying: [...] "You know what’s the trip about it? At the end, I was trying to reach deadline, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> said fuck that, we coming out December 10. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> stressed out after things was done. Ain’t that a trip? Neck got tight and shit. I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my release date. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my album done and all the covers.

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Tony Mark, the blood, {{sweat and}} heat captured on-camera {{in the production}} was mirrored behind the scenes. [...] "It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject", Mark said in an interview, [...] "There was a palpable tension throughout on the set. It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other, but {{when the time comes}} to do the work, they come together to get the job done." [...] Renner remembered, [...] "I got food bugs. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> food poisoning: lost 15lbs in three days". In addition to the burden of the heat, the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed [...] In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, [...] "people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating". A week later, filming resumed.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer. On remakes, {{director}} Bayona noted that [...] "The Americans have {{all the money in}} the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money" [...] and [...] "The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|Guest {{stars on}} the episode {{included}} Matt Winston, who appeared {{for the fourth time}} as Temporal Agent Daniels, having previously played the role most recently in the second episode of [...] "". Returning to Star Trek, but appearing {{for the first time in}} Enterprise, was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "", as well as the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else {{is he going to do}} after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E

500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons.

Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{served as}} an awakening for Garcia, who later commented: [...] "That's where my life began. Before then I was always living at less than capacity. I was idling. That was the slingshot {{for the rest of}} my life. It was like a second chance. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> serious". It was at this time that Garcia began to realize that he needed to begin playing the guitar in earnest—a move which meant giving up his love of drawing and painting.|$|E

2500|$|Garðar {{spent six}} months at a Hertfordshire private school in England when he was aged nine and 11. He insists that {{there was never any}} {{pressure}} on him to become a singer.

I'd listen to dad's records of other tenors and whole operas but I also had a huge pile of Bon Jovi, Queen and Shakin' Stevens albums. I absolutely loved Prince and when I was 10 I was convinced I wanted to be a pop star. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> bitten by the acting bug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Connolly's The Big Yin {{nickname}} {{was first}} used during his adolescent years to differentiate between himself and his father. [...] "My father {{was a very strong}} man.

And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> bigger than him, and the whole thing got out of control. And then I became The Big Yin in Scotland. So, we'd go into the pub and someone would say, 'Billy Connolly was in.' 'Oh? Big Billy or Wee Billy?' 'The Big Yin.' 'Oh, Wee Billy.' If you were a stranger, you'd think, 'What are these people talking about?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{explained}} his stage name {{in an interview}} with ThisIsRnB: [...] "Earl St.Clair came from the irony from the fact that where I started producing in Cleveland, the street I was working on was St. Clair.
