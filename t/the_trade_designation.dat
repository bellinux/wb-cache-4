It divides defence against it into two different means [...] dispute proceedings by the Industrial Property Office and judicial instruments. Chapter Three concentrates on comments on the ineligibility for enrolment of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> mark <b>designation</b> and reasons for taking these comments.

50|$|Cultigens may {{be named}} {{in any of}} a number of ways. The {{traditional}} method of scientific naming is under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and many of the most important cultigens, like maize (Zea mays) and banana (Musa acuminata), are so named. Although it is perfectly in order to give a cultigen a botanical name, in any rank desired, now or at any other time, these days it is more common for cultigens to be given names in accordance with the principles, rules and recommendations laid down in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) which provides for the names of cultigens in three classification categories, the cultivar, the Group (formerly cultivar-group), and the grex. From that viewpoint it may be said that there is a separate discipline of cultivated plant taxonomy, which forms one of the ways to look at cultigens.

5000|$|The Scots traders {{development}} of {{a different way of}} carrying out <b>the</b> Indian <b>trade</b> was a major factor in its expansion. They formed trading companies with minor traders working on behalf of the company, instead of the practice of sole traders working on their own. As [...] "for the more effectual carrying on <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> and supplying <b>the</b> Indians, we thought it proper to join in one company", this was to cut back on competition which would drive down profits, to reduce risk for each trader and also to combine the various, often complementary, skills and experience of the individual traders. It allowed them to keep several traders stationed at any one time in the Indian country to smooth out any difficulties which might emerge with the Indians. The best and most successful example of this is the company of the [...] "Gentlemen of Augusta" [...] or Brown, Rae and Company, which by 1755 had gained three-quarters of the Creek and Chickasaw <b>trade.</b> <b>The</b> Gentlemen of Augusta also avoided obvious and institutionalised exploitation of the Indians. This is shown by the company's establishment of set prices, the abandonment of Rum as a <b>trading</b> tool, <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> of certain Indian villages as exclusive bases for <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> and other beneficial practices. These practices were soon adopted by other traders and <b>trading</b> companies throughout <b>the</b> Georgia and Carolina Indian country, especially after the Yamasee War. This cut down on the worst abuses of <b>the</b> Indian <b>trade</b> and removed much friction between Indians, traders and colonial authorities, at least until <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> was reorganised {{in the wake of the}} Seven Years' War.
