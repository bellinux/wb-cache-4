I had been playing guitar for a year (after the Beatles changed our lives), and they had NO use for a guitar player." [...] He then played keyboards and drums, and then taught himself {{how to play the}} guitar starting at age seven, when his father bought him a Kay acoustic guitar and a copy of the Beatles album Meet the Beatles. Lukather has said that the album [...] "changed his life" [...] and that he was greatly influenced by the guitar playing of George Harrison in particular.|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> go for the other... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition. Perhaps it was the red [...] background <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think of entrails, of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish. [...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E

Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take your pick) killer-seeking-revenge stories we all told as kids, and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (the whole story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> bust a gut." ...|$|E

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day.

Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, {{it would have been}} Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E

500|$|Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's {{production}} of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa {{as the basis for}} Neverminds songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1993 that he [...] "heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody." [...] Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as [...] "the one <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." [...] Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa [...] "blew my mind," [...] and that she [...] "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." [...] Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B on an A+ to F scale, writing that the [...] "episode didn’t really take {{advantage}} of Jack Burton's return to the show. Instead, it pushed him off to the sidelines {{to make room for}} a storyline that had no earthly business in this episode." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think, 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.'

500|$|His {{contract}} was terminated {{by mutual consent}} with a year to run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day. On joining Wycombe, Mousinho said [...] "It's been my local club since I was quite young so I've been down here {{a few times and}} it was the lure of that, plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor, <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> jump at the chance". He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1–1 draw against Morecambe, and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2–0 away victory over Chester City. Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010. Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe's 3–3 draw against his former employers, Brentford, netting in the first–half of the game with a volley. Two weeks later, he provided the assist for John Akinde's goal in the club's 1–1 draw with Barnet. He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place. The following season, he played a further 41 games for the club, scoring once in a 5–2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, but Wycombe were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. During his two years at Wycombe, he played a total of 79 times for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

In {{response}} to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: [...] "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." [...] Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: [...] "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," [...] whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: [...] "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever." [...] and added, [...] "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote [...] "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." [...] regarding the 8th season.|$|E
500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing and <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E

[...] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The Pixar magic continues with Brad Bird's Ratatouille, a gorgeous, wonderfully inventive computer-animated comedy." [...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Fresh family fun. Although there are those slightly noxious images of rodents scampering around a kitchen, the movie doesn't stoop to kid-pandering jokes based on back talk and bodily gases." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I'll be done: it's yummy." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Ratatouille never overwhelms, even though it's stocked with action, romance, historical content, family drama and serious statements about the creation of art." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "From the moment Remy enters, crashing, to the final happy fadeout, Ratatouille parades the brio and depth that set Pixar apart from and above other animation studios." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> positively desire one." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Had Bird gone the safe route, he would have robbed us of a great new cartoon figure in Remy, who {{like the rest of the}} film is rendered with animation that is at once fanciful and life-like.
