This paper reports {{the outcomes of}} an effect of sound created by rain fall on un-insulated metal <b>deck</b> <b>roofs</b> towards people's activities. The measurement and questionnaire distribution was done at selected UiTM buildings that have been built using un-insulated metal <b>deck</b> <b>roofs.</b> It {{was found that the}} occupants facing inconveniences condition that can disturb their activities. The comfort noise level that accepted by the human being is between 55 to 60 dB. Therefore, this study substantiates the notion that rain noise can contribute to negative effects in people's lives during rain...|$|R

5000|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well.

The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> improvements and camshaft gear train changes. The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements. The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes.|$|R
