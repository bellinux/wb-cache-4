50|$|In {{addition}} to offering unparalleled deskside performance for its day, the Cray CX1 also pioneered {{a number of}} unique technologies to make possible the integration of supercomputing into the traditional office space. In order to meet workplace noise requirements, the CX1 utilized an active noise cancellation system built into its cooling apparatus to quiet the sounds generated by the chassis's two large fans. Rather than requiring the deployment of separate Ethernet and/or Infiniband networks, the CX1 integrated network switches for both into the chassis to facilitate these high-speed interconnect protocols required by clustered simulations and applications. Additionally, unlike traditional servers and supercomputers that make use of higher 220V power, the CX1's redundant power supplies were designed to support traditional office power (120VAC, 20A). Finally, {{one of the most}} striking and recognizable features of the CX1 is the integrated <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>control</b> panel on the front face of the machine from which users could not only control each of the blades, but instantly gauge power consumption, core temperature, and fan speeds for the entire chassis.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fifth floor}} houses the Executive Education Center. The Executive Center {{includes}} five main areas: a dining room, a board room, a meeting room, a large reception area, and an auditorium {{on the second}} floor. The center provides a businesslike environment for the university to host an expanded offering of continuing education programs, particularly {{in the areas of}} professional development and training in the use of new technologies. The Executive Education Center provides technologically advanced conference space for the university, and businesses and organizations throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. In 2005, it was named the Joseph M. McShane, S.J., Executive Center to commemorate not only Father McShane’s tenure as president of the University of Scranton from 1998 until 2003 but also his vision and drive to create a home for the Kania School of Management that “would serve as common ground for the university and the broader community.” The Pearn Auditorium, which seats 140, serves as a gathering space for various lectures, presentations and community events. The 148-seat auditorium is equipped with the latest technology, including a network connection at every seat. The auditorium features Dolby surround sound, theater-style seating, a portable lectern with a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>control</b> system and teleconference capabilities. Dedicated in 2008, the James F. Pearn Auditorium {{on the second floor of}} Brennan Hall is named for the late father of Frank Pearn ‘83, the chief administrative officer of the Mergers and Acquisitions Division of Lehman Brothers, the chair of the university's Economic Strength Committee of the board of trustees, and a member of the Campaign Executive Committee. Dedicated in 2008, the Rose Room, located on the fifth floor of Brennan Hall, is used for lectures, dinners, luncheons, seminars, and other campus events. It can accommodate more than 200 people. It honors Harry Rose '65, the president and chief executive officer of The Rose Group, a restaurant management company, a member of the university's board of trustees, and a member of the Campaign Executive Committee. The Executive Center also contains a 50-seat board room which is used by various governing boards of the university, including the board of trustees, University Council and University Senate. In 2003, the University of Scranton named the board room in honor of PNC Bank to recognize a significant grant from the PNC Foundation for the construction of Brennan Hall and to acknowledge the support PNC has consistently provided to the university, as [...] "PNC Bank has been a loyal friend of the University of Scranton and a generous supporter of our educational mission and commitment to serve those living in northeast Pennsylvania.” Additional facilities of the Executive Center, which is available to organizations outside the university, include a lobby and reception area, and a meeting room accommodating 20 people.|$|E

40|$|A self contained, mobile {{drilling}} and coring system {{was designed to}} operate on the Lunar surface and be controlled remotely from earth. The system uses SKITTER (Spatial Kinematic Inertial Translatory Tripod Extremity Robot) as its foundation and produces Lunar core samples two meters long and fifty millimeters in diameter. The drill bit used for this is composed of 30 per carat diamonds in a sintered tungsten carbide matrix. To drill up to 50 m depths, the bit assembly will be attached to a drill string made from 2 m rods which will be carried in racks on SKITTER. Rotary power for drilling will be supplied by a Curvo-Synchronous motor. SKITTER is to support this system through a hexagonal shaped structure which will contain the drill motor and the power supply. A micro-coring drill {{will be used to}} remove a preliminary sample 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm long {{from the side of the}} core. This whole system is to be controlled from earth.

40|$|In many cockpits, control {{display units}} (CDUs) are vital input and {{information}} devices. In {{order to improve}} the usability of these devices, Barco, in cooperation with TU-Delft, created a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>control</b> unit (TSCU), consisting of a high-quality multi-touch screen. The unit fits in the standard dimensions of a conventional CDU and is thus suitable for both retrofit and new installations. The TSCU offers two major advantages. First, the interface can be reconfigured to enable consecutive execution of several tasks on the same display area, allowing for a more efficient usage of the limited display real-estate {{as well as a}} potential reduction of cost. Secondly, advanced graphical interface design, in combination with multi-touch gestures, can improve human-machine interaction. To demonstrate the capabilities of this concept, a graphical software application was developed to perform the same operations as a conventional CDU, but now using a direct manipulation interface (DMI) of the displayed graphics. The TSCU can still be used in a legacy CDU mode, displaying a virtual keyboard operated with the touch interface. In addition, the TSCU could be used for a variety of other cockpit functions. The paper concludes with a report of pilot and non-pilot feedback. Control and OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
