5|$|The {{service was}} officially opened on 23 March 1889, with <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer Gordon. Two {{days before the}} first service, the Metropolitan Board of Works was {{replaced}} by the London County Council (LCC), and the opening ceremony was conducted by Lord Rosebery instead of the expected Bazalgette. The sister vessel, Duncan was introduced on 20 April.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to <b>the</b> <b>paddle,</b> while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at either end, and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
50|$|In {{a simple}} <b>paddle</b> wheel, where <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> are fixed around the periphery, power is lost due to {{churning}} {{of the water}} as <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> enter and leave the water surface. Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> should remain vertical while under water. This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric. The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre. It is coupled to each paddle via a rod and lever. The geometry is designed such that <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> are kept almost vertical for the short duration {{that they are in}} the water.|$|R
50|$|Mode A is the {{original}} iambic mode, in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed. When <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> are released, <b>the</b> keying stops with the last dot or dash that was sent while <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> were depressed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>paddling</b> {{was against}} <b>the</b> school's own policy as <b>the</b> <b>paddling</b> was {{supposed}} to be done by someone of the same sex. In 2012 the policy was changed; parents have to opt into corporal punishment and they may choose which gender administrator may deliver it. The new policy allows female administrators to spank male students.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} various other shipwrecks in the vicinity. In 1889 <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer Mountaineer {{lived up to}} its name by clambering onto Lady's Rock, the damage to which was still visible in 1995. In 1905 the MacBrayne {{steamship}} Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives. The trawler MFV Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Weston-super-Mare is {{a tourist}} destination, with its long sandy beach, Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare Museum, Grand Pier, SeaQuarium {{aquarium}} and seasonal Wheel of Weston. A 2009 survey by Visit England placed the Grand Pier {{in the top}} ten free attractions in England. However, as of 2014, the pier charges for admission. On the Beach Lawns was a miniature railway operated by steam and diesel locomotives, which closed in 2012. <b>The</b> <b>Paddle</b> Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} in the local area of occupation since the Iron Age, {{it was still a}} small village until the 19th century when it became a seaside resort, and was connected with local towns and cities by a railway, and two piers were built. The growth continued until {{the second half of the}} 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare Museum, Grand Pier and an aquarium. <b>The</b> <b>Paddle</b> Steamer Waverley and MV Balmoral offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary.

2500|$|To help boats leave (downstream) a lock, the locksman would {{sometimes}} open <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> {{to create a}} swell, which would help [...] "flush" [...] the boat out of the lock. In one case, a boatsman asked for a back swell, that is, open and shut <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> {{a few times to}} create some waves, to help him get off the bank where he was stuck. If boats ran aground (from being overloaded) they sometimes asked passing crews to tell the upstream lock to give them an extra heavy swell, which consisted of opening all <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> on <b>the</b> lock gate, creating a surge that affected the whole pound below.|$|R
5|$|Burt was {{generous in}} life and honored after death. His {{charitable}} giving to Saginaw during his lifetime was extensive, including funding the City Auditorium, the Burt Manual Training School, a women’s hospital, a Salvation Army and a YWCA that later became Jacobson’s. The town of Burt, Michigan is named for him, as is Burt Street in Saginaw, which borders the same block as his former home. The Burt Opera House in Taymouth Township carries his name and is still in use today as a community center. Trips on <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer Wellington R. Burt were once a popular day excursion along the Saginaw River (1876–1891). Burt {{was inducted into the}} Saginaw Hall of Fame in 1967.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} ready for action and the ice had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes <b>the</b> <b>paddle.</b> The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by the {{observed}} coordination of nearby beating cilia, {{we use a}} scale model experiment to show that hydrodynamic interactions can cause synchronization between rotating paddles driven at constant torque in a very viscous fluid. Synchronization is only observed when the shafts supporting <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> have some flexibility. The phase difference in the synchronized state depends on the symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>paddles.</b> We use <b>the</b> method of regularized stokeslets to model <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> and find excellent agreement with the experimental observations. We also use a simple analytic theory based on far-field approximations to derive scaling laws for the synchronization time {{as a function of}} paddle separation. Comment: 23 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>paddles</b> {{and balls}} {{to be used}} also depend on the variety {{previously}} agreed upon {{for the development of}} the match or tournament. In the classic variations of pingpongo <b>the</b> traditional <b>paddles</b> and ball of ping pong are used.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} voices ceased, but <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> worked as furiously as before. Then the bush {{in front of}} Almayer shook, and the sharp sound of <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> falling into <b>the</b> canoe rang in the quiet night. They were {{holding on to the}} bush now; but Almayer could hardly make out an indistinct dark shape of a man's head and {{shoulders}} above the bank.|$|R
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|Scott Chambliss {{was hired}} as the {{production}} designer based on his work on Star Trek, produced by Orci and Kurtzman. The visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), represented by Roger Guyett and Eddie Pasquarello as visual effects supervisors. Under the supervision of Shane Mahan, Legacy Effects created practical puppet aliens and full scale alien speeders. New Deal Studios constructed a miniature of <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer that is seen upturned in the film. Kerner Optical built a miniature of the alien ship and bluescreen stand-ins. The film also featured visual effects by Fuel VFX, The Embassy, Ghost, and Shade VFX, with previsualization from Halon Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} rail {{passengers}} crossing to South Wales, {{which had been}} envisaged, was reduced after {{the opening of the}} Severn Tunnel in 1886. The tunnel linked South Gloucestershire in the west of England to Monmouthshire in south Wales, under the estuary of the River Severn. <b>The</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer Waverley first visited the pier to take on passengers in 1886, and along with sister ships of the White Funnel Fleet belonging to P and A Campbell provided excursions around the Bristol Channel. Other ships of the fleet including Ravenswood, Westward Ho, Cambria and Britannia regularly called at Clevedon. Other companies, including the Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson & Co., eventually taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier.|$|E
50|$|Mode B is {{the second}} mode, which devolved from a logic error in an early iambic keyer. In mode B, dots and dashes are {{produced}} as long as both paddles are depressed. When <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> are released, <b>the</b> keying continues by sending one more element, i.e., a dot if <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> were released during a dash, or a dash if <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> were released during a dot. Users accustomed to one mode usually {{find it difficult to}} use the other, so all competently designed keyers allow for selection of the desired keyer mode. If forced to use a keyer with an unaccustomed mode, the user must revert to single paddle mode in which both paddles are never depressed simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|In England the [...] "gate" [...] {{was similar}} to a {{temporary}} needle dam: a set of boards, called <b>paddles,</b> supported against <b>the</b> current by upright timbers called rymers which normally kept the level of water above it to navigable levels. Boats moving downstream would wait above the lock until <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> were removed, which would allow a [...] "flash" [...] of water to pass through, carrying the boats with it. Upstream boats would be winched or towed through the lock with <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> removed. Considerable skill was involved both in removing <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> {{in a timely manner}} and navigating the boat through the lock. Flash locks of this type have been documented since at least 1295 C.E.|$|R

5|$|Until the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead {{were served}} by <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamers of P and A Campbell who ran regular {{services}} to Barry and Cardiff {{as well as}} Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods, {{one of the reasons}} for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The pier at Burnham-on-Sea is the shortest pier in the UK. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. <b>The</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a {{new program}} for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the {{addition}} of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms or Trunks and Arms; LTA – Legs, Trunks, and Arms; and TA – Trunks and Arms, or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009.

40|$|Objective: <b>The</b> skin <b>paddle</b> of <b>the</b> free fibula flap {{receives}} its vascular supply from septocutaneous perforators, musculocutaneous perforators or from both, {{and these}} perforators might originate from the peroneal or posterior tibial vessels or from both. The {{objective of this}} study was to classify <b>the</b> skin <b>paddles</b> based on <b>the</b> dominance of vascular contribution by these axial vessels through their different perforator systems. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 5 -year data of 386 free fibula flaps used in oro-mandibular reconstruction was done and <b>the</b> skin <b>paddle</b> vascularity was studied. While majority of <b>the</b> skin <b>paddles</b> received their blood supply from the peroneal septocutaneous perforators, a few had their dominant supply from the soleus musculocutaneous perforators in addition to peroneal septocutaneous perforators. In few cases, the soleus musculocutaneous perforators were the sole source of blood supply to <b>the</b> skin <b>paddle.</b> <b>The</b> limitation in this study was the inability to augment the clinical observation with cadaveric study. Results: <b>The</b> skin <b>paddle</b> of <b>the</b> free fibula flap was classified into four different types (a-d) based on the dominance of vascular contribution by axial vessels of the leg. Conclusion: <b>The</b> skin <b>paddle</b> of <b>the</b> free fibula flap has reliable blood supply, but a thorough knowledge of the variations in vascular pattern of <b>the</b> skin <b>paddle</b> is required especially to salvage <b>the</b> larger <b>paddles</b> used in <b>the</b> reconstruction complex oro-mandibular defects...|$|R
50|$|Water is fed to the Steffturbine {{through an}} inlet channel. The {{inflow of water}} loads <b>the</b> <b>paddles.</b> <b>The</b> power thus exerted onto <b>the</b> <b>paddles</b> causes <b>the</b> chain, which is mounted to run on roller bearings, to move. In turn, the {{circulating}} chain imparts a rotational motion to the drive wheels. A generator {{is connected to the}} rotating drive wheels via an overdrive transmission. The generator converts the rotational mechanical power into an electrical output. The resultant electrical power is modulated by means of the electronic control system and adapted to the different operating modes.|$|R
5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is pointing. The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|The keel for Lussin {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} at San Rocco in September 1882. She {{was scheduled to be}} launched on 13 September 1883, but delays in the completion of her hull pushed her launching to 22 December. Completion of the ship was delayed further by a strike of the workers at the STT shipyard; {{this was the first time}} a strike had delayed the construction of a vessel for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After her engines and boilers were installed, she was towed to Pola on 12 July 1884 by <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> steamer Triton. In early October, she began sea trials, and on 21 February 1885, she completed her speed tests. She was commissioned for service the following day, and from 27 March to 30 April embarked on a cruise in the southern Adriatic Sea before operating with the main Austro-Hungarian ironclad squadron until it was disbanded for the year on 17 July.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} paddles {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed hit of <b>the</b> <b>paddle</b> gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E
