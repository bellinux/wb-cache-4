50|$|A geared head takes a pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>head</b> {{and adds}} gears {{to each of}} the axes.

40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic axis error following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic axis error was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic axis error was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of tilt angle compensation by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and the induced astigmatic axis error (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic axis error values at right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction.

Grey-level normalized face imagettes serve as input for linear auto-associative memory. One memory is computed for each pose using a Widrow-Hoff learning rule. Head pose is classified with a winner-takes-all process. We compare results from our method with abilities of human subjects to estimate head pose from the same data set.

40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The <b>tilt</b> of the <b>head</b> cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R
50|$|If in- stead of {{the actual}} <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (as {{compared}} to true vertical), {{the direction of the}} <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> as interpreted by the brain (subjective <b>head</b> <b>tilt)</b> is given importance, then it is seen that the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and ocular torsion are actually in the same direction in both the physiologic ocular counter-roll and the pathologic ocular tilt reaction. The subjective <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> as interpreted by the brain in the presence of asymmetric signals from the inner ear neural afferents is the principal factor in determining the direction of ocular torsion in ocular tilt reaction.|$|R
40|$|Assuming {{that type}} I atrial flutter is a macroreentrant circuit, its cycle length should {{vary with the}} atrial dimensions. In order to test this hypothesis, flutter cycle length was {{measured}} while inducing atrial volume and pressure changes by postural and pharmacological means in seven patients undergoing a therapeutic programmed stimulation for type I atrial flutter conversion. Right atrial volume was estimated from B-mode echocardiography data. Basal values were compared with those obtained during inspiration, expiration, Valsalva maneuver, negative <b>tilt</b> (<b>head</b> down), and positive <b>tilt</b> (<b>head</b> up) with 0. 8 - 1. 6 mg p. o. nitroglycerin. The right atrial size increased slightly from 17. 8 to 18. 3 cm 2 (P = 0. 04) during the pressure load induced by negative tilt (+ 3 mmHg), with a corresponding lengthening of the flutter cycle length from 228 to 233 msec (P = 0. 02). Similarly, pressure unloading of - 2 mmHg by positive tilting and nitrates {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in right atrial size to 16. 6 cm 2 (P = 0. 04), with a corresponding decrease in cycle length from 228 to 219 msec (P = 0. 03). Respiratory maneuver yielded similar results with an inspiratory cycle lengthening, expiratory shortening, and further shortening during Valsalva maneuver. These experiments demonstrate a direct relation between cycle length and atrial volume in human type I atrial flutter. They underline the importance of the right heart preload and atrial size for the electrophysiological characteristics of type I atrial flutter. Beside its fundamental interest, this finding is important for the understanding of the mechanism of maintenance and therapeutic responses of this common arrhythmia...|$|E

40|$|Background: Liver {{resection}} {{surgery is}} a potentially curative treatment for liver tumours. The liver {{is a highly}} vascular organ, and substantial intra-operative blood loss is common. Increased blood loss negatively impacts both postoperative outcome and long-term survival. A low central venous pressure (CVP) has been suggested {{in order to reduce}} blood loss during liver surgery. The rationale is that low CVP reflects lower pressure in the hepatic venous system, which in turn reduces the driving force causing bleeding when the liver tissues are transected. Together with fluid restriction, strategies to achieve a low CVP (LCVP) include patient <b>tilt</b> (<b>head</b> up or down), zero PEEP, nitroglycerine, diuretics and neuraxial anaesthesia. Vasopressin reduces portal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and has been shown to reduce blood loss in liver transplantation. LCVP management in liver surgery is associated with reduced blood loss and may increase the risk of organ of hypo-perfusion. Aims: To investigate the effect of patient position (tilt), nitroglycerine, PEEP and vasopressin on portal and hepatic venous pressures and systemic haemodynamics. To assess the effect of vasopressin on portal and hepato-splanchnic blood flows. To determine whether pressure changes in the superior vena cava are reflected in the hepatic venous system. To retrospectively evaluate the effects of a new anaesthetic management protocol involving low CVP and goal directed therapy (GDT/LCVP) in liver resection surgery. Methods: We used tip-manometer catheters to directly measure changes in hepatic venous and portal pressures during 10 ° <b>tilt</b> (<b>head</b> up and down), nitroglycerine infusion, and alterations in PEEP. The effect of low-to-moderate doses of vasopressin on hepatic venous and portal flow and pressure was assessed with conventional fluid-filled catheters in these vessels, collection of samples for blood gas analysis and the application of Fick’s principle. The effects on systemic haemodynamics were also assessed. Patient data were obtained and compared from two cohorts, before and after the introduction of GDT/LCVP. Results: Patient tilt led to substantial changes in CVP and mean arterial pressure (MAP), but only minor effects on hepatic pressures. Increased PEEP resulted in small increases in hepatic and central venous pressures. Nitroglycerine caused a parallel decrease in systemic and hepatic venous pressures. Cardiac output decreased. With the addition of head down tilt, MAP, cardiac output and CVP increased. Hepatic venous pressure increased marginally, but did not return to baseline. Vasopressin had no effect on hepatic pressures, but led to decreases in portal and hepato-splanchnic blood flow. After the introduction of LCVP/GDT management, median intra-operative haemorrhage decreased by almost a litre, with no increase in post-operative complications. Conclusions: Changes in CVP reflect changes in hepatic venous pressure in the supine position, but not during patient tilt. Tilting is not effective in reducing hepatic venous pressures. Nitroglycerine reduces the hepatic and portal venous pressures, but adverse central hemodynamic effects may limit its application. Vasopressin reduces portal and hepatic blood flow with only minor effect on pressures. Introducing goal-directed therapy with a low CVP protocol led to a large reduction in intra-operative blood loss compared to previous anaesthetic management techniques.

40|$|Heliostats {{of central}} {{receiver}} {{solar power plants}} reach dimensions up to 150 m 2 with focal lengths up to 1000 m. Their optical properties and tracking accuracy have great influence on the power plant efficiency {{and need to be}} monitored both at plant start up and during operation. Up to now, there are few efficient and fast measurement techniques that allow the heliostat properties to be measured. Flux density measurements and close-range photogrammetry are possible approaches, yet they do not fulfill the requirement to be accurate, inexpensive and fast at the same time. In this paper, we present a non-contact measurement principle, which uses edge detection to extract the heliostat and facet vertices. This information is used to calculate the surface normals. Furthermore, the corners can replace retroreflective targets generally used in close-range photogrammetry, thus enabling a fast and completely automatic evaluation of the three-dimensional heliostat structure. The pictures are provided by a digital camera which is mounted on a pan <b>tilt</b> <b>head</b> on top of the central receiver tower, offering visibility to all heliostats and allowing the automated qualification of whole heliostat fields {{in a short period of}} time. It is shown that measurement uncertainties in heliostat orientation for the investigated heliostat are below 4 mrad in 80 % of the relevant heliostat positions. Heliostat orientation is available within three minutes. Photogrammetric measurements based on edge detection at a 40 -m 2 CESA- 1 heliostat at the Plataforma Solar de Almerìa (PSA) exhibit an accuracy of 1. 6 mrad for a single-facet normal vector with the results being available within 30 minutes. The reduced measurement time allows the economic characterization of entire heliostat fields. The lower accuracy compared to manual photogrammetry with retroreflective targets is still sufficient to detect facet misalignments in existing heliostat fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{project is}} based on the {{possibilities}} of a form of ‘table-top’ video sculpture, part architectural model, part video installation. Four of these ‘table-top’ pieces are be arranged in a darkened gallery, each simultaneously projecting perfectly synchronised, choreographed video sequences of the interior of four related architectural spaces. Each location has been shot using a repertoire of specific camera ‘moves’. These movements were devised in strict relation to the particularity of the spaces and their features and are physically subject to the building itself. For this we had custom built two camera mounts - a three axis 360 -degree pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>head</b> and a dolly or 'sled' to use balustrades or handrails as guides for tracking. With these devices the building were be literally used as the armature for a mobile camera. We were interested in architectural locations that are stylistically related, with strong linear organisation yet with distinctly different functions. We identified the work of Erich Mendelsohn and in particular the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill on Sea, the Schocken Department store building in Chemnitz, The Metal Workers' Union (IGM) Building in Berlin and the B'nai Amoona Synagogue in St. Louis, USA, (now the Centre of Contemporary Arts). Each of these 'signature' buildings offers the potential for treatment - curving stairways, projecting mezzanine floors etc. as well as being of significance beyond, in terms of architectural modernism, European design and European history. In addition to the three European buildings, the B'nai Amoona Synagogue, while not completing the story, more fully plots Mendlesohn's career; his origins in the East, his work in West Germany, his flight to England, and eventual residence in America. Obviously this is a story which is not untypical of that generation and that historical moment. Its significance is considerable in terms of the European influence on American art and design and the shift of a perceived centre, away from Europe, through the work of other celebrated German émigré architects such as Mies Van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. The video footage has been edited ‘across’ the three screens of each of the four table top ‘models’ to produce a fluid space in which the architecture of the building, and the experience of it, are re-drawn through the synchronised, continuous movement of three points of view, in, and across the four sites simultaneously. The work aims to construct an analogy between the serpentine fluidity of Mendelsohn's buildings, as canonical modernist architecture, the complex significance of the buildings and the ‘motion-path’ of a camera as it glides through this space. Formally, Motion Path engages with {{the problem of how to}} film a building - the relationship between cinematic poetics, that is; how to approach a building cinematically, and documentary; how to fuse the factual documentary film or the industrial film with abstract cinema? Initially we were interested in using work we had developed based on the idea of a virtual camera in a 3 D computer-modelling programme. We wanted to attempt to move a camera through a real building as if it were in a digital 'fly through'. Here a number of connections can be made. Firstly; the history of architectural film and the use of film to introduce the public to modernist architecture; the idea of architectural film speaking directly to the public and generating an experience of modernist architecture that remained true to the characteristics of the building, and was perhaps even superior to the direct experience of that building (the space in it’s idealised form). Examples here would be the films of Pierre Chenal, Man Ray and Hans Richter that emphasise the dynamics of modernist architecture. Their emphasis is on movement and circulation in order to experience the building as a set of changing relationships between vistas, voids, solids and apertures. Secondly there is much academic and historical writing on the links between architecture and film, and in particular the connection between the moving, restless camera in early architectural film and the distracted gaze of the spectator of architectural modernism. Here film is seen as the ideal medium for rendering the dynamism of modern architecture and the connection between the roving camera and the mobile spectator as detailed in Beatriz Colomina's work on Le Corb and the architectural promenade are important. A final example of the context to the work to note is the recent publication in England of 'Zoomscapes; Architecture in Motion and Media' by Mitchell Schwarzer (Princeton) which presents many very interesting and closely related ideas - specifically the ways in which architecture is not solely experienced through the direct encounter with a built space but equally (if not predominantly) from the car, train or plane and through its representation in film, TV and photography. On Mendelsohn's 'America: An Architect's Picturebook' of 1926, he suggests that: "it focuses on the precise appearance of individual structures. A leading German architect of the interwar period, Mendelsohn was less interested in covering the totality of the modern city than in disseminating captivating visual information. In a review of the book, El Lissitzky writes, "a first leafing through the pages thrills us like a dramatic film. Before our eyes move pictures that are absolutely unique. In order to understand some of the photographs you must lift the book over your head and rotate it. The architect shows us America not from a distance but from within, as he leads us into the canyon of its streets". The relationship to the project is striking and is one of many connections that have emerged as the project has progressed. We are interested in Mendlesohn's public buildings for several reasons. Firstly; their extraordinary fluidity that seems to invite, demand even, a mobile gaze and the architectural language Mendlesohn uses in a deliberate way to captivate the viewer or user. (The demand to promenade is most apparent in the department store and particularly the seaside pavilion) Secondly; the ways his buildings aimed to render visible, or perform, ideological claims in terms of a syntax of use - the way the buildings were designed around the idea of a circulation and movement that is rhetorical. For instance, Mendlesohn designed the Metalworkers Union building to make visible the social and political claims of the union - the workers and union officials move through the building in a way that enacts the principles of democratic decision-making. Similarly he designed the St. Louis synagogue to render visible the idea of a community of faith, merging school with temple and community centre. The temple itself is organised around a 'spine' of light flooding from the Torah Shrine upwards and across the curve of the ceiling. The shooting, completed in December 2005 was helped greatly by the current users or owners of the buildings; Renee Dressner of the GGG (a Germany agency not unlike English Heritage in Britain), Peter Senft of the IGM (the German Metal Workers' Union) and Kathryn Adamchick in St. Louis, and Celia Davies at De La Warr Pavilion. All provided us with every practical help we needed as well extensive historical information about the buildings. In Berlin we were told a great deal about the relationship between the design and how it is intended to embody the ideological priorities of the union - the stairway in particular being the means by which the general membership moves from the street to the congress hall at the top of the building to then pass down its decisions to the offices below. Similarly the role that each building plays in the history and 'self-image' of the respective towns and cities, as well as their histories of use, reuse, decline and refurbishment, is of great interest. Much of what we were told by the numerous people we met does not exist in print, in English translation at least, as far as we are aware. It is of great relevance to the work and suggests the value of a catalogue documenting the work and presenting this research in the future. That the four buildings are either involved in or have a history of restoration, 'adaptive re-use' and refurbishment is also a very productive coincidence. The GGG in Chemnitz are yet to begin the planned refurbishment of the Schocken building, it is currently empty and suffering from its earlier neglect. The IGM building was entirely rebuilt after the Second World War (during which it was destroyed, as a Nazi Workers headquarters, by the Red Army as they captured Berlin) and is in beautiful condition. The De La Warr Pavilion benefits from a recently completed refurbishment and development, and the B'nai Amoona is currently undergoing some alterations. There is a ‘sub-textual’ importance to this ongoing process and as we have recognised it we shot the buildings with this, amongst many others factors, in mind. Each of the buildings was shot in a single day from early morning to night. We approached each of the four buildings quite differently, reflecting their very different qualities and current state. The large open spaces and gradual curves of the frontage of the Schocken building lent themselves to the use of the dolly and 360 degree pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>head.</b> A series of travelling spiral passes were made through the various levels. We also used the 'sled' mount to travel down the linear handrails of the stairways. In the IGM building we focussed on the extraordinary glass, marble and copper spiral staircase. Using the 360 -degree pan and <b>tilt</b> <b>head</b> we mimicked the sinuous movement of the stairs and concentrated on the complex of reflections in the metal and glass elements as the users of the building moved from floor to floor. This use of an approach specific to each site and creating a distinct quality to each of the 'models' produced was continued in the shooting of the final location, the De La Warr Pavilion. Each of the separate ‘buildings’ has been edited as a set of three adjacent and slightly overlapping screens. These three sets of three screens were then adjusted or re-edited in relation to one another to achieve a strict and synchronised interrelationship, or choreography between all twelve moving images. The first exhibition of the finished work was commissioned by and staged at the De La Warr Pavilion. The work is specifically an environmental installation and the configuration of the tables in the space has been the final stage in the construction of the work – through shooting, to editing and installation. The arrangement of the tables has been devised in relation to the exhibition space itself and subject to a number of specific considerations – that there be no single straight route through the space, rather that the space has to be deliberately ‘navigated’, and that there was a position from which all twelve screens could be seen (if for some only at a distance) simultaneously to allow the synchronised movement across all twelve to play a primary part in the experience of the work. The size of the screens both allows for this ‘overview’ of movement across all twelve screens but by also avoiding the risk of overwhelming spectacle, draws the viewer into their relatively intimate individual size...|$|E

40|$|Introduction, definition, {{rationale}} and scope: Lasers are {{now becoming}} {{an integral part}} of dermatological practice in India, with more and more dermatologists starting laser dermatology practice. Lasers, when are used with care, by properly trained operators, in carefully designed environment, can deliver a range of useful aesthetic and dermatologic treatments. Facility: Laser treatment is an office procedure, hence it does not require hospital set-up. The laser room facility requires careful planning keeping in mind safety of both patient and operator, convenience of operating, and optimum handling of costly equipments. The facility should be designed to handle procedures under local anesthesia and sedation. Facilities, staff and equipment to handle any emergencies should be available. Location: A room in existing dermatology clinic can be adequately converted to a laser room. Dimensions of laser room, its door and patient&#x 2032;s table should be such that it should facilitate easy movement of patient, machine trolley, operator and assistant in case of routine procedures and in emergency. Physician Qualification: Any dermatologist with MD or diploma in dermatology can do laser procedures, provided he/ she has acquired necessary skills by virtue of training, observing a competent dermatologist. Such training may be obtained during post graduation or later in specified workshops or courses under a competent dermatologist or at centre which routinely performs such procedures. Electricity and uninterrupted power supply: Laser equipments should be connected to stabilizer or UPS circuits only. Preferably an on line UPS as recommended by the laser company should be installed. Earthing of the equipment is essential to avoid damage to the equipment and electrical shocks to the operator. Sufficient power back up to complete the procedure if power is off midway, is essential. Air-conditioning: Laser machines should be operated in low ambient temperature, with low humidity and dust free environment for longer life of machines. Patient chair: A dental/cosmetic chair with adjustable task light is a suitable option for patient positioning. The chair should have the option to <b>tilt</b> <b>head</b> down or &#x 2032;syncope position&#x 2032; to facilitate resuscitation of a patient in vaso-vagal shock. Maintenance: Annual maintenance contract (AMC) is essential after warranty period is over and is essential for insurance purposes. Mobile Laser Unit: Mobile laser units are of relevance in the Indian context to render laser facility available in smaller towns. A laser with fiber optic delivery system can be made mobile after consultation with supplier. However a laser with an articulated arm delivery cannot be made mobile. Proper packing with shock absorbing material is necessary during transportation. The area where lasers are to be moved to and operated should have appropriate facilities as mentioned above. Records: Patient&#x 2032;s health declaration questionnaires, laser register are essential records. Digital photography before and at regular intervals after procedure is an essential record. Detailed informed consent in patients language for each procedure explaining nature of procedure, anesthesia used, and machine used, post operative down time should be signed by patient. Drugs, anesthesia and sterilization: An electrocautery machine to control bleeding, equipments for airway maintenance, other instruments for emergency resuscitation and an emergency drug tray are essential. Standard sterilization practices are adopted. For most of laser procedures topical anesthesia is sufficient. Safe laser use: Protocols of safe laser use to avoid burns or eye damage to patients or operator are adopted. Reflective surfaces like mirrors, reflective jewelleries are not allowed in laser room. Machine should always be on standby mode when not in direct use. It should be used by authorized operator only. Eye protection: Goggles of sufficient optical density (OD) intended to protect from specific laser wavelength are to be used by all persons in laser room. Patient is given either same goggle or laser opaque shield. For procedures around eyes or on eyelids, internal eye shield made of laser opaque material are to be used. Fire extinguisher complying with local authority fire rules should be available and staff should be trained to use that. Safety and emergency protocols: Protocols for certain situations like vasovagal attack, anaphylaxis, uncontrolled bleeding, fire, accidental eye exposure should be in place and staff should be trained for these situations...|$|E

40|$|When <b>tilting</b> the <b>head</b> {{towards the}} {{shoulder}} {{there are numerous}} mechanisms influencing on the generation and maintenance of ocular counter-roll. Each of these mechanisms has its own temporal and spatial characteristics which influences on the counter-rolled eye position. We described a fast transient anti-compensatory torsion movement (torsion peak) as the first response to the <b>head</b> <b>tilting</b> which most certainly has its origin in the vestibular organ and the utricular maculae. Superimposed on this torsion peak we described nystagmus beats with the fast phase directed {{in the same direction}} as the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> movement suggesting a paralleled activation of the vertical semicircular canals. Synchronous with the torsion peak a fast vertical vergence eye movement was seen. The vertical vergence was always with left eye over right eye in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and always with right eye over left eye the leftward <b>head</b> <b>tilts,</b> thus inducing a physiological skew deviation. The aetiology for this fast vertical vergence response is currently unknown but could probably be explained by a similar vestibular mechanism as for the torsion peak. A substantial amount of ocular counter-rolling (OCR) was a consistent finding in all subjects and test conditions during static <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The OCR increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> but the relative compensation to the amount of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> decreased. For example, a 15 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced 3 ° OCR which corresponds to a gain of 0. 20. A 30 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced an even larger OCR (5 °) which corresponds to a gain of 0. 16. A consistent finding was an OCR disconjugacy of the right and left eye which increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> For instance, a rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a larger ex-cyclo of the left eye than incyclo of the right eye leading to an ex-cyclovergence. The underlying mechanism might be the increased saccular impact in extreme <b>head</b> <b>tilts.</b> Sacculus has been suggested to induce disconjugate OCR while utriculus is thought to induce conjugate OCR. The static <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a vertical disconjugacy (i. e. vertical vergence) that increased with the <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The direction of the eye position was however not consistent. Some subjects demonstrated a right eye over left eye position in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilts</b> while others demonstrated the opposite outcome. This might be explained by a difference in the ocular visual and torsional axes. To maintain binocularity the eyes are forced into vergence and depending on the position of the axes the direction of the vergence movement will differ. When holding the <b>head</b> in a <b>tilted</b> position the torsional position is found to drift. Initially this drift was directed away from the reference position thus increasing the amount of OCR. After a minute the drift was found to change direction and heading towards the reference position, thus decreasing the OCR. The OCR increasing drift might be explained by a decline in the leftward utricular discharge, induced by macula inertia during the initial interaural translation, in favour of the rightward utricular gravitational discharge. The OCR decreasing drift might be explained by an adaptation of the utricular maculae. Other possible explanations might be a leaky neural integrator or a vestibular memory loss which could induce the OCR decreasing drift found during a sustained <b>head</b> <b>tilt...</b>|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{information}} is two-dimensional, whereas eye movements are three-dimensional. The oculomotor system solves this degrees-of-freedom problem by constraining eye positions to zero torsion (Listing's law) and determining how eye velocities change with eye position (half-angle rule). Here we test whether the oculomotor plant, {{in the absence}} of well-defined neural commands, can implement these constrains mechanically, not just in a primary position but for all eye and head orientations. We stimulated the abducens nerve at tertiary eye positions and when ocular counterroll was induced at <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> orientations. Stimulation-induced eye velocities follow the half-angle rule, even for tertiary eye positions, and microstimulation at <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> orientations elicits eye positions that adhere to torsionally shifted planes, similar to naturally occurring eye movements. These results support the notion that oculomotor plant can continuously apply these three-dimensional rules correctly and appropriately for all eye and head orientations that obey Listing's law, demonstrating a major role of peripheral biomechanics in motor control...|$|R
