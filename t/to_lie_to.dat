5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She tried to find a job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant that people were unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because that job did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her mother, who was ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she had <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{rationale for}} many of the hearsay exceptions is that the circumstances of a particular statement make them reliable enough to be heard by a trier of fact.

25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, {{men are more likely}} to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while women are more likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> please others. We are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where we are able to use lies and deception to enhance our chances of survival and reproduction. Stereotypically speaking, men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.|$|E

25|$|To many, the specialness {{of health}} care meant that cost {{should not be a}} {{consideration}} in care. Ethical physicians could and should not consider money in deciding what they should do for sick patients. Patients were to receive whatever services they needed, regardless of its cost. Reasoning based on cost has been strenuously resisted; it violated the Hippocratic Oath, was associated with rationing, and derided as putting a price on life, akin to the economist who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. Indeed, many physicians were willing <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> get patients what they needed from insurance companies that were trying to hold costs down.|$|E

40|$|Priming is a non-conscious memory effect, {{in which}} {{exposure}} to one stimulus affects {{the response to}} another. Following priming theories, we propose an innovative view that people who perceived politicians as being dishonest (<b>lying)</b> are likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> themselves. <b>To</b> examine this view, three scenario-based studies (N = 218) were conducted; primers included the clergy, named French Presidents and political parties. Study 1 demonstrated that participants with clergy priming were less likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> (compared <b>to</b> politician priming). Study 2 indicated that participants with Sarkozy priming were more likely <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> (compared <b>to</b> Hollande priming). Study 3 found that Sarkozy priming effect may originate from his political party rather Sarkozy himself. These findings suggest that lying can be triggered by external influencers such as government leaders and politicians and this provides an alternative perspective to the current view of lying as interest-driven or self-protection behaviour, implications follow...|$|R

25|$|Sarah Dozier, Johnston's niece, filed {{a motion}} asking a federal judge for {{sanctions}} against the city of Atlanta because she said it had withheld documents in a wrongful death lawsuit. Dozier's suit against the city had claimed that the incentives for the police <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> obtain the warrant involved the quota system, which gives officers quotas for arrests and warrants. According to Dozier's motion, Lawyers for Johnston's family had asked the Atlanta Police Department for documents about the quotas before the trial began; the police chief had denied {{the existence of the}} quota system and the department indicated that there were no such documents. Dozier's motion claims that her lawyers obtained the documents another way and that APD officers had verified their authenticity during pretrial testimony. Alex White, the man the officers had used as their informant, also filed a lawsuit against Atlanta and police, claiming officers had held him against his will to pressure him to lie for the cover-up. In August 2010, Johnston's family was awarded $4.9 million in a settlement.|$|E
