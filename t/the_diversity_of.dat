30|$|Since the BER is linearly {{proportional}} to the UPEP PEP^NC (d|W_d) via corresponding input weights, <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> order <b>of</b> NCC is equal to <b>diversity</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UPEP.

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> minority interests {{is expressed in}} his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>of</b> the {{originally}} {{broadly defined}} Liliaceae s.l., many {{attempts have been}} made to form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E
