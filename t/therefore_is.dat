5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, <b>therefore,</b> <b>is</b> not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E

He was able to save Panamon and Shea after they were {{captured}} by Trolls because he had been awarded the Black Irix, the highest honor any Troll can receive, and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> considered incapable of treachery. The Trolls then helped them get to Skull Mountain so that Shea could confront the Warlock Lord.|$|E

5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperature}} stability, low vapor pressure, {{good wear resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (sublimes at ~360°C) and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> removed during the discharge.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, <b>therefore,</b> <b>is</b> related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E

5|$|Horner did {{not perform}} an exact {{cladistic}} analysis determining {{the relationship between the}} three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, {{as a consequence of the}} method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.|$|E
5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this is the effect of {{samarium}} or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E
5|$|The {{extreme length}} of Æthelberht's reign {{also has been}} {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E

Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} {{reflects the}} uninterrupted terms in office {{served by a}} single man.

Teófilo Braga served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> {{not considered to be}} the first President, although he would serve again as head of state and be the second president after the resignation of Manuel de Arriaga. However, Bernardino Machado served two non-consecutive terms, and he is counted as both the third and the eighth presidents.

5|$|When Obbink {{published}} the Brothers Poem, he attributed it to Sappho {{based on its}} metre, dialect (Aeolic), and references to Charaxos and Larichos, known from other sources to have been Sappho's brothers.

Nonetheless, evidence provided by Herodotus indicates that Charaxos was mentioned in poems that were attributed to Sappho during the fifth century BC; it <b>therefore</b> <b>is</b> likely that the poem is at least authentically from archaic Lesbos.|$|E
