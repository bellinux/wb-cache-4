50|$|The Marangoni {{effect is}} the {{convection}} of fluid along an interface between dissimilar substances because of variations in surface <b>tension.</b> <b>Surface</b> tension can vary because of inhomogeneous {{composition of the}} substances or the temperature-dependence of surface tension forces.

50|$|The ambient {{temperature}} of the body directly affects blood flow through microvasculature. Changes in temperature affect the viscosity of blood and the surface <b>tension.</b> <b>Surface</b> tension decreases with increasing temperature, decreasing the minimum flow rate (see Surface Tension). The decrease in minimum flow rate by higher temperatures allows more blood to flow and dissipate heat throughout the body. Temperature greatly affects blood flow by influencing the diameter of flow. Decreases and increases in temperature trigger vasoconstriction and vasodilation respectively.|$|E
50|$|Since {{a liquid}} {{with a high}} <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> pulls more {{strongly}} on the surrounding liquid than one with a low <b>surface</b> <b>tension,</b> {{the presence of a}} gradient in <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (<b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> is a function of temperature).|$|R

Usually geotextiles are {{placed at the}} <b>tension</b> <b>surface</b> to strengthen the soil. Geotextiles are also used for sand dune armoring to protect upland coastal property from storm surge, wave action and flooding. A large sand-filled container (SFC) within the dune system prevents storm erosion from proceeding beyond the SFC. Using a sloped unit rather than a single tube eliminates damaging scour.|$|E
50|$|Generally, high {{performance}} waterballs have little friction on the water, {{they are relatively}} small in size and density making them generally a handball size. With {{a certain amount of}} force they skip, bounce and glide in a straight line on the water surface and can travel fast and long distance. They can be projected on the water between players at a range of 3- 200 feet as there is very little friction slow them on the water surface - particularly the sealed waterball. Each time they bounce, skip or roll on the water surface, the inertia is reduced by opposing forces of gravity, friction, surface <b>tension,</b> <b>surface</b> drag.|$|E
5000|$|... 't Hooft found {{a simple}} formula for the {{scalings}} of the Wilson and 't Hooft operators {{in the various}} phases. When a given operator is confined, a finite <b>tension</b> <b>surface</b> is created whose boundary is the operator. The action of the configuration, in the limit in which the configuration is large, therefore scales with the volume of this surface. In the confining phase the Wilson loops are confined by a 2-dimensional surface, and so the action of a Wilson loop scales as the area of this surface. In the Higgs phase the (d-3)-dimensional 't Hooft operator is confined, and so the action scales as {{the area of the}} (d-2)-dimensional confining surface. For example in the confining phase in 4 space-time dimensions the action of the 't Hooft operator scales as the distance squared. In the mixed phase both operators are confined, and so both obey this scaling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We perform energy {{estimates}} for a sharp-interface model of two-dimensional, two-phase Darcy flow with <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b> A proof of well-posedness {{of the initial}} value problem follows from these estimates. In general, the time of existence of these solutions will go to zero as the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> parameter vanishes. We then make two additional estimates, in the case that a stability condition is satisfied by the initial data: we make an additional energy estimate which is uniform in the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> parameter, and we make an estimate for the difference of two solutions with different values of the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> parameter. These additional estimates allow the zero <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> limit to be taken, showing that solutions of the initial value problem {{in the absence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> are the limit of solutions of the initial value problem with <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> as <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> vanishes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> {{of molten}} silicon are reported. For marangoni flow, the {{important}} parameter is the variation of <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> with temperature, not {{the absolute value}} of the <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b> It {{is not possible to}} calculate temperature coefficients using <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> measurements from different experiments because the systematic errors are usually larger than the changes in <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> because of temperature variations. The lack of good <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> data for liquid silicon is probably due to its extreme chemical reactivity. A material which resists attack by molten silicon is not found.

40|$|We report {{calculations}} of the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> of the water-air interface using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We investigate the simulation cell size {{dependence of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> of water from force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which show that the calculated <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> increases with increasing simulation cell size, thereby illustrating that a correction for finite size effects {{is required for the}} small system used in the AIMD simulation. The AIMD simulations reveal that the double-ξ basis set overestimates the experimentally measured <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> due to the Pulay stress, while the triple and quadruple-ξ basis sets give similar results. We further demonstrate that the van der Waals corrections critically affect the <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b> AIMD simulations without the van der Waals correction substantially underestimate the <b>surface</b> <b>tension,</b> while van der Waals correction with the Grimme's D 2 technique results in the value for the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> that is too high. The Grimme's D 3 van der Waals correction provides a <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> close to the experimental value. Whereas the specific choices for the van der Waals correction and basis sets critically affect the calculated <b>surface</b> <b>tension,</b> the <b>surface</b> <b>tension</b> is remarkably insensitive to the details of the exchange and correlation functionals, which highlights the impact of long-range interactions on the <b>surface</b> <b>tension.</b> These simulated values provide important benchmarks, both for improving van der Waals corrections, and AIMD simulations of aqueous interfaces.
