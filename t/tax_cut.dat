5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and a capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E
5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform.

5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.|$|E
5|$|When a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> {{passed over}} Buckner's veto in 1890drained the state treasury, the {{governor}} loaned the state {{enough money to}} remain solvent until tax revenue came in.

30|$|Never were <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> an easy task. Empirical {{evidence}} from tax reforms {{around the world}} demonstrates that ample tax revenues should be ensured before cuts can be made. <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be made in consideration of our nation’s economic structure, i.e., income from other sources {{could be used to}} offset deficiencies of disposable income brought about by <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be linked to the government’s budget reforms and used to elevate the efficiency of government expenditures by increasing the transparency of public budgets. <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should also be linked into the structure of national public expenditures, thus opening up more room for <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> by shutting down any projects which have already been out of date.|$|R

5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E
50|$|A 2006 Treasury Department study {{estimated}} that the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> reduced revenue by approximately 1.5% GDP on average {{for each of the}} first four years after their implementation, an approximately 6% annual reduction in revenue relative to a baseline without those <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The study also indicated the Kennedy <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> of 1962 and Reagan <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> of 1981 reduced revenue.

The cost of these measures, most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees.

50|$|On October 30, 2007, the Conservatives tabled an {{economic}} statement (similar to a mini-budget) and announced various <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and exemptions.

5000|$|Another {{important}} reason for the recent expansion of the AMT {{is the effect of}} the 2001-2006 Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> decreased marginal <b>tax</b> rates for all income tax brackets without making corresponding changes to AMT rates.
