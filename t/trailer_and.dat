40|$|CDC {{wanted to}} find out the {{formaldehyde}} levels in occupied FEMA-supplied <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes and what things about those <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes could affect formaldehyde levels. We also wanted to help FEMA decide when and how to move residents out of these <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes in the Gulf Coast area. We took an indoor air sample for one full hour, and measured indoor temperature and relative humidity. We also asked adult residents about themselves, what they did in the <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes <b>and</b> about their <b>trailer</b> or mobile home, to learn about other things that could affect formaldehyde levels. Finally, we walked through each trailer or mobile home to look for anything else that could affect formaldehyde levels inside. In many <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes formaldehyde levels were higher than usual in indoor air in most homes in the United States. Average levels of formaldehyde in all travel <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes were about 77 parts per billion (ppb). Formaldehyde levels were different in different types of mobile homes <b>and</b> travel <b>trailers,</b> but all types tested had some high levels. At levels found in some <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes, formaldehyde exposure could affect health. Travel trailers had significantly higher average formaldehyde levels than mobile homes. CDC also found that temperature, humidity, <b>trailer</b> type <b>and</b> brand, keeping windows open, and mold affected formaldehyde levels. his study looked only at current formaldehyde levels in the occupied <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes. Our study was done in the winter months of December 2007 through January 2008, when people had already lived in the <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes for two years. The formaldehyde level was probably higher in newer <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes and when the weather was warmer. Based on what we found and on scientific reports about health effects linked with formaldehyde exposure, CDC recommended that FEMA move residents of the Gulf Coast area displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita out of travel <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> mobile homes. We recommended that people with symptoms that could be linked to formaldehyde and vulnerable populations such as children, elderly, and individuals with chronic diseases be moved first.
