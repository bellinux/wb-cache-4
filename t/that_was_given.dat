5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory was {{received}} with mixed reviews. Canadian Online Explorer pro wrestling section writer Matt Bishop graded the event a 7 out of 10, {{the same as}} last year's event. He stated, “TNA's biggest show of the year, Bound For Glory, was a mix of good and bad. The show's biggest matches delivered on a show that featured a weak undercard”. He also gave the main event 8 out of 10, and the Lethal Lockdown match 7 out of 10. His lowest scores were for the Knockouts Title match <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> a 2 out of 10 and the Young-Jordan versus Neal-Moore match that was rated a dud.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given.</b> In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E

5|$|Lacks {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to the land in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the Lacks family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the Lacks family who were descendants of African slaves and their white owners.|$|E

The next day, Paulus was visited in her office at the Oregon Capitol {{by the president of}} the statewide Oregon Lions Club. He had come to ask Paulus to return the Portland club's gift. He did not think the statue – or membership into the club – should have been given to a woman.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> Royal Assent on 11 November 1999. The Act {{reformed}} the House of Lords, one of {{the chambers}} of Parliament. For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the Act removed such a right. However, {{as part of a}} compromise, the Act did permit ninety-two hereditary peers to remain in the House on an interim basis. Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House.|$|E
5|$|Years later, after Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him again, but Rodrigues refuses, {{saying he}} is no longer a priest. Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch he claims to have won while {{gambling}} containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated.

5|$|An {{open and}} spacious ground floor {{respected}} the same traditional layout exemplified in Besakana and other Merina homes, including {{the presence of}} hearth stones in their customary corner. Following traditional construction practices, the roof three stories above was supported by an enormous andry (central pillar) <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> the name Volamihitsy ("Genuine Silver"). According to popular legend, this was made of a single rosewood tree trunk transported from the eastern rain forests. Recent archaeological excavations of the site during reconstruction have since disproved this account as the pillar {{was found to be}} a composite of fitted rosewood pieces rather than a single solid post. According to custom, the north-eastern corner pillar was the first to be erected. Its length necessitated the use of a pulley designed by Jean Laborde, the principal architect, to haul the trunk into place. When an accident occurred during the operation, the queen designated a Malagasy carpenter to manufacture a crane to complete the task. Thousands of the queen's subjects were forced to labour on the building's construction in lieu of paying cash taxes pursuant to a tradition called fanampoana. One historic source claimed that 25,000 subjects participated in the raising of the building's corner posts alone. The harsh working conditions were said to have been the cause of many deaths, although precise figures are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1988, {{the demand}} for a {{separate}} state of Gorkhaland and Kamtapur based on ethnic lines grew strong. Riots between the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the West Bengal government reached a stand-off after a forty-day strike. The town was virtually under siege, and the state government called in the Indian army to maintain law and order. This {{led to the formation}} of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, a body <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> semi-autonomous powers to govern the Darjeeling district, except the area under the Siliguri subdivision. Since 2007, {{the demand for}} a separate Gorkhaland state has been revived by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and its supporters in the Darjeeling hills. The Kamtapur People's Party and its supporters' movement for a separate Kamtapur state covering North Bengal have gained momentum.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{spent her}} days writing; her main project {{was a book}} about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also {{maintained}} an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary {{as part of the}} Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to another.|$|E
5|$|Nipper was {{inducted}} into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame, as well as being inducted into the Tennessee Agriculture Hall of Fame.

In the 1980s, she was selected to paint a horse-themed plate <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to American president Ronald Reagan who also owned a Nipper painting on canvas. In 1982, her work was displayed in the Fine Arts Pavilion at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2012, Nipper painted an ornament that decorated the Christmas tree at the Governor of Tennessee's mansion. Nipper was also commissioned to paint pictures for Zsa Zsa Gabor and Shania Twain.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight. On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, while the company gave its position away quickly. An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit {{on one of the}} company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, and ended up in Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E
