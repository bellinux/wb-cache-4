The first film was released on 18 November 2016 and the next two are due {{to be released in}} 2018 and 2020. Rowling wrote the screenplay for the first instalment, marking her first foray into screenwriting.|$|E
5|$|Another {{objective}} {{to finding}} and defeating Malkil in Wizards & WarriorsIII {{is to find}} four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle's throne room where the evil wizard is located. To do this, Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E

Her runes are {{the most}} benign to the Dwarfs themselves, for they inspire and {{invigorate}} <b>them,</b> <b>willing</b> <b>them</b> to continue fighting even when all seems lost, and are most often emblazoned on banners. She is the most peaceful of the Ancestor Gods.|$|R

Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then one of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> win.|$|E

5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on <b>them</b> <b>will</b> sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s.

After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in <b>them</b> <b>will</b> collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E

5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows {{on the ground in}} {{deciduous}} or mixed woods, usually in association with pine trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish-black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A.subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A.subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous, and consuming <b>them</b> <b>will</b> result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness.|$|E

Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) stands by his {{requirement}} that glee club must place at Regionals to continue, despite director Will Schuester's (Matthew Morrison) protestation that Sue is attempting to sabotage <b>them.</b> <b>Will</b> turns to guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), who reveals that she has begun dating her dentist, Carl Howell.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between <b>them</b> <b>will</b> work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above <b>them</b> <b>will</b> sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E

5|$|The Avengers become divided, both {{over how}} to {{approach}} Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk {{falls to the ground}} after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating <b>them</b> <b>will</b> not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E
5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from <b>them)</b> <b>will</b> end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E
