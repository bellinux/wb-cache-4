25|$|Mia admires Lilly's {{bravery and}} unwillingness {{to be pushed}} around by others though Lilly knows her {{insensitivity}} and forceful personality can cause her to be disliked.

In 1934, Pearl left China, believing she would return, while John Lossing Buck remained.|$|E

25|$|Her {{principal}} symbol is the spiked wheel, {{which has}} become known as the Catherine wheel, and her feast day is celebrated on 25 November by most Christian churches. However, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates it on 24 November. The exact origin of this tradition is not known. In 11th-century Kyivan-Rus, the feast day was celebrated on 25 November. Saint Dimitry of Rostov in his Kniga zhyttia sviatykh (Book of the Lives of the Saints), T.1 (1689) places the date of celebration on 24 November. A story that Empress Catherine the Great did not wish <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>her</b> patronal feast with the Leavetaking of the feast of the Presentation of the Theotokos and hence changed the date is not supported by historical evidence. One of the first Roman Catholic churches to be built in Russia, the Catholic Church of St. Catherine, was named after Catherine of Alexandria because she was Catherine the Great's patron.|$|E
