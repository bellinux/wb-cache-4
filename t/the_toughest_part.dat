500|$|Two years later, Sharma {{played the}} leading {{lady in the}} crime-comedy Badmaash Company, {{directed}} by Parmeet Sethi and co-starring Shahid Kapoor, Vir Das and Meiyang Chang. The film, dealing with four underachieving friends who begin a scam business enterprise, met with mixed reviews. Later in 2010, Sharma completed her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films by starring in Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh. Her role was that of Shruti Kakkar, an ambitious middle-class Punjabi girl who starts her own wedding planning business. In preparation for the part, Sharma learned to speak in the Punjabi dialect, which she cited as <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> of her role; she described the way the lead characters in the film interact as [...] "crude but cute" [...] which required her to [...] "talk fast, sometimes mix words and even omit words completely".|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Tracy {{appeared}} in The Old Man and the Sea, {{a project that}} had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same name, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: [...] "Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy." [...] Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a [...] "terrible liability to the picture", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight. Appearing alone on screen {{for the majority of the}} film, Tracy considered The Old Man and the Sea <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality." [...] Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.|$|E
500|$|The {{route of}} the 2015 edition of the race was only {{slightly}} adjusted {{from that of the}} 2014 edition, with two climbs added to the route in the first , the Tiegemberg and the Berendries.

The first part of the route was a [...] route south to the city of Kortrijk, passing through Zwevezele, Ardooie and Izegem. This part of the route was almost entirely flat.

500|$|McGovern was {{assigned}} to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: [...] "Learning how to fly the B‑24 was <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> of the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because {{in the early part}} of the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time." [...] Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband's suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war. This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.|$|E

[...] Deryn spends the remainder of her inheritance to come to London and live with her brother, where she studies to take the Midshipman exams to get into the British Air Service like her brother, but <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> is acting the role of boy, which she'll have to pull off in order to be accepted. It is her lucky day when her airman test goes awry and she is scooped up by the Leviathan and finishes her tests up there in order to serve aboard as a Midshipman. [...] She is able to best many of the Middies at learning the ropes because she went up so frequently with her father and because she pays attention during class. [...] She does her best to hide that she is a girl from everyone on board, though the observant eye of Dr. Barlow has noticed the lack of a beard on her chin. Luckily, Barlow has attributed it to Deryn lying about her age rather than being a girl. [...] As she gets to know Alek, she realizes that she owes him her life and, after he hugs her, that she may even have feelings for him, though she quickly tries to squelch that.|$|E

60|$|I had {{dispensed}} with the monkey, {{after trying to}} get along with the creature for an hour or two, and went around only with my music. I would rather manage an army of anti-renters than one monkey. With the hurdy-gurdy slung around my neck, therefore, I followed my uncle, who actually sold another watch before we reached a tavern. Of course we did not presume to go to Congress Hall, or the Eagle, for we knew we should not be admitted. This was <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> <b>part</b> of our adventures. I am of opinion my uncle made a mistake; for he ventured to a second-class house, under the impression that one of the sort usually frequented by men of our supposed stamp might prove too coarse for us altogether. I think we should have been better satisfied with the coarse fare of a coarse tavern, than with the shabby-genteel of the house we blundered into. In the former, everything would have reminded us, in a way we expected to be reminded, that we were out of the common track; and we might have been amused with the change, though it is one singularly hard to be endured. I remember to have heard a young man, accustomed from childhood to the better habits of the country, but who went to sea, a lad before the mast, declare that the coarseness of his shipmates--and there is no vulgarity about a true sailor, even when coarsest--gave him more trouble to overcome, than all the gales, physical sufferings, labor, exposures and dangers, put together. I must confess, I have found it so, too, in my little experience. While acting as a strolling musician, I could get along with anything better than the coarse habits which I encountered at the table. Your silver-forkisms, and your purely conventional customs, as a matter of course, no man of the world attaches any serious importance to; but there are conventionalities that belong to the fundamental principles of civilized society, which become second nature, and with which it gets to be hard, indeed, to dispense. I shall say as little as possible of the disagreeables of my new trade, therefore, but stick to the essentials.|$|E
