5|$|The Multnomah {{name for}} Mount Hood was Wy'east. In {{one version of}} the legend, the two sons of the Great Spirit Sahale {{fell in love with}} the {{beautiful}} maiden Loowit, who could not decide which to choose. The two braves, Wy'east and Pahto, burned forests and villages in their battle over her. Sahale became enraged and smote the three lovers. Seeing what he had done, he erected three mountain peaks to mark where each fell. He made beautiful Mount St. Helens for Loowit, proud and erect Mount Hood for Wy'east, and <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> Mount Adams for the mourning Pahto.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a gradual}} change from <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> mood {{of his work}} in the Netherlands to a far more varied and {{expressive}} approach as he began introducing brighter color into his work. He painted many still life paintings of flowers, experimenting with color, light and techniques he learned from several different modern artists before moving on to other subjects.|$|E
25|$|During the album's tour, {{the band}} was plagued by Chamberlin's heroin addiction. On July 12, 1996, touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin died of a drug {{overdose}} in a hotel room. Chamberlin {{was present at the}} scene but could not revive him. The Pumpkins made the decision to fire Chamberlin and continue as a trio. This shakeup, coupled with Corgan going through a divorce and the death of his mother, influenced <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> mood of the band's next album, 1998's Adore. Featuring a darker, more subdued and heavily electronic sound at a time when alternative rock was declining in mainstream cachet, Adore divided both critics and fans, resulting in a significant decrease in album sales (it sold 1.3 million discs in the US).|$|E
25|$|Also {{during that}} stage, Macedonski was {{exploring}} the numerous links between Symbolism, mysticism and esotericism. Earlier pieces had already come to explore macabre themes characteristic {{for an early}} branch of Symbolism. Influenced by Maurice Rollinat, they include <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> Vaporul morții ("The Ship of Death") and Visul fatal ("The Fatal Dream"). Likewise, the piece titled Imnul lui Satan ("Satan's Hymn") was placed by critics in connection with Les Litanies de Satan (part of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own vision of the world. This interest also reflected in his 1893 Saul, where Cincinat Pavelescu's contribution is supposedly minimal. Echoing satanic themes, Ernest Legouvé's dramatic version of the Medea myth (which Macedonski translated {{at some point in}} his life) and the classical work of Jean Racine, it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his ephebos-like protégé David, the latter of whom {{turns out to be the}} agent of spiritual revolution.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, laments {{the aftermath of}} a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. The music video garnered mixed to positive reviews from critics; some praised the spectacular visual sense in portraying <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> mood while others criticized its inadequate narrative. Swift has performed [...] "Back to December" [...] in several live appearances, notably at the 44th annual Country Music Association Awards and at the 38th American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|One of the motifs in {{the story}} is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this {{is used as a}} plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the {{favorite}} foods of the five main heroines. Newtype USA stated in an article on Kanon that [...] "it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive", despite <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai).|$|E
500|$|Deakins {{cinematography}} was routinely praised, with The Hollywood Reporter {{calling it}} [...] "foreboding" [...] and [...] "well-crafted," [...] and Travers saying [...] "the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... {{you can almost}} feel the frustration and rage seeping into {{the skin of the}} inmates". Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the [...] "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" [...] that makes the film very realistic. The Hollywood Reporter said of Newman's score, [...] "at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central them," [...] and Klady describing it as [...] "the right balance between <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> and the absurd".|$|E

500|$|The choral anthems, {{including}} Remember not, Lord, our offences, that Purcell composed {{after his}} appointment to Westminster and before his appointment at the Chapel Royal {{are described as}} his [...] "last concentrated involvement with the verse anthem without strings." [...] After 1681, Purcell began including string accompaniments to his choral anthems—a shift that musicologist Martin Adams attributes to having more resources available to him with his appointment to the Chapel Royal. [...] Adams states that the anthems of this period included revisions of earlier works, including his well-known setting of the Anglican funeral sentences, and that these works are [...] "distinguished by complex contrapuntal textures, a concentration on a limited quantity of motivic material, and <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> expression of penitential texts." [...] Purcell's anthems reflect the influence of compositional techniques developed by earlier composers William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons. These anthems {{are closely related to}} those composed by Purcell's friend and teacher, John Blow, [...] "with their basso seguente continuo and severe counterpoint, they are true stile antico." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the good-time fun of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35", the Chicago blues-influenced [...] "Pledging My Time" [...] sets <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> {{tone that}} runs through the album. It draws on several {{traditional}} blues songs, including Elmore James' recording of [...] "It Hurts Me Too". For critic Michael Gray, the lines [...] "Somebody got lucky but it was an accident" [...] echo the lines [...] "Some joker got lucky, stole her back again" [...] from Robert Johnson's [...] "Come On in My Kitchen", which is itself an echo of the Skip James 1931 recording [...] "Devil Got My Woman". Gray suggests that [...] "the gulping movements of the melodic phrases" [...] derive from the melody of [...] "Sitting on Top of the World", recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet {{at the end of each}} verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she [...] "will come through, too". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus [...] "Pig" [...] Robbins's blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] in March.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} some months off, R.E.M. {{returned to the}} studio in 1991 to record its next album. Late in 1992, the band released Automatic for the People. Though the group had intended to make a harder-rocking album after the softer textures of Out of Time, <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> Automatic for the People [...] " [...] to move at an even more agonized crawl", according to Melody Maker. The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by [...] "that sense of... turning thirty", according to Buck. Several songs featured string arrangements by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Considered {{by a number of}} critics (as well as by Buck and Mills) to be the band's best album, Automatic for the People reached numbers one and two on UK and US charts, respectively, and generated the American Top 40 hit singles [...] "Drive", [...] "Man on the Moon", and [...] "Everybody Hurts". The album would sell over fifteen million copies worldwide. As with Out of Time, there was no tour in support of the album. The decision to forgo a tour, in conjunction with Stipe's physical appearance, generated rumors that the singer was dying or HIV-positive, which were vehemently denied by the band.|$|E
50|$|The music {{changes to}} match {{the mood of the}} director’s questions. With more {{exciting}} topics such as sex being discussed, a violin caprice by Niccolò Paganini is played. During <b>the</b> more <b>somber</b> moments, a slow piano prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach is performed.|$|R

500|$|Shadowrun {{has been}} {{positively}} recounted in many retrospective lists and articles. It was listed {{it as the}} 34th best SNES game by Super Play in 1996, {{as well as the}} 48th best game on any Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power in 1997. Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun [...] "didn't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes" [...] it was still [...] "a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we can forgive the game for only being 90% groundbreaking." [...] The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which [...] "Shadowruns moody music and dark streets set <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative." [...] Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009. IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was [...] "without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era" [...] because it presented players with [...] "a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop" [...] blended with traditional RPG elements in an [...] "irresistible" [...] way. That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games [...] "ahead of their time" [...] for its use of a keyword dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time.|$|E
500|$|Distinguished {{for being}} the remake's [...] "most powerful" [...] {{original}} song, [...] "Evermore" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "big" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] number by music critics. A [...] "soaring ballad" [...] bolstered by [...] "grand orchestration", WTOP's Jason Fraley described [...] "Evermore" [...] as a [...] "haunting song of longing"; a [...] "mournful love song" [...] that crescendos into a powerful lament about lost love. An emotionally delivered power ballad, the Belfast Telegraph agreed that the ballad is [...] "a soaring lament of longing". The accompaniment begins with the Beast's [...] "eerie" [...] theme before transitioning into a solo, first emerging from the film's [...] "Rose" [...] theme before taking on its central melody and instrumental bridge. Despite being a miserable [...] "lovesick ballad", <b>the</b> <b>somber</b> tone of which Chris Knight of the National Post likened to songs from the musical Les Misérables, the ballad is a more upbeat offering than its Broadway counterpart, [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "captur the elaborate aesthetic of musical theatre". However, the track remains one of the more melancholy inclusions on a soundtrack that consists of largely upbeat songs and musical numbers, contributing a sense of emotional depth to the album. Writing for Elle, Alyssa Bailey dubbed the song a [...] "Broadway version of a breakup ballad", which features the lyrics [...] "I let her steal into my melancholy heart/It's more than I can bear," [...] as [...] "swoon" [...] by Stevens. Musically, the track bares similarities to songs from Disney's animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), which Menken himself also composed, as well as the work of musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E
500|$|Five {{other music}} video were {{produced}} {{to promote the}} album's singles. While the video for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was taken from live footage of Jackson's concerts, those for [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Alright" [...] utilized a Broadway-influenced production. The video for [...] "Alright" [...] was an homage to choreographer Michael Kidd, who was asked {{to participate in the}} project and also featured appearances by the flash dancing Nicholas Brothers, actress Cyd Charisse and bandleader Cab Calloway. An extended version of the video also features rapper Heavy D. <b>The</b> <b>somber</b> video for [...] "Come Back To Me" [...] was filmed near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Similarly, [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] was a notable departure from the typically elaborate choreography associated with Jackson's other videos, focusing on her as an individual rather than {{as a part of a}} dancing troupe. Featuring appearances by Antonio Sabàto, Jr. and Djimon Hounsou, the sandy beach setting exemplifies director Herb Ritts [...] "signature style through use of graceful movements, bold contrasts, and wide-open spaces." [...] The music video is also regarded as the origin of what would later become Jackson's sexually overt persona, freely displaying her legs, torso and cleavage, as well as touching her own bare skin and Sabàto, Jr's in a sensual manner. In Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992), Anthony DeCurtis states that [...] "he video celebrates hedonism and voyeurism; there are languorous displays of Jackson's body in ripped jeans and brief top, and of several muscular male bodies, black and white, with bare arms, and chests." [...] She received the MTV Video Vanguard Award, regarded as MTV's highest honor for artists whose videography has significantly impacted pop culture.|$|E
