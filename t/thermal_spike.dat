Their normalized yields are independent of energy of the irradiating Cs+. Collision cascades cannot explain the simultaneous sputtering of atoms and molecules.

The fractal dimension of binary collision cascades of atomic recoils in the irradiated ZnO solid increases with reduction in the energy of recoils. Upon reaching the collision diameters of atomic dimensions, the space-filling fractal-like transition occurs where cascades transform into <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes.</b> These localized <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes</b> induce sublimation, dissociation and sputtering from the region.

50|$|High {{electrical}} resistance: Non-conducting dielectric minerals, glasses, and polymers {{have this}} property, while highly conducting {{metals and alloys}} do not have this property.

50|$|According to the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> model, the {{electron}} collision cascade {{is responsible for}} the energy transfer between the projectile ion and the target nuclei. If the temperature exceeds the melting temperature of the target substance, a liquid is formed. The rapid quenching leaves behind an amorphous state with decreased density.

50|$|Based {{on these}} theories, {{there should be}} two {{different}} regions, each retaining a different form of damage, along {{the path of a}} PKA. A <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> should occur in the earlier part of the path, and this high-energy region retains vacancy-interstitial pairs.

40|$|Using {{large-scale}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations, we predict that knock-on damage in irradiated metallic glasses leads to spontaneous anisotropic deformation, i. e., shape {{change in the}} absence of externally applied loads. The root cause of this behavior is anisotropic plastic deformation around nonspherical <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>spikes</b> are nanoscale regions whose temperature briefly rises to several thousand K, causing rapid localized melting and quenching. Thermal spike-induced plasticity (TSIP) does not depend on electronic excitations and is distinct from the ion hammer effect.

40|$|This thesis studies radiation-induced mixing at {{interfaces}} between {{low solubility}} metals using molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. It provides original contributions on the fundamental mechanisms of radiation-induced mixing and morphological stability of multilayer nanocomposites under heavy ion or neutron radiation. An embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic potential is constructed {{to reproduce the}} main topological features of the experimental equilibrium phase diagram of the Cu-Nb system in both solid and liquid states. Compared with two previously available EAM Cu-Nb potentials, the phase diagram of the current potential shows better agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The newly constructed potential predicts that the Cu-Nb liquid phase at equilibrium is compositionally patterned over lengths of about 2. 3 nm. All three Cu-Nb potentials have the same solid phase behavior but different liquid phase properties, serving as a convenient set of model systems to study the effect of liquid phase properties on radiation-induced mixing. To study radiation-induced intermixing, a specialized MD simulation is developed that models multiple 10 keV collision cascades sequentially up to a total dose of ~ 5 displacements per atom (dpa). These simulations are comparable to experiments conducted at cryogenic temperatures. Mixing is modeled using all three Cu-Nb potentials and found to be proportional to the square root of dose, independent of interface crystallography, and highly sensitive to liquid phase interdiffusivity. It occurs primarily by liquid phase interdiffusion in <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes</b> rather than by ballistic displacements. Partial de-mixing is also seen within <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes,</b> regardless of liquid phase solubility, which is explained by segregation of impurities into the liquid core of the <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes.</b> Additional MD and phase field simulations are carried out on Cu-Nb multilayered nanocomposites with individual layer thicknesses above 1 nm. These simulations demonstrate that Cu-Nb multilayers with individual layer thicknesses above 2 - 4 nm remain morphologically stable when subjected to 100 keV collision cascades, characteristic of neutron or heavy ion irradiation. The probability of morphological instability rapidly increases as the layer thickness decreases to 1 nm, {{which is due to}} overlap of zones of liquid-like interdiffusion inside radiation-induced <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes</b> at neighboring interfaces in the multilayer. This work shows that to design morphologically stable radiation-tolerant nanocomposites, it is desirable to a) choose low solubility metals with small liquid phase interdiffusivity as the constituents, and b) use a microstructural length scale larger than twice the size of the interdiffusion zone inside <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes.</b> by Liang Zhang.

50|$|The alpha-particles lose most {{of their}} energy to electrons, which manifests as heating the material. The heavier uranium nucleus has about 85 keV energy and about three {{quarters}} of it deposit as a cascade of atomic displacements; the uranium nucleus itself has the range of about 12 nanometers in the lattice. Each such decay event influences about 20,000 other atoms, 90% of which stay in their lattice site and only are thermally excited, the rest being displaced, resulting in formation of about 2500 Frenkel pairs and a local <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> lasting few picoseconds, during which the newly formed defects recombine or migrate. In a typical weapons-grade bulk material, each atom gets displaced in average once per 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} {{mechanism of}} physical sputtering is heat spike sputtering. This may {{occur when the}} solid is dense enough, and then the incoming ion heavy enough, that the collisions occur very close to each other. Then the binary collision approximation is no longer valid, but rather the collisional process should {{be understood as a}} many-body process. The dense collisions induce a heat spike (also called <b>thermal</b> <b>spike),</b> which essentially melts the crystal locally. If the molten zone is close enough to a surface, large numbers of atoms may sputter due to flow of liquid to the surface and/or microexplosions. Heat spike sputtering is most important for heavy ions (say Xe or Au or cluster ions) with energies in the keV-MeV range bombarding dense but soft metals with a low melting point (Ag, Au, Pb, etc.). The heat spike sputtering often increases nonlinearly with energy, and can for small cluster ions lead to dramatic sputtering yields per cluster of the order of 10,000. For animations of such a process see [...] "Re: Displacement Cascade 1" [...] in the external links section.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{kinetic energy}} of the atoms {{in the region of}} dense {{collisions}} is recalculated into temperature (using the basic equation E = 3/2·N·kBT), one finds that the kinetic energy in units of temperature is initially of the order of 10,000 K. Because of this, the region can be considered to be very hot, and is therefore called a heat spike or <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> (the two terms are usually considered to be equivalent). The heat spike cools down to the ambient temperature in 1-100 ps, so the [...] "temperature" [...] here does not correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium temperature. However, {{it has been shown that}} after about 3 lattice vibrations, the kinetic energy distribution of the atoms in a heat spike has the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, making the use of the concept of temperature somewhat justified. Moreover, experiments have shown that a heat spike can induce a phase transition which is known to require a very high temperature, showing that the concept of a (non-equilibrium) temperature is indeed useful in describing collision cascades.|$|E

50|$|A {{different}} model {{called the}} displacement spike was proposed for fast neutron bombardment of heavy elements. With high energy PKAs, the region affected is heated to temperatures above the material’s melting point, {{and instead of}} considering individual collisions, the entire volume affected could be considered to “melt” {{for a short period}} of time. The words “melt” and “liquid” are used loosely here because it is not clear whether the material at such high temperatures and pressures would be a liquid or a dense gas. Upon melting, former interstitials and vacancies become “density fluctuations,” since the surrounding lattice points no longer exist in liquid. In the case of a <b>thermal</b> <b>spike,</b> the temperature is not high enough to maintain the liquid state long enough for density fluctuations to relax and interatomic exchange to occur. A rapid “quenching” effect results in vacancy-interstitial pairs that persist throughout melting and resolidification. Towards the end of the path of a PKA, the rate of energy loss becomes high enough to heat up the material well above its melting point. While the material is melted, atomic interchange occurs as a result of random motion of the atoms initiated by the relaxation of local strains from the density fluctuations. This releases stored energy from these strains that raises the temperature even higher, maintaining the liquid state briefly after most of the density fluctuations disappear. During this time, the turbulent motions continue so that upon resolidification, most of the atoms will occupy new lattice sites. Such regions are called displacement spikes, which, unlike thermal spikes, do not retain Frenkel defects.|$|E
40|$|We present tight-binding {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{of the structural}} modifications that result from the "thermal spike" that occurs during {{the passage of a}} heavy fast ion through a thin diamond or amorphous carbon layer, and the subsequent regrowth upon cooling. The <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> and cooling down are simulated by locally heating and then quenching a small region of carbon, surrounded either by diamond or by a mostly three-fold bonded amorphous carbon network. For the case of the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> in diamond we find that if the ``temperature'' (kinetic energy of the atoms) {{at the center of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> is high enough, an amorphous carbon region containing a large fraction of threefold coordinated C atoms (two-fold bonded) remains within the diamond network after cooling. The structure of this amorphous layer depends very strongly on the ``temperature'' of heating and on the dimensions of the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike.</b> Scaling is found between curves of the dependence of the percentage of two-fold bonded atoms in the region of the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> on the heating ``temperature'' for different volumes.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> on a moisture-saturated graphite/epoxy composite was studied in detail. A single <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> from 25 to 132 C was found to produce damage, as evidenced by {{a significant increase in}} the level of moisture saturation in the composite. Approximately half of this increase remained after a vacuum-anneal at 150 C for seven days, suggesting the presence of an irreversible damage component. Subsequent thermal spikes created less and less additional moisture absorption, with the cumulative effect being a maximum or limiting moisture capacity of the composite. These observations are explained in terms of a model previously developed to explain the reverse thermal effect of moisture absorption in epoxy and epoxy-matrix composites.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{have been}} used to study the driving force of ion irradiation induced interfacial mixing in metal bilayers in which the relative mass of the constituents is considerable. We find no apparent effect of chemical forces, such as heat of mixing or cohesive energy up to 8 keV ion energy, although a considerable number of liquid and high energy particles (hot atoms) persist up to even 20 ps during the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike.</b> This result is in direct conflict with the widely accepted theory of <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> mixing (chemical interdiffusion model). The supersaturation of vacancies also occurs and which induces a thermally activated intermixing of the lighter constituent of the bilayer. The delay and the decoupling of the intermixing of the light constituent is explained as a backscattering effect at the interface: the interface acts as a diffusional barrier for high energy particles due to the large difference in atomic masses. The heavier atoms are predominantly ejected to the overlayer {{at the beginning of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> while the light atoms are injected to the bulk at the beginning of the cooling period (in Ti/Pt) or during the <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> with some time delay (Al/Pt).

40|$|We {{report and}} provide {{justification}} for the consistently observed four experimental facts of the mass spectrometric data of carbon cluster emission from the low-energy Cs irradiated single-walled carbon nanotubes. Firstly, the diatomic carbon C(2) is the most abundant sputtered species for Cs+ in the energy range 0. 2 keV to 2. 0 keV. Secondly, monatomic carbon C(1) is emitted with the least sputtering yield. Thirdly, at low cesium energies i the emitted species are C(2), C(3) and C(4). Lastly, as the irradiating Cs+ energy increases, the normalized yield of atomic carbon monotonically increases while clusters show gradual decrease and saturation. Sputtering of clusters is proved here {{to be due to}} <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes.</b> Binary collision cascade theory does not explain cluster sputtering. A statistical thermal model is developed to explain the experimentally observed data. The probability of a cluster C(x) to be emitted is shown to be proportional to that for the creation of an x-member vacancy with formation energy E at temperature T as {exp(E/kT) + 1 }^(- 1). The energies of formation of single and double vacancies from DFT calculations and the ratio of normalized experimental yields have been used to estimate spike temperature. We show that by invoking <b>thermal</b> <b>spikes,</b> cluster emission from, and the multiple vacancy generation in, the Cs+-irradiated SWCNTs can be explained.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{implementing the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> model for sputtering by energetic particle bombardment are performed for a gold target represented with a many-body embedded atom method (EAM) potential. A linear dependence of sputtering yield on the effective energy deposition is observed over {{a broad range}} of sufficiently high excitation energies, suggesting that the conclusions of earlier simulations performed with pair potentials have a general character and are not sensitive to the choice of interatomic potential. At the same time, significant differences in cluster ejection are observed between the simulations performed with EAM and pair potentials. Clusters constitute a much larger fraction of the total yield in the EAM simulations, which is related to the environmental dependence of the interatomic interaction in metals that is correctly reproduced by EAM potential. An apparent disagreement between the analytical <b>thermal</b> <b>spike</b> model and its implementation in MD simulations cannot be attributed to the choice of interatomic potential but reflects a difference in the ejection mechanisms.
