40|$|A {{relation}} between the Hamming weight enumerator of a linear code and the Tutte polynomial of the corresponding matroid has been known since long ago. It provides a simple proof of the MacWilliams equation (see D. Welsh, Matroid Theory (1976)). In this paper we prove analogous results for <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> distributions of a code. Keywords: Support weight distributions, Tutte polynomial, Mac-Williams equation. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A stereo {{matching}} algorithm with support regions based on {{color and texture}} estimate is proposed. Firstly, the initial support regions are selected from the image according to {{the distribution of the}} quantized color labels. Then, the texture similarity is used to determine the arm length growing and combine adjacent regions. The accurate support regions are obtained. Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> is introduced under the constraint of support region. Finally, the initial disparity can be corrected by using disparity adjustment method until a reasonable disparity map is obtained. The experimental results show that the good disparity result can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{projective}} multiset is {{a collection}} of projective points, which are not necessarily distinct. A linear code can be represented as a projective multiset, by taking the columns of a generator matrix as projective points. Projective multisets have proved very powerful in the study of generalised Hamming weights. In this paper we study relations between a code and its dual using the projective multisets, and we attack three dierent problems: the sub-chain conditions used by Chen and Klve [CK 97 a, CK 96, CK 99 b], the greedy weights from [CEZ 99, CK 01, CK 99 a], and <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> distributions, all of which are studied with respect to duality relations...|$|E

The software might not <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> for reasons of efficiency, simplicity, or because it was quicker to write <b>the</b> software without <b>supporting</b> <b>weights.</b> We discuss several techniques, both deterministic and random, for efficiently approximating the answer that would be obtained if <b>the</b> software <b>supported</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} the matroid structures corresponding to data-local and local maximally recoverable codes (MRC). The matroid structures of these codes {{can be used}} to determine the associated Tutte polynomial. Greene proved that the weight enumerators of any code can be determined from its associated Tutte polynomial. We will use this result to derive explicit expressions for the weight enumerators of data-local and local MRC. Also, Britz proved that <b>the</b> higher <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> of any code can be determined from its associated Tutte polynomial. We will use this result to derive expressions for <b>the</b> higher <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> of data-local and local MRC with two local codes. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{adapt to}} the trend of {{lightweight}} of vehicles, and optimize the structure of vehicle components, the former overturned support of a medium-duty truck cab was optimized by lightweight design. The 3 d model of the cabin former overturned support was firstly established, and then finite element analysis method was {{used to analyze the}} distributions of stress and displacement, with the support under extreme work conditions. And then a lightweight design was made basing on the analysis. The support blank is produced by permanent mold casting method. To meet the requirement of actual production, this paper, analyzed the casting defects of the structure by lightweight design, and then had a further modification basing on the actual casting technique. The results indicate that the weight of the cab support is reduced 23. 2 %, with lightweight design reducing <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> effectively under safety. And the modifications of the structure casting performance meet better the structural optimization objective, and make the production of the cab support more efficient...|$|E

40|$|Algorithms {{based on}} <b>the</b> {{adaptive}} <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> strategy currently represent the state-of-the-art in local stereo matching. Unfortunately, their good-quality results {{come at the}} price of high computation times: As opposed to standard local algorithms, incremental computation via sliding windows is not applicable for adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> windows. This paper presents a method for considerably speeding up computation times of these methods. The key idea is to exploit <b>the</b> adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> windows for generating an explicit over-segmentation of the reference image in a fast way. Having this explicit segmentation, we can take advantage of a modified “segmentation-based ” sliding window technique, which makes run time independent of the window size. In particular, we demonstrate our transformation scheme for the geodesic stereo matcher of [11] that has recently produced excellent results. Our unoptimized GPU-based implementation processes 320 × 240 pixel images with 26 allowed disparities at 10 frames per second and achieves rank 32 out of 74 methods in the Middlebury online benchmark. 1...|$|R
