40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to study the effect of spherical geometry on dynamic transitions and pattern formation for the Rayleigh-Benard convection. The study is mainly motivated by the importance of spherical geometry and convection in geophysical flows. It is shown in particular that the system always undergoes a continuous (Type-I) transition to a $ 2 l_c$-dimensional sphere $S^{ 2 lc}$, where lc is the critical wave length corresponding to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore, it has shown in [12] that it is critical to add nonisotropic <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> terms in the momentum equation to capture the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. We show in particular that the system with <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> terms added undergoes the same type of dynamic transition, and obtain an explicit formula linking the critical wave number (pattern selection), the aspect ratio, and the ratio between the horizontal and vertical <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients...|$|E

40|$|A new {{technology}} for reducing <b>turbulent</b> skin <b>friction,</b> called the Microblowing Technique (MBT), is presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The three-parameter {{hydraulic}} model of snow avalanche dynamics including the coefficients of dry and <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> and {{the coefficient of}} new-snow-mass entrainment was investigated. The ‘Domestic ’ avalanche site in Elbrus region, Caucasus, Russia, {{was chosen as the}} model avalanche range. According to the model, the fixed avalanche run-out can be achieved with various combinations of model parameters. At the fixed value of the coefficient of entrainment me, we have a curve on a plane of the coefficients of dry and <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction.</b> It was found that the family of curves (me is a parameter) are crossed at the single point. The value of the coefficient of <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> at the cross-point remained practically constant for the maximum and average avalanche run-outs. The conclusions obtained are confirmed by the results of modelling for six arbitrarily chosen avalanche sites: three in the Khibiny mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, two in the Elbrus region and one idealized site with an exponential longitudinal profile. The dependences of run-out on the coefficient of dry friction are constructed for all the investigated avalanche sites. The results are important for the statistical simulation of avalanche dynamics since they suggest the possibility of using only one random model parameter, namely, the coefficient of dry friction, in the model. The histograms and distribution functions of the coefficient of dry friction are constructed and presented for avalanche sites Nos 22 and 43 (Khibiny mountains) and ‘Domestic’, with the available series of field data...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{turbulent}} plane channel flow modified by a distributed transpiration at the wall, with zero net mass flux, is studied through {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) using the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The transpiration is steady, uniform in the spanwise direction, and varies sinusoidally along the streamwise coordinate. The transpiration wavelength is found to dramatically affect the turbulent flow, {{and in particular the}} frictional drag. Long wavelengths produce large drag increases even with relatively small transpiration intensities, thus providing an efficient means for improved turbulent mixing. Shorter wavelengths, on the other hand, yield an unexpected decrease of <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction.</b> These opposite effects are separated by a threshold of transpiration wavelength, shown to scale in viscous units, related to a longitudinal length scale typical of the near-wall turbulence cycle. Transpiration is shown to affect the flow via two distinct mechanisms: steady streaming and direct interaction with turbulence.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{across the}} critical depth in free-surface flows in- volves large streamline curvature, which increases as the flow depth deviates from the asymptotic normal depth. Consideration of the asymptotic {{behavior of a}} free-surface flow to the normal depth re- quires inclusion of <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction.</b> Potential flow methods {{for the analysis of}} near-critical flow are limited to short channel reaches (Fawer 1937; Castro-Orgaz 2010) for the energy grade line to be horizontal, yet in cases including the undular hydraulic jump, a potential flow solution does not exist (Mandrup Andersen 1978; Mandrup Anderson 1980; Montes 1979). The backwater ap- proach of gradually varied flows is known to break down at the critical depth (Montes 1998). Thus, a rapidly varied flow model allowing for <b>turbulent</b> <b>friction</b> is required to simultaneously treat the transition across the critical section and the asymptotic condi- tions at uniform flow.

40|$|Wall-bounded {{turbulent}} flows such as plane Couette flow, channel, pipe {{flows and}} boundary layer flows are fundamental problem {{of interest that}} we often meet in many scientific and engineering situations. The goal of the present thesis is to investigate the origin of large-scale streaky motions observed in the wall-bounded turbulent flows. Under a hypothesis that the large-scale streaky motions sustain with a process similar to the well-known near-wall self-sustaining cycle, the present thesis have pursued on four separate subjects: (i) non-modal amplification of streaks, (ii) the secondary instability of the finite amplitude streaks, (iii) existence of a self-sustaining process at large scale and (iv) <b>turbulent</b> skin <b>friction</b> reduction by forcing streaks. First, using a linear model with turbulent mean flow and the related eddy viscosity, it is shown that the streaks are largely amplified by harmonic and stochastic forcing. The largely amplified streaks undergo the secondary instability {{and it has been}} associated with the formation of the large-scale motions (bulge). The existence of a self-sustaining process involving the amplification and instability of streaks at large scale is proved by quenching the smaller-scale energy carrying eddies in the near-wall and logarithmic regions. Finally, it is shown that artificially forcing of large-scale streaks reduce the <b>turbulent</b> skin <b>friction</b> up to 10 % by attenuating the near-wall streamwise vortices...|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made of two-dimensional turbulent boundary-layer flow with zero pressure gradient. The investigation was made to determine the accuracy of a method proposed by Preston for measuring the local <b>turbulent</b> skin <b>friction.</b> The general momentum equation was used in conjunction with measurements of skill friction by Preston's method, to obtain increments in momentum thickness which could be compared with the measured values. The experiments were made on a smooth flat plate, 6 It long, which spanned the working-section of a return-circuit wind tunnel. Transition was promoted by trip wires and glass-paper strips. A constant Reynolds number of 3. 9 X 10 5 per foot was maintained throughout the experiments. The results, together with certain basic arguments, indicate that Preston's method will give the correct skin friction. For the range of Reynolds numbers covered in the experiments (1500 < Ro < 4000) the skin-friction coefficients obtained for different values of Ro (the Reynolds number based on momentum thickness), were approximately 10 per cent and 6 per cent less than the corresponding Prandtl-Schlichting and Schoenherr values respectively. 1.
