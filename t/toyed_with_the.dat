5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E
5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends. Although this {{would later become}} the inspiration for Fark, Curtis <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of starting an online curry recipe database. In 1999, eighteen months after registering the domain name, he launched Fark {{as a way to}} share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails. The first story posted was an article about a fighter pilot who crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot.|$|E

5|$|Knox {{had avoided}} being arrested by Lord Bothwell through Wishart's advice {{to return to}} tutoring. He took shelter with Douglas in Longniddry. Several months later {{he was still in}} charge of the pupils, the sons of Douglas and Cockburn, who wearied of moving from place to place while being pursued. He <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of fleeing to Germany and taking his pupils with him. While Knox {{remained}} a fugitive, Beaton was murdered on 29 May 1546, within his residence, the Castle of St Andrews, by a gang of five persons in revenge for Wishart's execution. The assassins seized the castle and eventually their families and friends took refuge with them, about a hundred and fifty men in all. Among their friends was Henry Balnaves, a former secretary of state in the government, who negotiated with England for the financial support of the rebels. Douglas and Cockburn suggested to Knox to take their sons to the relative safety of the castle to continue their instruction in reformed doctrine. Knox arrived at the castle on 10 April 1547.|$|E

50|$|By March 2009, {{the only}} {{remaining}} members of Candiria were John LaMacchia and Carley Coma; Coma had stated that any future Candiria efforts {{will most likely be}} electronica-based projects as they are without a rhythm section, however, by mid-2009, Mike MacIvor had returned to the band. In August 2009, <b>the</b> band released <b>Toying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Insanities Volume I on gatefold CD, followed by <b>Toying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Insanities Volume II in September 2009.

25|$|During pre-production, Eiji Tsuburaya had <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea {{of using}} Willis O'Brien's stop-motion {{technique}} instead of the suitmation process used {{in the first two}} Godzilla films, but budgetary concerns prevented him from using the process, and the more cost efficient suitmation was used instead. However, some brief stop motion was used in a couple of quick sequences. One of these sequences was animated by Koichi Takano {{who was a member of}} Eiji Tsuburaya's crew.|$|E
25|$|Shidibala's {{powerful}} grandmother Dagi installed Shidibala as Crown Prince in 1316, {{and then}} as Khan, since he was mothered by a Khunggirad khatun.

25|$|Offers {{continued}} to come in, and in 1962, producer Ross Hunter proposed teaming MacDonald and Eddy for featured roles in his 1963 comedy smash, The Thrill of It All. They declined and the roles were eventually played by Arlene Francis and Edward Andrews. 20th Century Fox also <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of MacDonald (Irene Dunne was also briefly considered) {{for the part}} of Mother Abbess in {{the film version of}} The Sound of Music. It never moved beyond the discussion stages partly because of MacDonald's failing health.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concept of using {{specialised}} Vietnamese language {{skills as a}} means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it. The presence of three Vietnamese language specialists at Yen Bai had been unable to stopt the mutiny; the persistent anti-colonial penetration of the civil administration had occurred despite its many specialists. Furthermore, the experience of Roman Catholic missionaries indicated that language specialisation was becoming increasingly ineffective in countering the trend towards more secretive and effective anti-colonial organisation. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all that one would need.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} St. Mary's in May 1930, Lady Bird <b>toyed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of going}} back to Alabama. Another friend from Marshall was going to the University of Texas, so she {{chartered}} a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly {{fell in love with the}} city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, such as Orange Jackets, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.|$|E
