25|$|In the character's backstory, Fraser raised Grace and Clare as {{a single}} parent. He put his efforts into raising Clare, believing Grace was adept to look after herself. Their mother had walked out on them to escape Fraser's {{criminal}} life and started a new family. Fraser also raised Trevor but he had become romantically involved with Clare and got her pregnant. Grace secretly had feelings for Trevor too. Grace and Clare did not get along with each other. When Clare died it made Grace reflect on the relationship and realise she loved her sister. But Grace is upset that she never <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> she felt. This is the main motive Grace has in wanting revenge against her killer.|$|E
500|$|She got {{in touch}} with book {{publisher}} Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving a draft of the work. In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Donovan {{commented that}} Scott loved Charlene, {{so when he}} saw she was in danger, he forgot to think about himself and he just went in to rescue her. Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they loved each other and {{were not going to}} break up again. Minogue agreed with Donovan, saying [...] "There is that underlying love whether they are together or not." [...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become. When Charlene showed the ring to Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> she and Scott wanted to live together, Daphne was taken back. Scott's friend Mike Young (Guy Pearce) also voiced his opposition, but Scott was determined that no one would stop them from moving in together. Bourne noted that Daphne's shock at the couple's plans was [...] "the start of a major controversy, splitting apart the inhabitants of Ramsay Street." ...|$|E
60|$|Edmonds <b>told</b> <b>her</b> exactly <b>how</b> much, {{and then}} started in sudden consternation with rage in his heart, for she turned to Hawtrey imperiously.|$|R
60|$|The child {{thought of}} what the {{schoolmaster}} had <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> and felt <b>how</b> its truth was shadowed out even in this infant.|$|R
60|$|His {{emphasis}} of the pronoun was very eloquent. Not in all {{the words of the}} French language could he have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> better <b>how</b> high he placed her in his thoughts, how utterly she must fall, how unutterably be soiled by an alliance with Tressan.|$|R
500|$|Pressured {{again by}} Manningham and Douglas (it was the latter {{who took her}} confession), she made a further {{admission}} on 8December and another on 9December, before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell, charged on a statute of Edward III as a [...] "vile cheat and imposter". [...] In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair {{on a range of}} other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. [...] She also claimed that a travelling woman <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would [...] "never want as long as I liv'd". [...] The British Journal reported that on 7January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged [...] "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". [...] Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. [...] Mist's Weekly Journal of 24December 1726 reported that [...] "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others." ...|$|E
2500|$|French {{has claimed}} that her {{self-confidence}} and self-belief stem from her father, who <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> beautiful she was each day. She stated, [...] "He {{taught me to}} value myself. He told me that I was beautiful and the most precious thing in his life." [...] He {{had a history of}} severe depression and attempted suicides but managed to conceal his illness from Dawn and her brother.|$|E
60|$|Then King Arthur {{told the}} Queen his sister {{all that had}} befallen. For he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> that Gareth had come thither and in what guise; and he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> Gareth had dwelt all that year unknown at the court {{under the name of}} Beaumains because of the {{whiteness}} of his hands; and he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> that Beaumains had gone forth upon that adventure to the Castle Dangerous; and he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> he had succeeded in that adventure; and he told her of the several other things that are herein told, and ever Queen Margaise listened to him.|$|E
60|$|The princess sighed deeply, {{and at last}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>how,</b> {{during the}} night, the bed had been carried into some strange house, and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least, but bade her rise and {{consider}} it an idle dream.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> briefly, <b>how</b> he {{had come}} out with his mother; and how, finding war had broken out, he had joined the army; and how, {{at the end of}} the war, having been able to learn nothing about his father, {{he had come}} up with Surajah to search for him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{may make}} Darpent deserve a fresh creation, then,' he answered, smiling sadly. 'It will {{be best to}} wait a little, as I have <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> to see <b>how</b> matters turn out at home.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> he {{had been}} greatly honoured of the King of England, and of the battles he had fought in at his side. Lastly, Eric <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> the King would have given him a certain great lady of royal blood in marriage, and how Edmund had been angered because he would not stay in England.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> {{he had set}} {{his heart}} on finding the king's daughter.|$|E
6000|$|And I have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> {{beautiful}} {{you are in}} {{your age}} and how bright your mind is with its old-time brightness, and how she and the children would enjoy you. And I have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> singularly young Pamela is looking, and what a fine large fellow Sam is, and how ill the lingering syllable [...] "my" [...] to his name fits his port and figure.|$|E
25|$|Laura Joplin, Janis' younger sister, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that her sister went straight to her parents' home in Port Arthur, Texas, following Woodstock, was incredibly vibrant and happy after coming home, and really loved the festival. Joplin <b>told</b> <b>her</b> family <b>how</b> great it was, but her mother and father remained distant on the subject as they did not really understand the hippie movement.|$|R
60|$|She praised 'im {{all the way}} 'ome, and if it 'adn't {{been for}} his mouth and nose George would 'ave enjoyed it more than 'e did. She <b>told</b> <b>'er</b> mother <b>how</b> 'e had flown at a big man wot 'ad insulted her, and Mrs. Mitchell shook her 'ead at 'im and said his bold spirit would lead 'im into trouble afore he 'ad done.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} the giant would not hear of it, {{but in the end}} he gave in, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> exactly <b>how</b> it must all be done. She was to kill the lion herself and cut him up very small; then she must burn him, and cast his ashes into the water, and out of the water the prince would come free from enchantment for ever.|$|R
60|$|And they <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> {{their lives}} had been spent in being hurried from one prison-castle to another.|$|E
60|$|Harry then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> {{completely}} he {{had failed}} with the sailors, and how an actual feeling of hostility against him had arisen.|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how,</b> {{when they}} were perfect strangers, Griffiths had nursed him through an illness; and in the telling Griffiths' {{self-sacrifice}} lost nothing.|$|E
6000|$|She came; she lodged. Wherever she rambled [...] They {{held her}} as no other than The lady named; and <b>told</b> <b>how</b> <b>her</b> husband [...] Had died a forsaken man.|$|R
60|$|The lady smiled sadly at Margaret's vehemence, but sighed {{the next}} moment, while she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> young friend <b>how</b> little {{she knew the}} world {{she was about to}} live in, since she testified so much {{surprise}} at finding it full of villainy.|$|R
60|$|Anne <b>told</b> him <b>how</b> <b>her</b> {{inquiries}} {{had been}} made and what the result had been, plainly and frankly. The clouded face of Bishopriggs began to clear again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{with the}} bishop's good-will, {{you may be}} sure, Mary," [...] Terence laughed; and he then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> he had become possessed of it.|$|E
6000|$|His father said: [...] "No. Hasn't he come in yet?" [...] and he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> he {{had been}} looking everywhere, and she burst out crying.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the crowd}} cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten {{in her arms}} and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> delighted she was to know that she was innocent.|$|E
6000|$|He found Elizabeth in the school-room, all {{flushed and}} tear-stained in the face; and he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> affectionately <b>how</b> much pleased {{he was with}} her {{patience}} under this false accusation. Delight very nearly set her off crying again, but she managed to say, [...] "It was Miss Fosbrook and Sam and Susie that made me patient, Papa; they were so kind. And nobody would have believed it, if I wasn't always cross, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Aladdin {{went back}} to the Princess, saying his head ached, and {{requesting}} that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger, pierced him to the heart. [...] "What have you done?" [...] cried the Princess. [...] "You have killed the holy woman!" [...] "Not so," [...] replied Aladdin, [...] "but a wicked magician," [...] and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of <b>how</b> she had been deceived.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor girl}} felt it all {{as if it}} had been Gospel truth. Her brother writing in the {{fullness}} of his simple heart, had often <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so, and <b>how</b> much more! As Mr Pecksniff ceased to speak, she hung her head, and dropped a tear upon his hand.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>how</b> he pin'd: and, ah! [...] The low, the deep, the {{pleading}} tone, [...] With which I sang another's Love, [...] Interpreted my own.|$|E
60|$|The Sam Clarks {{called that}} evening and {{encouraged}} her to describe the missions. A dozen times they <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> glad they were to have her back.|$|E
60|$|And {{there was}} fear, horror in his voice. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>how</b> {{the men had}} carried his wife there--a long journey over the hill-tracks, almost two hours.|$|E
60|$|It is {{also the}} custom, when a {{prisoner}} has thus been given to one who begged for his life, that the captive shall always be held as slave by her; but Pocahontas desired only {{to let him go}} back to Jamestown. Then it was she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> father <b>how</b> she had been treated when visiting us, and Powhatan, after keeping Captain Smith prisoner until he could tell of what he had seen in other countries of the world, set him free.|$|R
5000|$|She did {{a special}} episode of Lo que callamos las mujeres called [...] "Las alas de mi alma" [...] (the wings of my soul) where she <b>told</b> <b>her</b> story of <b>how</b> {{she got into}} La Academia". On June 12, 2009, Ma. Ines made her 2nd {{appearance}} on Lo que callamos las mujeres.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is too bad of me, sir, and you--and a young gentlemen, too--if {{you will}} pardon me saying it, {{going to live}} there all alone. If you were my boy--and you'll excuse me for saying it--you wouldn't sleep there a night, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell that's on the roof!' The good {{creature}} was so manifestly in earnest, and was so kindly in her intentions, that Malcolmson, although amused, was touched. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> kindly <b>how</b> much he appreciated her interest in him, and added: ...|$|R
