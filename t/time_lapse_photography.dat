500|$|Digital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each {{worked on}} {{separate}} shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared {{some of their}} files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that [...] "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." [...] The artists studied <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>photography</b> of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for {{the effect of the}} glowing Extremis characters.|$|E

50|$|Numerically large Focal ratios {{are said}} to be long or slow. Small numbers are short or fast. There are no sharp lines for {{determining}} when to use these terms, an individual may consider their own standards of determination. Among contemporary astronomical telescopes, any telescope with a focal ratio slower (bigger number) than f/12 is generally considered slow, and any telescope with a focal ratio faster (smaller number) than f/6, is considered fast. Faster systems often have more optical aberrations away {{from the center of the}} field of view and are generally more demanding of eyepiece designs than slower ones. A fast system is often desired for practical purposes in astrophotography with the purpose of gathering more photons in a given time period than a slower system, allowing <b>time</b> <b>lapsed</b> <b>photography</b> to process the result faster.|$|R
40|$|The SO 15 {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} extend observations {{of the effects of}} zero-gravity to living human cells during and subsequent to a 59 -day flight on Skylab 3. A strain of diploid human embryonic lung cells, WI- 38, was chosen for this purpose. The studies were concerned with observations designed to detect the effects of zero-gravity on cell growth rates and on cell structure as observed by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and histochemistry. Studies of the effects of zero-gravity on the cell function and the cell cycle were performed by <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> motion picture <b>photography</b> and microspectrophotometry. Subsequent study of the returned living cells included karotyping, G- and C-banding, and analyses of the culture media used. Some of the living cells returned were banked by deep freeze techniques for possible future experiments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} and tests a photography rig {{that has been}} built at the University of Melbourne, Australia, specifically {{for the purpose of}} taking rapid and highly standardized craniofacial photographs, in simultaneous views of front and profile. The rig uses a novel projected light range-finding system that has been designed for easy and accurate positioning of subjects, in the natural head position, at precise distances from the frontal camera. Results of experiments examining the intraobserver error of multiple photographs taken on the rig indicate that high-quality, repeatable photographs can be taken after a reasonably large amount of <b>time</b> has <b>lapsed</b> between <b>photography</b> sessions (e. g., 30 days). This study also indicates that some variability remains between photographs even when highly standardized protocols are followed. Consequently, it is expected that the variation between photographs with limited standardization is much larger and more likely to cause significant errors in any comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity to ozone of pollen germinating {{in vitro}} is closely {{correlated}} with ozone {{sensitivity of the}} pollen parent. Ozone-sensitive and tolerant pollen populations {{have been identified in}} tobacco, petunia, and tomato cultivars. The rate of tube elongation can be reversibly slowed or stopped by exposure to low concentrations of ozone. Tube growth rates {{in the presence of a}} range of ozone dosages, of pollen populations exhibiting differing ozone sensitivity can be measured and different growth rates can be correlated with ozone dosages. The performance of selected pollen populations can then be used to bioassay ozone in ambient air by introducing the air sample into a growth chamber where ozone-sensitive pollen in growing. Petunia and tobacco pollen are especially useful because they store well at ordinary freezer temperatures and do not require special preparation prior to storage. Modified Brewbacker's growth medium is suitable for growth of both these pollen types. Four useful cultivars are Bel W- 3, ozone-sensitive and Bel B, ozone-tolerant tobacco, and White Bountiful, ozone-sensitive and Blue Lagoon, ozone-tolerant petunia. Observations can be made directly by using a TV scanner, or by <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> or interval <b>photography.</b> Year-round pollen production can be achieved in the greenhouse. Harvested pollen can be tested, packaged, and transported to use...|$|R

40|$|Most {{of video}} {{recording}} posses the redundant information {{which does not}} require to be recorded, actual information to be record is very less as compared to information present in normal video. A differential time-lapse technique allows us to remove the unnecessary data from the normal video, {{in order to save}} the time to visualization and storage space. Differential <b>Time</b> <b>Lapse</b> Video is non-periodic <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> technique. In differential <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> video, each frame are compared with previously last stored frame, If some information/movement is found in the frame than frame is stored and considered as last stored frame, else frame is discarded. The differential <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> video can be generated by pixel-to-pixel bit mapping technique, motion detection technique, edge comparison technique etc. In this paper we implement the motion detection criterion as frame selection criterion to generate differential <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> video in real time application. The analysis of moving objects is done by detection of variations in intensity over time in the environment Here we are concerned with determinist modeling that is images difference, to detect the moving objects masks.

40|$|Background/Aims: Specific {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis C {{is effective in}} 50 % of patients, improving the]liver`s fibrosis, necroinflammatory changes and steatosis. However, in patients still viremic after treatment the extension of these benefits remains doubtful. The evolution of the disease in this group {{and its relationship to}} demographic data, biometric indices and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies was evaluated. Methodology: In 141 patients, paired biopsies were classified and compared according to fibrosis grading. Necroinflammation, steatosis, demographic data (age and gender), body mass index (BMI) and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies were compared with fibrosis grading. Results: The grade of fibrosis of the patients, after approximately 3. 5 years <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies, could be classified into 4 groups; Improved: 29 (20. 0 %), Unaltered: 64 (45. 0 %), Worsened: 48 (34 %) and Cirrhotic: 14 (9. 93 %). For necroinflammation, the Improved/Unaltered groups were statistically similar but different from the Worsened and Cirrhotic. The mean age, BMI and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies were statistically similar in all groups. Steatosis occurred in 35 (24. 82 %) between biopsies and its incidence was reduced in the Worsened and Cirrhotic groups. Conclusions: Fibrosis turned into cirrhosis in a significant number of patients, after a short <b>time</b> <b>lapse.</b> The reverse correlation of steatosis to fibrosis and its occurrence during the <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies suggests it might induce hepatic necrosis and contribute to fibrogenesis...|$|R
