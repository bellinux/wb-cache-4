5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning was {{accomplished}} by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaur genomes. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs {{at the idea of}} such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>with</b> Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>with</b> his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert {{from him and}} tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E

The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>with</b> his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area and walked into the ride's path. Although witnesses stated he was trying to retrieve his hat, a Cobb County police spokesman reported the teens were attempting to take a shortcut into the park.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} {{roller coaster}} being built at Six Flags Magic Mountain first emerged {{in the summer of}} 2004.

Construction permits filed by Six Flags Magic Mountain and a trademark for the name Tatsu (filed on August 23, 2005) were later found by the public.

After construction and testing was complete, Tatsu opened to the public on May 13, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The gardens at West Wycombe Park {{are among}} the finest and most {{idiosyncratic}} 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was Nicholas Revett, who designed many of the ornamental buildings in the park. The landscape architect Thomas Cook began to execute the plans for <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>with</b> a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby River Wye {{in the form of}} a swan. The lake originally had a snow (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a cascade and into a canal pond.|$|E

The video ends with them continuing dancing and Madonna carrying away the casket.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen-year-old Sarah Williams rehearses a play in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>with</b> her dog Merlin but becomes {{distracted by}} a line she {{is unable to}} {{remember}} while being watched by a barn owl. Realizing she is late to babysit her baby brother Toby, she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother Irene before {{she and her father}} Robert leave for dinner. Sarah has many toys that she has grown out of and realizes that Toby is in possession of her treasured teddy bear Lancelot. Frustrated by this and his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes Toby be taken away by the Goblin King Jareth, a character in the play she is rehearsing. She is shocked when Toby disappears and the Goblin King confronts her and transports her to his kingdom. He refuses to return the baby but gives Sarah thirteen hours to solve his labyrinth and find him before Toby is turned into a goblin forever. Sarah meets a dwarfish man named Hoggle, who aids her in entering the Labyrinth. She has trouble finding turns and corners but then meets a talking worm who inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|In about 1879–81 Douglas built {{a terrace}} of houses {{on his own}} land in Chester, 6–11 Grosvenor Park Road, the road leading to the main {{entrance}} to Grosvenor Park, in High Victorian style. About 1883 he designed Barrowmore Hall (or Barrow Court) at Great Barrow (since demolished) {{which was one of}} his largest houses. Also around this time he designed buildings on the Eaton Hall estate, including Eccleston Hill (1881–82), a large house for the Duke's secretary, the Stud Lodge, a smaller building of the same dates, Eccleston Hill Lodge (1881), a three-storey gatehouse at the main entrance to <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>with</b> a high hipped roof and turrets, and The Paddocks (1882–83), another large house, this time for the Duke's land agent. In Chester city centre his designs included the Grosvenor Club and North and South Wales Bank (1881–83) in Eastgate Street, built in stone and brick, with a turret and a stepped gable, and 142 Foregate Street for the Cheshire County Constabulary (1884), with a shaped gable in Flemish style.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move in and out of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>with</b> relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
