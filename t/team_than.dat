The deal likely {{involved}} Stivetts and Tucker, two players involved in Boston's religious quarrel {{from the previous}} season. As the season progressed, the press noted that his season had begun better than the previous season. Stivetts claimed {{that it was his}} weight loss (now just over 200lbs), that was the main reason why he had been more of an asset to the <b>team</b> <b>than</b> in past years.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production <b>team</b> <b>than</b> Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better <b>team</b> <b>than</b> the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the interplay of}} individualism-collectivism and team composition in team cohesion. I propose that individualism generates greater cohesion in diverse <b>teams</b> <b>than</b> does collectivism, whereas collectivism generates greater cohesion in homogeneous <b>teams</b> <b>than</b> does individualism. The underlying reasoning is that team composition is a cue that provides verification of one’s self-construal, ingroup-construal, and diversity beliefs, and that such verification fosters cohesion in work teams. Two experimental studies that manipulate psychological states representing individualism-collectivism provide evidence for the proposition. Study 1 manipulated self-construal, with results showing that individualistic self-construal generates greater energetic feeling in diverse <b>teams</b> <b>than</b> does collectivistic self-construal, which in turn promotes cohesion. Study 2 manipulated ingroup-construal, with results showing that individuated ingroup-construal promotes greater cohesion in diverse <b>teams</b> <b>than</b> does depersonalized ingroup-construal. The results of Study 2 also reveal a mediating effect of diversity beliefs linking individuated ingroup-construal and cohesion in diverse teams. Theoretical and practical implications of such findings for teams and organizations are discussed. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{globalization}} and growing business trends, negotiation {{in the form}} of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a <b>team</b> <b>than</b> in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in a negotiation.|$|E

25|$|The 2012 Los Angeles Dodgers {{season was}} the 123rd for the {{franchise}} in Major League Baseball, and their 55th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962. It was a transitional {{year as the}} sale of the team from Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was not finalized until May 1. The new ownership group put their stamp on the team quickly by making a number of big trades and putting more money into the <b>team</b> <b>than</b> McCourt did.

25|$|The 2009 Detroit Lions {{season was}} the franchise’s eightieth season {{overall in the}} National Football League. It was the first season with the Lions for new head coach Jim Schwartz, {{and most of his}} new {{coaching}} staff. The Lions also introduced slightly new uniforms and logos. The Lions spent the whole season at the bottom of their division and finished at 2–14, the second-worst record during the 2009 season. Pro Football Reference has argued that, owing to a weaker programme featuring the NFC West and AFC North vis-à-vis their 2008 schedule against surprisingly strong NFC South and AFC South divisions, the 2009 Lions were actually a weaker <b>team</b> <b>than</b> the 0–16 2008 Lions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} stages of the season it was clear that Montoya and his car were finally adapted to one another. The Colombian has often {{attributed}} this to the greater effort made by the McLaren <b>team</b> <b>than</b> by Williams to tune the car to his driving style. In the last 7 grands prix Montoya finished, he scored 3 wins, 2 poles and 5 podiums, as well as setting a track record(fastest lap) of 1:24.770, which stands today still, at the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix. At the Brazilian GP, Montoya led home McLaren's first 1–2 result in years, ahead of newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso in third. It was his last finish of the year. In Japan he was forced off the track by Jacques Villeneuve on lap one, while in China a loose drain cover rose up and hit his car, damaging the engine. Overall, he finished the season in 4th position in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|One {{month after}} Mancini's departure, Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini, {{formerly}} of Málaga and Real Madrid, {{was hired as}} his replacement. As Mancini was criticised for aggravating both his players and his boardroom-level superiors, {{as well as for}} failing to give young players a chance, Pellegrini was considered a strong candidate with a history of successful outings in the Champions League. In contrast to the late transfer dealings the previous year, CEO Ferran Soriano and Director of Football Txiki Begiristain moved quickly, securing four new signings for their new manager effectively before the team even flew out for its first pre-season match. Major acquisitions for the 2013–14 season included Álvaro Negredo and Jesús Navas for approximately £16 million and £14.9 million, respectively, from Sevilla; Fernandinho for £34 million from Shakhtar Donetsk and Stevan Jovetić for £22 million from Fiorentina; Martín Demichelis was acquired much later in the transfer window to shore up a defence ridden with injuries. Demichelis, who had transferred from Atlético Madrid {{despite the fact that he}} had only signed for them from Málaga just one month before, was almost instantly injured before playing a single game. The most significant departure from City was striker Carlos Tevez to Juventus, though Gareth Barry was also allowed to move, joining Everton on a season-long loan. This latter move was met with uncertainty from the supporters, who reckoned Barry to have a larger importance to the <b>team</b> <b>than</b> was commonly appreciated.|$|E
