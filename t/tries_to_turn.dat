25|$|Slice of Life is an {{upcoming}} short film {{set in the}} fictional universe established by Blade Runner (1982), set in 2019, {{the same year as}} the events of Blade Runner. Made without the use of computer-generated imagery, the film was developed over the course of three years, directed by Luka Hrgović and written by Anton Svetić, with a budget of $30,000 to be raised of Kickstarter. When completed, the film is due to be approximately 25-30 minutes long. The film follows “low-life drug dealer who <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his life around, but finds himself at the mercy of fate when he encounters a cop with an agenda of his own”.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{new program}} director, Andy Travis, <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around {{struggling}} radio station WKRP by switching its format from dated easy listening music to rock and roll, despite the well-meaning {{efforts of the}} mostly incompetent staff: bumbling station manager Arthur Carlson, greasy sales manager Herb Tarlek, and clueless news director Les Nessman. To help bolster ratings, Travis hires a new disc jockey, New Orleans native Gordon Sims (Venus Flytrap); and allows spaced-out former major market DJ Dr. Johnny Fever, already doing mornings in the easy listening format as John Caravella, to be himself. Rounding out the cast are super receptionist Jennifer Marlowe and enthusiastic junior employee Bailey Quarters. Lurking {{in the background and}} making an occasional appearance is ruthless business tycoon Mrs. Carlson, the station's owner and the mother of Arthur Carlson.|$|E

When Lana proclaims that Archer is getting an erection (caused by picturing Malory being dead), Kremenski lets go of Malory in disgust, allowing Archer room to shoot him several times in his chest and once in the head, killing him.|$|E

2500|$|The problem {{persists}} {{in the same}} way when attempting to determine whether God is an eternal essence, or an existing being, neither of which are adequate, as traditional theology was well aware. When God is understood in this way, it becomes clear that not only is it impossible to argue for the [...] "existence" [...] of God, since God is beyond the distinction between essence and existence, but it is also foolish: one cannot deny that there is being, and thus there is a Power of Being. The question then becomes whether and in what way personal language about God and humanity's relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to [...] "theological theism", Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the [...] "divine-human encounter". Such is the theism of the encounter with the [...] "Wholly Other" [...] ("Das ganz Andere"), as in the work of Karl Barth and Rudolf Otto, and implies a personalism with regard to God's self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of Biblical Religion altogether and the concept of the [...] "Word of God", but can become falsified if the theologian <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being. In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.|$|E

A lull, and the wind is secret and prying with him; lifts and lets falls a rag; hides palpitating under another rag; runs nimbly through his hair and beard. Then, in a rush, it cruelly taunts him. Father, {{was that you}} calling me? Was it you, the voiceless and the dead? Was it you, thus buffeted as you lie here in a heap? Was it you, thus baptized unto Death, with these flying {{impurities}} now flung upon your face? Why not speak, Father? Soaking into this filthy ground as you lie here, is your own shape.

6000|$|Hence {{this sense}} has been strongest in saints {{of a very}} mystical sort; such as St. Francis who spoke of Sister Sparrow and Brother Wolf. Shaw adopted this crusade of cosmic pity but adopted it very much in his own style, severe, explanatory, and even unsympathetic. He had no affectionate impulse to say [...] "Brother Wolf"; at the best {{he would have said}} [...] "Citizen Wolf," [...] like a sound republican. In fact, he was full of healthy human {{compassion}} for the sufferings of animals; but in phraseology he loved to put the matter unemotionally and even harshly. I was once at a debating club at which Bernard Shaw said that he was not a humanitarian at all, but only an economist, that he merely hated to see life wasted by carelessness or cruelty. I felt inclined to get up and address to him the following lucid question: [...] "If when you spare a herring you are only being oikonomikal, for what oikos are you being nomikal?" [...] But in an average debating club I thought this question might not be quite clear; so I abandoned the idea. But certainly it is not plain for whom Bernard Shaw is economising if he rescues a rhinoceros from an early grave. But the truth is that Shaw only took this economic pose from his hatred of appearing sentimental. If Bernard Shaw killed a dragon and rescued a princess of romance, he would try to say [...] "I have saved a princess" [...] with exactly the same intonation as [...] "I have saved a shilling." [...] He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his own heroism into a sort of superhuman thrift. He would thoroughly sympathise with that passage in his favourite dramatic author in which the Button Moulder tells Peer Gynt that there is a sort of cosmic housekeeping; that God Himself is very economical, [...] "and that is why He is so well to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|I was {{listening}} to yarns in the smoking-compartment of the Pullman, {{all the way to}} Helena, and with very few exceptions, each had for its point, violent, brutal, and ruffianly murder--murder by fraud and the craft of the savage--murder unavenged by the law, or at the most by an outbreak of fresh lawlessness. At the end of each tale I was assured that the old days had passed away, and that these were anecdotes of five years' standing. One man in particular distinguished himself by holding up to admiration the exploits of some cowboys of his acquaintance, and their skill {{in the use of the}} revolver. Each tale of horror wound up with [...] "and that's the sort of man he was," [...] as who should say: [...] "Go and do likewise." [...] Remember that the shootings, the cuttings, and the stabbings were not the outcome of any species of legitimate warfare; the heroes were not forced to fight for their lives. Far from it. The brawls were bred by liquor in which they assisted--in saloons and gambling-hells they were wont to [...] "pull their guns" [...] on a man, and in the vast majority of cases without provocation. The tales sickened me, but taught one thing. A man who carries a pistol may be put down as a coward--a person to be shut out from every decent mess and club, and gathering of civilised folk. There is neither chivalry nor romance in the weapon, for all that American authors have seen fit to write. I would I could make you understand the full measure of contempt with which certain aspects of Western life have inspired me. Let us try a comparison. Sometimes it happens that a young, a very young, man, whose first dress-coat is yet glossy, gets slightly flushed at a dinner-party among his seniors. After the ladies are gone, he begins to talk. He talks, you will remember, as a [...] "man of the world" [...] and a person of varied experiences, an authority on all things human and divine. The grey heads of the elders bow assentingly to his wildest statement; some one <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the conversation when what the youngster conceives to be wit has offended a sensibility; and another deftly slides the decanters beyond him as they circle round the table. You know the feeling of discomfort--pity mingled with aversion--over the boy who is making an exhibition of himself. The same emotion came back to me, when an old man who ought to have known better appealed from time to time for admiration of his pitiful sentiments. It was right in his mind to insult, to maim, and to kill; right to evade the law where it was strong and to trample over it where it was weak; right to swindle in politics, to lie in affairs of State, and commit perjury in matters of municipal administration. The car was full of little children, utterly regardless of their parents, fretful, peevish, spoilt beyond anything I have ever seen in Anglo-India. They in time would grow up into men such as sat in the smoker, and had no regard for the law; men who would conduct papers siding with defiance of any and every law. But it's of no consequence, as Mr. Toots says.|$|E
