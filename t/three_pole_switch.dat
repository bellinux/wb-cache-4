40|$|The detail {{structure}} of energy output and the dynamic characteristics of electric spark discharge process {{have been studied}} to calculate the energy of electric spark induced plasma under different discharge condition accurately. A series of electric spark discharge experiments were conducted with the capacitor stored energy {{in the range of}} 10 J 100 J and 1000 J respectively. And the resistance of wire, switch and plasma between electrodes were evaluated by different methods. An optimized method for electric resistance evaluation of the full discharge circuit, <b>three</b> <b>poles</b> <b>switch</b> and electric spark induced plasma during the discharge process was put forward. The electric energy consumed by wire, electric switch and electric spark induced plasma between electrodes were obtained by Joules law. The {{structure of}} energy distribution and the dynamic process of energy release during the capacitor discharge process have been studied. Experiments results showed that, with the increase of capacitor released energy, the duration of discharge process becomes longer, and the energy of plasma accounts for more in the capacitor released energy. The dynamic resistance of plasma and <b>three</b> <b>poles</b> <b>switch</b> obtained by energy conversation law is more precise than that obtained by the parameters of electric current oscillation during the discharge process.

40|$|Economic and {{population}} growth as well as global macroeconomic policies are contributing to increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate change effects are more pronounced in cold regions such as the ‘Three Poles’ (the Arctic, the Antarctic and the Hindu Kush-Himalaya regions) than anywhere else. The <b>Three</b> <b>Poles</b> are rich in natural resources but the extraction of resources is degrading ecosystems and processes, and affecting species. In the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles,</b> many species depend on ice and snow habitats, but these species are competing with human activities for space and resources on a finite globe. Local and global pressures cause bird species populations to decline. In this study I investigated how bird populations are affected by economic growth and subsequent effects on the environment in the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles</b> regions. Data mining based on machine learning algorithms was used to perform the analyses. TreeNet (based on regression trees), included in the software Salford Predictive Modeler Builder® v. 6. 6 was used to develop the models. An additional Random Forests analysis (classification trees) was {{used to analyze the}} datasets. Two response variables were chosen based on bird distribution maps provided by BirdLife and the IUCN RedList categories, including those that have risk of extinction or are in the Least Concern category but with declining populations. Data from the WDI Data Catalog of The World Bank (World Development Indicators) were used as predictors. The results include a total of 24 models, classified by pole and type of country according to their direct (primary countries) or indirect (secondary countries) link to the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles</b> regions. A combind model was also run (primary and secondary countries). Models were evaluated according to the response curves and gains charts. Models confirm that global demand for, and consumtion of, resources is affecting the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles.</b> Food production, rural population, CO 2 emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and agricultural land were the top ranked predictors to explain the number of birds classified as threatened or with populations decreasing. This finding supports that the global demand for resources such as oil, gas and fish that were exploited from the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles,</b> added to global warming from anthropogenic causes are significantly affecting bird species populations. However, further research has to be carried out in order to obtain sound information on what the best management and governance is for a sustainable outlook for the <b>Three</b> <b>Poles</b> and beyond...|$|R
