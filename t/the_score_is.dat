As of the 2016 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>is</b> a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The 15 finals to-date have produced five drawn matches, the eventual winners {{of which have been}} determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976) or golden goal (1996, 2000).

5|$|The World Cup final {{match is}} the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is {{declared}} world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>is</b> a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>is</b> calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
