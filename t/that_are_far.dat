5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} indigenous skin pigmentation around the world.

25|$|Symbiosis is not {{the only}} method of {{reproduction}} in anglerfish. In fact, many families, including the Melanocetidae, Himantolophidae, Diceratiidae, and Gigantactinidae, show no evidence of male symbiosis. Females in some of these species contain large, developed ovaries and free-living males have large testes, suggesting these sexually mature individuals may spawn during a temporary sexual attachment that does not involve fusion of tissue. Males in these species also have well-toothed jaws <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> more effective in hunting than those seen in symbiotic species.|$|E

25|$|Genetic linkage is the {{tendency}} of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other {{are unlikely to be}} separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and {{the more likely they are}} to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets {{are those that}} can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot {{be divided into two}} pieces <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> apart. The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of open set, we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for open set is called a topology. A set with a topology is called a topological space.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most {{expensive}} city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, {{due to the}} stable Russian ruble as well as increasing housing prices within the city.

However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the {{most expensive}} city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place. Critics of their methodology argue that this survey replicates the lifestyle that a senior executive would have in Washington DC, counting certain very expensive brand name foreign goods, but disregarding the many lines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> cheaper in Russia, e.g. household staff, drivers, nannies, etc.|$|E

25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} is {{an expression}} of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the maximum entropy production principle. It states that non-equilibrium systems behave {{such a way as to}} maximize its entropy production.|$|E
25|$|As {{performance}} {{is part of}} the specification of a program – a program that is unusably slow is not fit for purpose: a video game with 60Hz (frames-per-second) is acceptable, but 6 frames-per-second is unacceptably choppy – {{performance is}} a consideration from the start, to ensure that the system is able to deliver sufficient performance, and early prototypes need to have roughly acceptable performance for there to be confidence that the final system will (with optimization) achieve acceptable performance. This is sometimes omitted in the belief that optimization can always be done later, resulting in prototype systems <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> too slow – often by an order of magnitude (factor of 10×) or more – and systems that ultimately are failures because they architecturally cannot achieve their performance goals, such as the Intel 432 (1981); or ones that take years of work to achieve acceptable performance, such as Java (1995), which only achieved acceptable performance with HotSpot (1999). The degree to which performance changes between prototype and production system, and how amenable it is to optimization, can be a significant source of uncertainty and risk.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR, generally located closer to the equator, tend to have darker-skinned populations. Areas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations. Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones, and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (≈2,500 years) through selective sweeps. Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells. In addition, it has been observed that adult human females on average are significantly lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.|$|E

25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau {{defines a}} work-life balance {{as a society}} in which an {{individual}} is not limited by his/her gender in choosing a fulfilling occupation that will accommodate each stage of an individual's life. Japanese workers on average have a minimum of ten work days for vacation time per year and are given zero paid public holidays, numbers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> below any other industrialized nation except the United States. In order to ensure that Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer flexible hours that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice work-life balance for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E
