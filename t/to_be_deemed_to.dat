25|$|Censure is {{an action}} by the House of Commons or the Senate rebuking the actions or conduct of an individual. The power to censure is not {{directly}} mentioned in the constitutional texts of Canada but {{is derived from the}} powers bestowed upon both Chambers through section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867. A motion of censure can be introduced by any Member of Parliament or Senator and passed by a simple majority for censure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> have been delivered. In addition, if the censure is related to the privileges of the Chamber, the individual in question could be summoned to the bar of the House or Senate (or, {{in the case of a}} sitting member, to that member's place in the chamber) to be censured, and could also face other sanctions from the house, including imprisonment. Normally, censure is exclusively an on-the-record rebuke — it is not equivalent to a motion of no confidence, and a prime minister can continue in office even if censured.|$|E

Justice Anthony Kennedy speculated in the 2000 case ofTroxel v. Granville that current Supreme Court doctrine prohibits the judiciary from using the Due Process Clause instead of an applicable specific constitutional provision if one is available.|$|E
60|$|Until {{the year}} 1868 it was left, embarrassed by {{conflicting}} opinions of courts and of jurists, {{to determine how}} far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance derived from our former colonial relations with Great Britain was applicable to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept these doubts away by enacting that--Any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officer of this Government which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this Government. But Congress did not indicate in that statute, nor has it since done so, what acts are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> work expatriation. For my own guidance in determining such questions I required (under {{the provisions of the}} Constitution) the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the Executive Departments upon certain questions relating to this subject. The result satisfies me that further legislation has become necessary. I therefore commend the subject to the careful consideration of Congress, and I transmit herewith copies of the several opinions of the principal officers of the Executive Departments, together with other correspondence and pertinent information on the same subject.|$|E

If the terms of service are not visible and/or accessible, courts have found the notice requirement to be lacking and as such, the purchaser may not be bound {{to the terms of}} the agreement.

5000|$|The word lady is a [...] term {{of respect}} for a woman, {{specifically}} the female equivalent to gentleman, and also an English-language formal title. [...] "Lady" [...] is used before the surname {{of a woman with}} a title of nobility or honorary title suo jure, or the wife of a lord, a baronet, and a knight, and also before the first name of the daughter of a Duke, Marquess, or Earl. Once used to describe only women of a high social class, race, community, and status; now the term is commonly used to refer to any respectable adult woman, or even any woman. However, from a conservative point of view this usage is still controversial, just as it is for all adult men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "gentlemen".|$|E

The House of Bryant, which owns the copyright to the song, as well as multiple trademarks and copyrights associated with it, has objected to the name change, asserting that it would violate intellectual property rights. [...] On May 29, U.S. District Judge Thomas A.

5000|$|These {{decisions}} {{also established}} that {{the question as to}} the proper construction of the bill of lading is a Federal question. The clause with respect to the notice of claims-upon which the plaintiff in error relies in its second contention-specifically covers 'failure to make delivery.' It is said that this is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>to</b> include a case where there was not only failure to deliver to the consignee, but actual delivery to another, or delivery in violation of instruction. But 'delivery' must mean delivery as required by the contract, and the terms of the stipulation are comprehensive,-fully adequate in their literal and natural meaning to cover all cases where the delivery has not been made as required. When the goods have been misdelivered there is as clearly a 'failure to make delivery' as when the goods have been lost or destroyed; and it is quite as competent in the one case as in the other for the parties to agree upon reasonable notice of the claim as a condition of liability. It may be urged that the carrier is bound to know whether it has delivered to the right person or according to instructions. This argument, however, even with respect to the particular carrier which makes a misdelivery, loses sight of the practical object in view. In fact, the transactions of a railroad company are multitudinous, and are carried on U.S. 190, 196 through numerous employees of various grades. Ordinarily the managing officers, and those responsible for the settlement and contest of claims, would be without actual knowledge of the facts of a particular transaction. The purpose of the stipulation is not to escape liability, but to facilitate prompt investigation. And, to this end, it is a precaution of obvious wisdom, and in no respect repugnant to public policy, that the carrier by its contracts should require reasonable notice of all claims against it even with respect to its own operations.|$|E
