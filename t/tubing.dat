5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium <b>tubing</b> impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel <b>tubing</b> is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium <b>tubing</b> for low pressure systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s. Plastic <b>tubing</b> systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the <b>tubing</b> systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, there have been various DEHP-plasticized PVC medical devices used in clinics, such as blood bags, {{infusion}} or transfusion <b>tubings,</b> enteral and parenteral nutritional <b>tubings,</b> cardiopulmonary bypass <b>tubings,</b> hemodialysis systems, various tube systems for blood cell separation machines, heat lung packs and leukocyte-reducing filter sets. Of {{the most widely used}} devices, nearly half come into contact with human blood or blood components.|$|R

5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the <b>tubing</b> and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the <b>tubing</b> as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E

5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy <b>tubing,</b> the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the <b>tubing</b> dimensions.|$|E
40|$|Pellethane ® 2363 80 A {{films and}} <b>tubings</b> were {{chemically}} modified {{and the effect}} of these modifications on platelet deposition was studied. Grafting of high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) and graft polymerization of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) 400 methacrylate resulted in surfaces with a good water wettability. The increased hydrophilicity of these modified surfaces could be demonstrated by contact angle measurements. The platelet deposition was investigated with <b>tubings</b> in a capillary flow system, using different types of perfusates. Platelet deposition from a buffer-containing perfusate on surfaces modified with either high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) or methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) 400 methacrylate was almost absent and less than on Pellethane 2363 80 A. Using a citrated plasmacontaining perfusate the amount of deposited platelets on Pellethane 2363 80 A modified with high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) was low and about the same as on unmodified surfaces. However, a marked reduced platelet deposition compared to unmodified Pellethane 2363 80 A was found when the platelets were activated by Ca 2 + ionophore. The improved blood compatibility of the modified Pellethane 2363 80 A <b>tubings</b> obviously indicates the favourable effect of the presence of grafted PEO on the surface...|$|R
40|$|Underground test {{sites for}} {{disposal}} of {{high-level radioactive waste}} (HLW) are commonly equipped with instrumentation for documentation {{of the evolution of}} engineered barriers and of changes in the physical state of the host rock. The rate of hydration of the clay buffer surrounding waste canisters determines the physical interaction with the rock and waste canisters and is recorded by use of RH meters and by measuring the swelling pressure exerted on cells installed in the clay. They are connected to cables and <b>tubings</b> extending to the recording units placed in room atmosphere. If they pass from the rock through the buffer groundwater under pressure can migrate through or along bunches of cables and <b>tubings</b> and reach the points of measurement earlier than in clay without instrumentation. The inconvenience is avoided by tight embedment of individual cables and <b>tubings</b> and placement of the pressure gauges such that they do not pass through the clay. Incorrect rates of hydration has led to the inadequate conclusion that water flows in unsaturated parts of the buffer according Darcy’s law while it is in fact migrating by coupled diffusion processes.

5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead <b>tubing</b> to operate pneumatic valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|At {{one time}} the largest Orthodox {{congregation}} in the Southern United States, its membership was over 500 families in the 1960s, but fell to under 200 by 2005. That year its Canal Boulevard building was severely flooded by the 2005 New Orleans levee failure disaster during Hurricane Katrina. Despite attempts to save them, all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed, as were over 3,000 prayer books. The building suffered further flooding damage caused by the theft of copper air-conditioning <b>tubing</b> in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper <b>tubing</b> for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{analysis}} of nanoliter droplets is proposed, which is profitable when larger samples cannot be collected as, for instance, in the case of several biological fluids and particularly in clinical chemistry. A glass capillary associated to a micromanipulator is used to collect submicroliter volumes which are partially transferred into transparent polymeric <b>tubings</b> with known internal diameters (120 - 178 mu m), where the volumes sampled are measured by meniscus collimations with a collimator microscope at suitable magnification. Both ends of these <b>tubings</b> are preliminarily equipped with ferrules and fittings. so as to make them suitable: for connection as the loop to a conventional high-pressure injection valve. The reliability of this procedure has been tested {{for the analysis}} of Na+, K+ and Ca 2 + present in minute synthetic standard samples (10 - 200 nL) by a conventional ion-chromatographic instrumentation. Relative standard deviations in peak area measurements (5 - 6 %) are discussed in terms of the whole approximation affecting volume measurements, which depends on both the inconstancy of the inner diameter of the polymeric <b>tubings</b> employed and the uncertainty characterizing meniscus collimations. The proposed procedure can be easily extended to the determination of any organic or inorganic species present in very small samples, provided that their detection can be achieved by any chromatographic approach or. more generally, by flow injection analysis...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tubings</b> of the {{aqueduct}} seen {{at ground}} level {{is made out of}} local granite (there are two kinds in this area), and so is everything else. The sections are little over 1 meter long with square cross section of 4 dms and bore of 1dm radius. Each sections has male and female end with fits fairly snugly into its neighbour. Most have a square hole upwards which is capped with a stone and a kind of concrete. The same concrete is used to seal the gaps in the connections. The upper hole is opened in order to clean the <b>tubings,</b> especially to remove the so-called fox tails (raposas) which are bundles of tree roots invading the aqueducts. Some loose pieces of the aqueduct are on display next to Mãe de àgua do Dr Alvim de cima.|$|R

5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel <b>tubing,</b> as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E

5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal <b>tubing</b> systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory <b>tubing,</b> pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo <b>tubing</b> and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC <b>tubing</b> which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
